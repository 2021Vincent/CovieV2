This 1966 classic directed by Sergio Leone stars Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach as three gunslingers who race to find a buried treasure during the American Civil War.The film is a slow burn, but it's also incredibly entertaining from start to finish. The cinematography is stunning, with wide shots of the desert landscapes and close-ups of the actors' faces that convey a range of emotions. The score by Ennio Morricone is unforgettable and is arguably one of the most iconic soundtracks in movie history.What makes The Good, The Bad, The Ugly so special is how it subverts the traditional Western tropes. The characters are not simply black-and-white, but rather nuanced and complex. Each of them has their own motivations and agendas, which clash with one another throughout the film.Overall, The Good, The Bad, The Ugly is a cinematic masterpiece that has stood the test of time. It's a must-watch for any movie lover, regardless of whether you're a fan of Westerns or not.Ranking: 10/10 \ud83d\udd25Fun Fact: Did you know that the film's iconic final scene, in which Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Wallach face off in a three-way duel, was actually filmed in Spain?

So even into his senior years, no one knew his real name. I tell you this to establish his cowboy movie bonafides. He and my father would often quiz each other into the night around a campfire about famous stars and they seemed to agree that Lash LaRue was the best, but then again, Lee Van Cleef was the best bad guy.We Italians know something of Westerns.After the success of For a Few Dollars More, United Artists approached the film's screenwriter, Luciano Vincenzoni, to sign a contract for the rights to this film and the next one. Producer Alberto Grimaldi, director Sergio Leone and he had no plans, but with their blessing, Vincenzoni came up with the idea of three rogues - the Man With No Name (Clint Eastwood), Tuco Benedicto Pac\u00edfico Juan Mar\u00eda Ram\u00edrez (Eli Wallach) and Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) - seeking hidden gold sometime after the Civil War. They got a bigger budget, Eastwood got $250,000, a Ferrari and a percentage, then the camera rolled.This would be the last role that Eastwood would do for Leone, who he saw as too much of a perfectionist. Harmonica in Once Upon a Time In the West would go to the man who was originally going to play Angel Eyes, Charles Bronson.The film begins with Angel Eyes killing men on his way to finding Confederate gold while The Man With No Name and Tuco keep pulling a scam where The Man collects the bounty on Tuco's head, saves him and then they do it again in a different town. After dealing with Tuco's constant complaining, he finally strands him in the desert and the \"Rat,\" as Eastwood's character describes him, gets his revenge by marching him across the same hot and desolate no man's land.The twists and turns of this movie find a man named Bill Carson (Antonio Casale) burying gold in one grave in a cemetery. Tuco knows the name of the burial ground while The Man knows the grave. $200,000 worth of gold is hidden away, which is a lot of money even today, so you can imagine why everyone is willing to do anything for it.American audiences were tired of Italian cowboys by this point and who can say why they were so dumb? Roger Ebert realized this and said that he \"described a four-star movie, but only gave it three stars, perhaps because it was a Spaghetti Western and so could not be art.\"As bad as Van Cleef seems on screen, he did have some rules about being a good person in his real life. He was supposed to slap around Maria (Rada Rassimov) in one scene and said, \"I can't hit a woman.\" Rassimov told him, \"Don't worry. I'm an actress. Even if you slap me for real, it's no problem\", but that's a double slapping her. Van Cleef said, \"There are very few principles I have in life. One of them is I don't kick dogs, and the other one is I don't slap women in movies.\"Even the name of this movie is ironic, used past film and having a meaning in actual life. The Mexican standoff found its way into many movies, particularly the work of Quentin Tarantino, who said that the final scene is his favorite of all time: \"During the three-way bullring showdown at the end, the music builds to the giant orchestra crescendo, and when it gets to the first big explosion of the theme there's a wide shot of the bullring. After you've seen all the little shots of the guys getting into position, you suddenly see the whole wideness of the bullring and all the graves around them. It's my favorite shot in the movie, but I'll even say it's my favorite cut in the history of movies.\"", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Great!", "date": "2023-05-01T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9026458", "sentiment score": [0.1115, 0.2417, 0.2514, 0.2855, 0.1099]}, {"content": "There is no doubt that the Spaghetti Western genre saved what was a dying Western genre.

Blondie (the good), Tuco (the ugly), and Angel Eyes (the bad). Angel eyes is in persuit of a man named Bill Carson, who knows the location of this gold, Blondie and Tuco happen upon Carsons body in his last breaths. He tells Tuco the cemetery name and Blondie the grave, therefore the two men need each other alive (they've been trying to kill each other all movie). Later they are prisoners of war when Angel Eyes pulls them aside and questions Tuco. After him and Blondie set off for the grave, Tuco escapes the train, reunites with Blondie, and they kill all of Angel's men. After spending some time on the front lines of the civil war, Tuco and Blondie reach the cemetery, Angel Eyes shorty after as well. Blondie reveals that the grave Tuco was digging is a fake, and he writes the grave name on a rock, placing it between the 3 men. An epic, tense standoff ensues and Angel eyes is killed by Blondie, who unloaded Tucos gun the day before. They get the money, and Blondie forces tuco to stand on a grave cross, with his head in a noose as he rides off. After a minute he doubles back and shoots the rope - just like old times!Its worth noting this is my first official western movie, so I do not have the context of other films in this genre to compare to. I've heard this movie redefined the genre and added a uniqueness, but I can't speak to that.Its hard for a youngin like me to appreciate just how big of a deal this movie was when it came out. It reminded me of a Tarantino film in so many ways - the signature score that would pop up out of no where at times (drawing attention to itself), the crash zooms, freeze frames, and just the fact its such a stylized film. I simply compare to Tarantino because he uses these techniques, but of course this was somehow made in 1967. I almost took it for granted while watching because it has that flare and style of a new movie. Sergio Leone was incredibly ahead of his time here and pioneered a multitude of technical and storytelling concepts behind the camera. As far as the story though - it was amazing. I was never sure what direction it would take and everything was unexpected but made sense (for the most part). The journey is almost comical from a priest monastery, to prisoners of war, to the front lines of the civil war, blowing up a bridge. Its clever and engaging, fun but deathly serious. The ending twists were incredible, the fake grave, no name on the stone, unloading the gun, leaving Tuco then coming back. Blondie's character is such a smart, cool and confident badass. The score is unreal, it meshes so well with the movie and works in unison that the entire thing just seems as one final product, like no other score could have worked.Sure, it could have done way worse for a three hour movie, but I was a bit bored throughout. No matter how good the movie three hours is a long time to sit and stay engaged so I have to admit it felt long and i had to cut my viewing into two parts. The story felt a bit convenient at times, for example Blondie somehow knew Tuco escaped the train and popped up in his room, knowing he was in the town somehow and knowing the exact room? Convenient or unexplained small things happened throughout and they werent huge, but enough for me to notice.I can't help but get caught up in the reputation this movie has. I think to myself, if I watched this with no idea as to the impact this movie had culturally or cinematically - what would I think? Its near impossible to separate the film from the context around it though. It holds up exceptionally well today (save for some horrible audio dubbing), but I don't know if it warrants an 8.8 on IMDB or 97% on Rotten Tomatoes. Perhaps once I watch more westerns in the future, I will recognise just how special this movie is.Overall, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly was undoubtedly ahead of its time with direction and style that that sticks out like a sore thumb (the good kind). The story is clever and well crafted, the look and feel hardened and badass, yet funny.

This is the mother of westerns. Can't find many weak points and I have to admit it has to be one of the best movies ever.First of all, the music must be mentioned. Ennio Morricone's score is unbeatable. It is undoubtedly one of the best scores ever. The film would have been nothing without the music. Scenes, where Tuco runs around for several minutes, would have been boring without the music. Add the music and you have one of the most iconic scenes ever. You can not look at a western movie without hearing this music play. It's so iconic that even if you have not seen the movie, you will have heard the score.It's an old film with old camera technology. This is where the film may lose many viewers. The last thing a western film - which is mostly set in an ugly and bleak desert - needs is bad cinematography. The cinematography is good for its time, but of course, it is not as strong today almost 60 years later. The camera work is impressive, but the technology hinders it. Fortunately, the score saves the sometimes very blurry and low-resolution images.The composition is perfect. So many new movies are heavily inspired by the photography from this movie. Director Sergio Leone is a master of visual storytelling. Many scenes do not even contain dialogue, but it is still clear what is going on. Small grimaces from the actor or small movements from the camera tell us enough. It is perfect.An example of visual storytelling is the scene when Tuco tries to find Eastwood's character. He follows a trail where someone has set several campfires. At these campfires, he finds Eastwood's old cigars. We know he's very close when he lifts a cigar and it's still smoking. The end of the film is also an exemplary example of visual storytelling. It is a fantastic feeling when you understand what is happening in the scene without dialogue. It's brilliantly done.All actors are good. Both the ugly and the good are good, but the bad gets too little screen time. The bad / Angel Eyes is played very well by Lee Van Cleef. He's a bit creepy while also being very charismatic. Nobody delivers a performance worthy of an Oscar, but it's solid acting from everyone involved.In conclusion, a legendary film that everyone must see. It has inspired countless amazing works.

I think a movie could be made just about this character. He is actually pure and sympathetic. He is ruthless in his fad moments, but like the other two characters, he is incapable of making plans. Bad is the dictionary meaning of charisma. Disciplined enough to do his job properly. The good character is slippery. He makes a deal with the criminals, delivers them to the law, gets the reward, then frees him from the rope, splits the money, and gives it back to the sheriff in another town.All the music of the movie is signed by Ennio Morricone and is magnificent. The intros are flawless. The scenes are remembered for their music. My favorite is the L'estasi Dell'oro music, especially when Tuko searches for the name in the tomb.The movie has great jokes and funny moments.

Why? Well, where to start......the storyThis movie has a simple plot: Three guys searching for 200.000 dollars. But what's wring about a simple story? Right, absolutely NOTHING. Especially if it's so good working like in this film. All three characters have unique trait marks that play a big role during the 2 hours 50. And lets talk about this rather long running time. You won't feel the lenght at all! There is not a single moment I felt bored and the pacing is very slow. And because of that slow pacing the finale is even more satisfying.One of the most tenseful moments of cinema history: The Showdown. And that leds me to......the musicEnnio Morricone. One name. More shouldn't I have to say. The man, the legend, master of his profession. Just the music during The Showdown is enough to say that without his music the movie would be easily one point lower rated. There is little music that everybody can identify easier with a whole genre than his. But he is just the first of the three legends that created this movie's legacy. Lets focus on......the directingSergio Leone. Without this guy the western genre would just consist of John Waynes movies and a few unknown. The genre would not have become this important as it was. The unique style of his directing build a whole new subgenre: The italo-western. When watching his movies you know that he made them, the emotions of the characters are depicted in a way never seen before. Just look at the showdown scene. It's brilliant. But of course this is only possible because of the third person that defined the movie. Let's talk about.......the actingClint Eastwood. Is there anybody who don't know this man? His unique performave as the man without a name during all three movies of the dollar trilogy is a masterpiece of it's own. When I think about a cowboy the image of Clint Eastwood is in front of my eyes. This guy defined the genre like no other (even John Wayne) and is one of the best actors Hollywood has ever seen. This guy is a phenomenon!So let's summarize that, you have a powerful story with one of the greatest finales of all time, the trio of perfection giving you masterclass music, directing and acting and 2 hours and 50 minutes full of entertaining.It's hard to beat that, it may even impossible to top that.

The cinematography is generally smooth and beautiful despite a few close shots that are an inch or so out of focus. Clint Eastwood's 'Good', despite being a completely one dimensional character, is effortlessly cool and perfectly cast, and Lee Van Cleef's 'The Bad' sends a shiver down your spine.

The story is meant to be unfolded with 3 protagonists, but actually only two are the actual heroes (antiheroes). I don't really see the correspondence between the Bad and the other two, which made it quite confusing when I was expecting three persons' story intertwined. The Bad is quite static and two dimensional. Tuco is a successful character though. I see his personality fully elaborated and almost all of his behaviors are explained with his history. The best part is when he met his priest brother and said something like \"from where we were born, the only ways to survive are either to be a priest or a bandit.\" It is like a response to Stendhal's The Red and The black where the situation is either to be a priest or an aristocrat. The time sets in civil war America, where aristocracy life is out of the picture. That plot alone evolved Tuco from a dumb gangster to a complex and somewhat lovely character who we can sympathize. While the Good, although better depicted than the Bad, is not very successful neither. The storyteller apparently wanted to make his line a crucial thread, but we still don't know why he is the good one. He is not any better than Tuco, because they all kill people for a living. Sometimes he cares for others but that's not enough to turn our perspective on him from bad to good. Yup, he is attractive, but still - not enough. None of his history is told, so we don't have any evidence to understand his conducts as a whole. It's a pretty nice western though, but I do think there can be more.

I always enjoyed it. Surely, it is long; some sequences are truly challenging the audience's patience. On the other hand, it might be why this movie has stood the test of time, because it does things slowly but surely, and masterfully.The film consists of vignettes i.e. The characters go through a series of self contained various situations. The overall plot is that they're travelling through America, in the mist of the Civil War to find a buried treasure. Vignettes is the understood term for this form of storytelling, however a vignette is a very small image, barely larger than a stamp. Here, given the tone and tempo, it almost feels appropriate to describe them as frescoes. This film is big and epic in every sense.It is a Western, in the sense that it has cowboys, revolvers and horses. Yet, it actually is a fully blown war epic, and our protagonist travel between both sides. Sergio Leone's whole approach with Westerns was both a sobering look but also a farce. It was at the same time: a mirror of the projected American image and a satirical riff of that image. If we push that metaphor, these films are like distorting carnival mirrors.Ironically, that exaggerated hyperbolic look feels very real. Which is telling of how fake and superficial the Hollywood Westerns were but also how correctly the Italian films captured the essence of the Old West and of that Frontier spirit. It feels more real and authentic and spiritually meaningful than any other film of that genre and most of cinema in general. Because it is so effortlessly a farce of the previous standards and a challenge of our preconceived notions; it allows itself to be a better representation of reality. Not only does it better encapsulate the idea of the Far West it also better represents the idea of America itself.Here in particular, the theme of the Civil war itself is treated realistically and as a rebuke of the dominant (\"American mainstream\") narrative. It is done by mainly showing the Rebels as victims or losers and by showcasing a very brutal prison camp run by the North. I don't get the feeling that this movie is apologetic of the Southern cause, or that it tries to re-write history. If the film has a core message it certainly could be that \"War is Hell\" no matter on which side of justice you are. Yet, it allows us the viewer to empathise with the characters, the men that fought and died not just with the armies or the sides.Those are the kind of things this movie makes you think of. It is rare for a film, especially a Western, to show the bad guys having humanity and showing that the good guys were not always good or rightful or motivated by pure and noble intentions. Obviously, those concepts are discomforting and challenging. Yet, it works because the film does it sincerely.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Big and epic in every sense !", "date": "2022-09-27T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8571761", "sentiment score": [0.0203, 0.1476, 0.3446, 0.4277, 0.0597]}, {"content": "Watching every scene is scripted, shot and acted makes me think of a perfect art form, where nothing can be added or subtracted.

What can there be said of TGTBTU that hasn't been already. This is the first time I've seen it fully, just a few memes here and there so I know a couple shots/scenes. The bias and the hype surrounding this movie is undoubtedly affecting my feelings towards it. But here we go. In comparison I rate this movie the same as the two that came before, both are great stories with solid acting and directing. TGTBTU wins an extra point for simply being the more technically sound movie out of the bunch.I watched the Remastered version, though the versions of this movie are a mess. The version I watched didn't have the chicken scene nor the new and very ugly gun sound effects. This seemed like the very best version to watch. No unnecessary scene and the guns sound like they sound in the previous two movies and keep their iconic ''twang'' and ''whines'' imo.The characters here are great but it puts a strong focus on Tuco, which coming into the movie from the previous in the Trilogy I did not expect. I expected Eastwood to get the most time and development. But no, Tuco really is the main character in my opinion as he get's the most ups and downs, the character development, and simply the most screen time. Blondie at times really feels like just a sidekick, though a sidekick that's ''in charge'' if that makes sense. Sentenza (Van Cleef) is fantastic but I wished he got more screen time. He disappears sometimes a bit too long. Tuco is a fine character, but he is erratic and a bit silly, I get how people would get turned off by his demeanor and dislike the movie a bit when the character gets so much time.Music is ... well once again, I think I've said this with all 3 movies: Iconic. But the soundtrack you hear in this movie is what everyone thinks of when you say western. There's no stronger defining soundtrack for westerns than the one found here. And of course there's bias for it. But it is incredible. Used not too much, making you eager to hear it again.Sound is much better overall in this. But still it tough to get through the louder scenes due to how bloated the sound gets. It's a sign of the times but also budget and a lack of attention to detail regarding sound as other movies in this era don't all sound like this. The dubbing is much better though.Morality is also a fun aspect, as things are much greyer than they were previously. Blondie gets the ''good'' title but you quickly find out that ''good'' isn't as black and white as they make it seem. He still uses a criminal to make money from and his only goal is money. And kills bounty hunters who might be portrayed as nasty but as far as we knew are good men trying to catch a criminal. The ugly is just a bad person no doubt. And Sentenza, well, his prison camp practices obviously are what make him the most evil. But A paid hitman makes him no more evil than Blondie, and they all want money so you can't say that is the differentiator.In a weird way as well this movie feels like the prequel to AFFOD because Blondie only gets his iconic hat and poncho later in the movie. The only problem would be the money he takes with him as that wouldn't give him reason to care for the small amounts of money in the AFFOD...or he's that addicted to making money. Anyways it almost could've been a prequel. Though either way this ''Trilogy'' is has many actors playing different characters you really have to split them apart anyways.Now the question comes which of the three of the trilogy do I like the most, based on score it should be this but it isn't. It's a bit too long and a bit too much sideplot and focus on Tuco. I think Volont\u00e8 is really the actor I missed. Van Cleef is a great villain, a morally somewhat grey villain but still and I guess Tuco is a villain as well. That said I like the balance of characters and actors a lot more in FAFDM and I think that is my favorite at this time. I'm sure to rewatch this trilogy but for now FAFDM is it.Been a great experience watching the beginning of the spagetti westerns, now onto the next.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "The Good, The Bad and The Ugly", "date": "2022-08-27T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8492050", "sentiment score": [0.009, 0.0545, 0.2746, 0.5751, 0.0868]}, {"content": "A bounty hunting scam joins two men in an uneasy alliance against a third in a race to find a fortune in gold buried in a remote cemetery.This film is the greatest western of all time. That's no hot take, and for a good reason. This film's style, music, cinematography, characters, everything is just the definitive old west style that everyone knows today.Spaghetti westerns are known for their bold, action-packed and often violent styles. But this provides more than just the canon and fistfights that the genre is known for bringing.The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a masterpiece for many reasons, one of which being its runtime. It is one of the longest westerns ever made, just short of two hours, which guffaws at the hour-and-twenty-minute runtime that most westerns had. This film stretches out scenes to their limits, building extreme intensity, and making their conclusions all the more satisfying. The way the film is stretched out with unnecessary scenes and unnecessarily long scenes makes the ten-minute ending scene one of the most intense and greatest in film history.This isn't just a western for fun shoot-outs. It's an emotional film, providing backstories, and making its characters seem so simple, and yet so great. Especially 'The Ugly', Tuco. He is ugly in his actions, not his words, and as greedy as he is, he has a whole six-minute backstory scene, that will make viewers feel emotions as strong as seeing a bloody fistfight.The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is one of the greatest movies of all time, and may be the best western. Of course there are other masterpieces in the competition-High Noon, The Searchers, etc. But for all the emotion and fascination packed into the others, this film here is for all viewers. It's 3-hour runtime will leave viewers thinking there's more to go. It goes by too quickly, and yet you feel how long it is. Long enough to make each of the three main characters much more than just the words to describe them.The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a retrospective western, although many people don't talk about that. But it's the end of one of the most basic western plot ideas-there's an object of desire, there's a lone, heroic drifter, there's a partner/other competitor who wants the riches and there's loads of action. This film fleshes out all of these aspects more than any other western, and that makes their end feel like the end of an era. And indeed, it was. In America, westerns were fading out of popularity. But in Italy, with the smash success of director Sergio Leone's previous other films and the rise of new western stars like Franco Nero and Lee Van Cleef was the beginning of a new era of westerns. A more daring, more gritty one. The American westerns of old were of course great. Amazing artistic achievements about times that some of those filmmakers even witnessed. But the average b-western from that time was just that-average. There's little action, more one-dimensional romantic plots. But the average spaghetti western has at least two memorable and creative fight scenes, and while their characters were basic, they generally carried more depth, even if still not always much. I'm definitely not hating on classic American westerns. I love those. But I'm just trying to explain how genius and relevant The Good, the Bad and the Ugly was.This film is one that everyone should and could see. If you are willing to sit through 3 hours, then you will have a great time, even if you don't like westerns or old movies. Because this is as modern as any film from the time period. This is one of the greatest movies of all time. And while many modern audiences don't want to watch something like the great Citizen Kane or another masterpiece like The Godfather, this film is pure popcorn entertainment, as well as a great, character-driven film.

The apotheosis of tension and the end of one long adventure. \"Good, Bad, Ugly\" made me immerse myself in what was happening with my soul and eyes. Just as it was created by the brilliant Sergio Leone.Blond (Clint Eastwood) is a laconic, wise character with penetrating eyes. Nothing will confuse him - neither a gun at his temple, nor forty-degree heat. He seems to be for justice, but on the other hand, the feeling that the hero is pursuing his own interests does not leave. Cowboy skirmishes taught Blondin to make decisions with lightning speed, but carefully.Clint Eastwood for me (and for millions of American viewers) is the standard: a role model for every boy from the cinemas of the 60s. Green-eyed, tall .. An icon of masculinity with unlimited authority in Hollywood and among ordinary people.Evil or Tuco (Eli Wallach) - at first glance, a vile criminal with rat-like features, ready to betray his own mother for a bundle of dollars. A typical representative of the \"nothing sacred\" class. A vindictive person, incapable of appreciating the kindness of others (in response to saving his life and sacks of gold, the Blonde heard only angry scolding from Tuko). But for even a little childish naivety of the hero, the audience has compassion and indulgence for the bandit Tuco. He is not cruel. He just understands only in his business and puts it above everything else. A great addition to Blond (the complete opposite of Tuko, by the way).Bad or Angelo (Lee van Cleef) - the viewer is familiar with van Cleef from the second part of the \"a few dollars more\" trilogy. But this time the actor opens up in the role of a negative hero, and not a conscientious colonel. To be honest, there were doubts that Leone would be able to \"wipe\" the image of Douglas Mortimer from his memory. But both the director and the actor did a great job. Lee van Cleef played brilliantly and in a different way - exactly as the viewer demanded. As Leone intended.25% of the picture's legend, if you will, is definitely Ennio Moricone's soundtrack. Inspiring, inducing goosebumps, it is invigoratingly combined with the same epic, unforgettable scenes of the film, forever remaining in the archive of cinema classics. I take my hat off to Mr. Morricone, without whose compositions it is now impossible to imagine the best western in history.If humanity were allowed to save only two films from the apocalypse, what other film would you save?There was a desire to save this masterpiece for future generations.Sergio Leone hit right in the heart10 out of 10.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 3}, "heading": "Western - good, bad, evil.

Its plot of bandits searching for treasure is seemingly simple, but deconstructs many ideals. The film examines notions of heroes, violence, war, and greed by presenting honest complexities. Protagonists are cruel, immorality is explained through backstories, violence is brutal, and war tragically destroys everything in its path. Thus, the self-interested characters are understandable reflections of their decaying world. Eastwood isn't deep, but Wallach counterbalances that with shifty desperation. Ultimately, this movie challenges viewers to reconsider romanticized ideals of action heroes who glorify violence in morally simplistic stories.Technically, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is equally naturalistic, yet vibrantly stylish. The production has gritty details, yet grand scope. The effects are elaborate, real, and downright dangerous. The cinematography combines picturesque wide-shots with striking close-ups. The editing slowly builds tension, yet erupts with dramatic cuts that elevate suspense. Plus, these aspects are unified by Leone's legendary direction, creating a rugged yet beautiful atmosphere that redefined cinema. Finally, Morricone's music is possibly the greatest score of all time. Consequently, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a cinematic marvel.

I don't know why so many Western movies use this ridiculous pinging/whistling sound which is nothing like a real gun. Also, shooting a revolver from inside the water in a bathtub? Absurd.Additionally Blondie is unrealistically accurate with his rifle, which makes crucial elements of the plot hard to believe. The cartridges of early repeating rifles were weak so he couldn't possibly have hit that far shot to save Tuco at the end, especially from a standing position. And even at close range, shooting a rope is extremely hard, yet we have to believe that he's done it reliably time and again with moments to spare before Tuco chokes out or a sheriff shoots back.The Civil War battle scene was silly, starting with the gratuitous use of excessively large artillery which wouldn't have a place at a New Mexico river crossing and whose practical effects were equally unconvincing. And of course all the cannon shells exploded on impact, no realistic fuses or canister shot, and I don't recall a single shot of a cannon actually being reloaded - all bad movie tropes which make the scene hard to believe. I got the sense that the director was (consciously or otherwise) trying to portray Civil War New Mexico with the zeitgeist surrounding WWI on the Western Front: ruinous, explosive artillery bombardment in the trenches followed by pointless charges over the top to please the higher command. That inappropriate transposition of themes made the battle scene feel uncreative and disconnected from the historical period.Additionally, the practice of two sides simultaneously charging into the bridge at each other was completely illogical, it would clearly be better to sit in the trenches and defend while the enemy bottlenecks through the bridge. I know that part of the vision of the film was to communicate the senselessness of war, but portraying both armies as having implausibly stupid leadership isn't a good way achieve that.The famous final scene was very cool with the running through the graves but then it went off the rails. First, I was able to deduce the truth about the treasure after Arch Stanton's grave turned up empty. The only way that Blondie could know that there was a grave for \"Arch Stanton\" would be that the treasure clue said something about Arch Stanton, he couldn't have just made up a name that coincidentally belonged to someone at that cemetery. So the clue would have to mention Stanton's grave, and an unmarked grave right next to it would be the obvious answer. Tuco or Angel Eyes should have been able to figure this out and then realize that they didn't need to keep Blondie alive anymore. Or Blondie should have been smart enough to foresee this problem and not try that plan in the first place.Additionally, it doesn't make any sense why Blondie pretended to write the real name onto the rock, nor does it make sense why he got the three of them into that standoff. Actions which did nothing but increase his disposability in the eyes of the other two, putting him in greater danger of being killed.I think Blondie is meant to be a moral or spiritual character who does things to serve a bigger purpose beyond himself, to provide some kind of lesson or poetic justice to Tuco and Angel Eyes. Yet the details of such a characterization and how it might explain his actions are totally unintelligible to me at least from a first watch.By far the most obvious explanation is that the director imagined it would be really cool to have this three-way standoff scene so he just had the main character do something to make it happen, without regard for actual logic and characterization. And once you notice that, the scene isn't so cool anymore.The movie is too long, it's a relatively simple plot with too many filler scenes which are not efficient at characterizing the trio. The Tuco-Blondie dynamic was good at least.

I mentioned Ennio Morricone, the background scorer of this movie, cause he is one of the most important person who make this movie great.

The pacing is incredible, as is the direction - Sergio Leone manages to build a lot of uncomfortable tension in the film which keeps you engage.The three main characters make the film. Lee Van Cleef ('The Bad') is evil personified. Totally ruthless, he'll do whatever it takes to get what he wants. Clint Eastwood ('The Good') is the Man With No Name, not really 'good' in a traditional sense . . . But he has a certain sense of honor and tries to do the right thing. (Watch the scene when he gives a dying Confederate soldier a puff of his cigar - powerful, and it sums up everything that the Man With No Name is all about, without saying a single word.) Eli Wallach ('The Ugly') is Tuco, and he's easily the most complex - if not the best - character in the film. All impulse and rage, Tuco spins wildly throughout the movie, stealing, lying, pretending to be Clint Eastwood's best friend in one scene, trying to kill him in another - Tuco truly represents 'the ugly' side of people.At last I wanna say even if you are not into the western genre then just try it out.

Sure, I could remember the general outlay of the movie, but I have to say that it was a blast to sit down and watch Sergio Leone's classic Western movie once again.It is easy to see why Sergio Leone's \"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly\" is a classic Western in every aspect, from the narrative storyline, the acting performances, the cast, the atmosphere, and of course the music.Now, the storyline, as written by Luciano Vincenzoni, Sergio Leone, Agenore Incrocci and Furio Scarpelli certainly is an interesting and entertaining one, as there are lots of great moments throughout the course of the 2 hours and 41 minutes that the movie run for. And I will say that I was genuinely entertained from start and up to the very end of the movie.They certainly had an intersting cast ensemble for this movie, and of course the likes of Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef needs no introduction, as they are iconic actors in themselves, but I will say that\nEli Wallach was actually also adding a good portion of character building to the storyline with his performance and role in the movie.As a Western movie, then \"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly\" takes the audience on a wild horseback chase, as we go through a lot of Western tropes as the movie progress. But it works out well, because the storyline is so nicely constructed and brought to life on the screen.The music in \"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly\" is iconic. And I am sure that just about everyone is familiar with the classic melody that dominates the movie.\"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly\" is Western done right, and it certainly is a movie that you should watch if you enjoy Western movies, or if you're a fan of Clint Eastwood or Lee Van Cleef.

Still plenty of iconic scenes there, and I think the last 20-30 minutes wouldn't be nearly as impactful if that first hour or so had been edited right down.Speaking of the final 20-30 minutes, everything that happens from the bridge scene onwards is just some of the best stuff I've ever seen in a movie. My heart was racing even though this was probably about the fourth time I've watched this movie. Everything in the cemetery is like 12/10 good; I can't even put it into words. The music is godlike, with Ecstasy of Gold and the track that plays during the three-way duel among Morricone's best (and let's not ignore the fact that the rest of the soundtrack is incredible).It's arguably Clint's best role, too, and even then, he's often foreshadowed by an even better Eli Wallach, who dominates the screen in creating one of the best characters of all time, Tuco. While Lee Van Cleef isn't given as much to do, he's also fantastic, especially in his first couple of scenes, which establish how cruel and calculating Angel Eyes is.The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is just about perfect.

As it has been throughout the trilogy, Morricone's music is phenomenal yet again. It gave me chills when the trio entered the final circle thanks to an iconic score. Although I enjoyed the last two hours more or less I can't help but notice the flaws in the plot and how it is progressing.First of all the first hour drags a lot, it is whole exposition, establishing relationship between the Good, the bad & the Ugly and giving us a proper context for the three characters. But some scenes there felt unnecessary and dragged on for too long. I was bored by that first hour but it really picks up after that till the end.The plot seems too convenient and dumb at times. Although I liked another theme of the civil war being introduced in the film, I didn't liked how the cannon shots were conveniently dropping around \"The good\" as he just can't die. It was like he didn't just had skills but also a lot of luck on his side. The bridge exploding scene is also not executed very well. They just carry a giant box with \"EXPLOSIVES\" written on it and nobody even questions it. They were able to plant those and get back to safety and then survive the canon shower afterwards pretty easily, very convenient again. Some of the characters also seem pretty dumb in the choices they make. I felt like it took me out of the film, because either the characters are too naive & dumb or it is manipulated just to keep the three characters alive.I think For a Few Dollars More is the best of the trilogy. I agree that the camera work, scenes and themes are much better and more complex in this one. The characters, the music, and the plot is much better in the second film of the trilogy in my opinion. This film was missing the organic devlopment or progression of character and plot and it seemed a bit manufactured.After all this it may seem like I hated the film but since it is heralded as one the greatest films of all time I had to point out why it was not so for me. I still enjoyed the film especially for all the action, music and those epic shots of the final sequence, and that one of the whole graveyard with Tuco running was so reflective and touching for me.

The year 1939 is tabbed best in film and it's hard to dispute with makes like Gone-With-the-Wind The-Wizard-of-Oz The-Women Goodbye-Mr-Chips Stagecoach and The-Hunchback-of-Notre-Dame. Then there's 1967, no runner-up as it produced more game-changers than any other: Guess-Whos-Coming-To-Dinner In-the-Heat-of-the-Night Bonnie-and-Clyde The-Graduate To-Sir-With-Love Cool-Hand-Luke and The-Good, a Western like no other, featuring an anti-hero that made the rest look like boy scouts. Filmed in Italy and Spain, terrain which compares to the southwest US, and scripted by a team of writers (Incrocci Leone Scarpelli Vincenzoni Donati Knox), Good had the biggest Produzioni budget and it shows.Set during the Western phase of the Civil War, it follows 2 non-combatants, Blondie the good (Clint) and Tuco the ugly (Eli) who partner in scam of criminal justice, then have a falling out, only to tenuously re-team in necessity when each is given partial clue to locating a buried Confederate gold shipment, swag also being sought by a well-informed, third gunslinger, the \"tidy\" bandito known as Angel Eyes (Lee). Shaky alliances form and fade, encountering family (Tuco's priestly brother) (Pistilli) and fighting along the way (a war weary Union Captain) (Giuffr\u00e8), culminating in a triangulated, graveyard showdown with only spirits of the dead in attendance to beckon new members. Most noteworthy for its performances in lead, signature English dubbing, epic length (177m), Ennio Morricone's singular score (Ah-eh-a-eh-aaaaaa, waaah WAAAAA waaah), advanced sound effects (Pacella DeSisti) and a persistent brutality, mitigated by a Tuco-Blondie entente that emerges late. The trouble today is too MUCH epic. Adding back edits merely to boost DVD sales or turn a Classic into a new movie so fiddlers can make it into the credits, is becoming a real problem. In what is known as the American Edition, 15 minutes in three needless scenes were added back: Tuco at his hideout talking to a dead chicken, lead-up to the monestary and Angel Eyes visits a CSA camp to pump a wine-dribbling Rebel. More is not always better. The presumption should be to protect earlier edits, whatever their motive, be it choisis or finance. They are the movie.The best Civil War treatment to date, Dances-With-Wolves the best opener (\"Get down Lieutenant, these guys are shooters!\"), by an Italian in Spain, no less. The Good is that rarity where a series finale, typically the weakest (T3 Alien-3), is instead best of the bunch, a film fantasy where bad guys aren't all bad, good guys have demons and YOU decide the moral. Is Good the best western ever made? After writing this review, I might say, yes, until I see Shane or Red River or Lonesome-Dove or The-Big-Country or Little-Big-Man or The-Searchers or Winchester-73 or The-Last-Picture-Show or, you get the idea.

Any cons noted are relative.I just feel like it's a drop-off from the brilliant double of 'A Fistful of Dollars' and 'For a Few Dollars More'. The near 3hr run time is one of the reasons, though the pacing is actually pretty good in fairness. I guess it's more so the plot, which is filled with an American Civil War setting which I didn't feel matched the characters.The man in the middle/bounty hunting aspects of the original two films are perfect for the characters of Clint Eastwood & Co., whereas them tagging along for the war just felt odd; the story didn't feel as raw or volatile to me.As stated, it's still - on its own merits - an entertaining western. Eastwood remains quality, while Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach are extremely worthy onscreen counterparts. I will say Van Cleef feels forgotten about, probably just by me, towards the end until he magically reappears. Still, as a trio they are really enjoyable. The plot away from the war is properly fun, much more in keeping to what I was expecting. The score is also awesome, yet again.Minus the ACW and a shorter run time and I'd probably be classing this as great as AFOD and FAFDM. It's still very good though, which I evidently want to stress, and I'd definitely revisit it.Watched: \"Extended English-language version\".Even though this version is the same as the original Italian release (177 minutes), but seemingly the US shortened run time is considered the true incarnation?

Well, my opinion of the film has honestly just degraded with time to the point where I throw this in, ready to rediscover the love for the film I saw in my youth, and instead I discover a bloated, aimless mess of a film.I swear I'm not trolling. I genuinely think this.I felt like For a Few Dollars More was a nearly ideal meld of style and somewhat minimal substance to create a high-quality entertainment. Leone had discovered that his style required small, focused storytelling, allowing him to spend large amounts of time on heightened moments that really drove the film's enjoyment. For the first half of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I had similar thoughts to the earlier parts of his previous two films. Leone was taking his time to introduce his characters and his world. It was more self-indulgent than previously, but it was still pretty consistently entertaining.We have our three characters, the Ugly (Tuco, played by Eli Wallach), the Bad (Angel Eyes, played by Lee Van Cleef), and the Good (Blondie, played by Clint Eastwood). Tuco is introduced in the opening sequence where he shoots several men out to kill him before jumping out of a window and racing off into the wilderness. Angel Eyes' first scene introduces the actual plot when he shows up to a remote house with orders to kill a man after he extracts some information from him, the pseudonym of a man along with some extra bits about a cash box. Blondie executes a con with Tuco in his first scene where he drops Tuco off in a town for a cash reward and shoots out the rope that's to hang him before Tuco actually strangles, dropping him onto the horse below and letting him bolt off to freedom where the two will share the money. However, Blondie decides that Tuco really isn't worth it, robs him blind, and leaves Tuco in the desert alone.This is all fine, solid, cinematic storytelling from Leone. It continues, if a bit self-indulgently, with Tuco crawling back to civilization and robbing a gun shop before heading towards Blondie. Eventually catching up, Tuco takes Blondie hostage and forces him to walk into the desert without water, enjoying every second of it, until they come across a seemingly abandoned Confederate stagecoach with a dying man who promises Tuco $200,000 for a drink of water. Fate makes it so that Tuco receives one piece of information about the money (the name of the cemetery) and Blondie receives the other (the name of the grave), with neither willing to give up the information to the other. However, they both need each other if they want that cash. This is also, of course, the man that Angel Eyes was looking for information on in his early scene.Tuco helps Blondie convalesce in a monastery that will treat soldiers on either side of the American Civil War, and this is pretty much the exact point where I feel like the movie ends its promise. A quality scene between Tuco and his monk brother leads to Tuco and Blondie leaving the monastery to head towards the cemetery. And immediately they're sidetracked when they get captured by a random Union patrol because the pair are wearing the Confederate uniforms they picked up. The story was just about to move forward, and suddenly we have to watch the two go into the Union's answer to Andersonville, complete with a subplot that goes nowhere about the commandant deciding to investigate Angel Eyes (who is now a sergeant in the Union Army? Whatever) for stealing from the prisoners as well as mistreating them. We literally never see the commandant after the scene he declares that he's going to investigate, so what's the point?What this prison setting is supposed to do narratively is to tell Angel Eyes that Tuco and Blondie have the information he seeks (the coincidences around this are rather large), and for Angel Eyes to learn enough that he just needs Blondie instead of Tuco when Tuco gives up the cemetery name. So, then they're off with Tuco set to be executed...somewhere else. Tuco manages to jump off a train with his large guard chained to him without anyone noticing, cutting the chains with the next train on the tracks. Yes, our story is moving forward again.In a town being evacuated, Blondie and Angel Eyes, along with Angel Eyes' five men, rest for a bit until Tuco shows up. Blondie decides team up with Tuco, presumably because Angel Eyes can't be trusted and he needs to whittle down Angel Eyes' men (an echo of For a Few Dollars More). The scene where they take out the five men is...curious. Saved by luck several times including a man with a rifle having worse aim than Tuco with a pistol (while also having the jump on him) and a shell landing right next to two of the men right before they are going to fire into the backs of Blondie and Tuco, they eliminate Angel Eyes' men, and then we're off to the cemetery.Except, that bridge sequence comes up. I still maintain that this sequence can be hard cut out of the film (though you'd need some ADR to get Blondie to give Tuco the name of the grave). It's a pointless sequence in terms of the actual story. Stopping the film completely so that we can get some obvious metaphor for the quagmire of Vietnam is bad enough, but then it stops making literal sense after a certain bit. Recalling The Bridge on the River Kwai, but without even trying to explain how two men could tie explosives to a bridge in broad daylight without being seen by the army looking straight at them, Blondie and Tuco blow up the bridge, ending the conflict, and letting them move onto the cemetery! Well, after Blondie has a tender moment with a dying soldier he's never seen before and expertly shoots a cannon at Tuco (twice!).And then we get our famous ending of Tuco, Blondie, and Angel Eyes at Sad Hill Cemetery. Yes, this ending is great. It's peak Leone in an individual sequence with a fantastic use of a fantastic score by Ennio Morricone, but it took us a meandering three hours to get here.I do not question the many, many people who hold up this film as one of their favorites and even their opinions of it being one of the greatest films ever made. I simply do not agree. There is no focus to this story. This is Leone going epic and having no idea how to do it. This is Leone wanting to say something about Vietnam but not really understanding how to actually integrate that message into the story at hand. This is Leone being given a huge budget based on the wild success of his previous two films and not really knowing what to do with all the resources.There's definitely entertainment to be had, but it's all mired in the middle of a story that never comes close to gelling, especially in its second half. Robbing itself of any narrative drive or even a basic point, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly becomes a tedious struggle.", "rating": 5, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 9}, "heading": "Bloated and Aimless", "date": "2021-11-01T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7501001", "sentiment score": [0.0225, 0.0759, 0.1283, 0.4523, 0.321]}, {"content": "I saw this movie when it first came out and liked it.

However, whether you have seen this picture or not, you have most likely heard its theme song in the past, even if you are not necessarily into movies. The main narrative, revolves around three men, on the search for Bill Carson $200,000 worth of gold buried in Sad Hill Cemetery with each one, wanting all of the prize to themselves, or so it seems. Before the release of this film, Sergio was known for his work on silence motion pictures, which explains the lack of dullness and exposition present in this movie. Instead Sergio is more known as a director that prefers situation over story lines, the characters find out about their problems around the same time, that the audiences do which makes it feel like you are also part of the situation. The cinematography of this picture, also compliments this point, as what ever is not included in the frame of the shot, not only can't the audiences see it, but the characters within the frame will not be able to see anyone that lays outside it. This is a great technique to subvert the audiences expectations of the given moment, when the viewers see a character surrounded by an obstacle that just so happens to seem unescapable, they may never know for sure, if the character time is up until its really over for them, as their help could easily be a couple inches away from the frame of the camera. The same thing goes for when the characters appear to be in a favourable and safe position, the danger could just be a few feet away, which also subverts our expectations, as if the characters feel like they are in control, it will make the viewers go under a false sense of security, therefore if the danger does approach, it tricks both the audience and the people within the frame.Sergio Leone, years of silence film making, comes into play when it comes to constructing suspense prior to the hits of an action sequence. He does this by lingering around the same pattern of switching shots between the character's faces, and cutting back to the previous character several times, when ever an important battle is about to go down. This is a great way of showing the evolution of a person's thought process, during the heat of the moment, as the character's plot their strike. He is also great at visual foreshadowing, for instances, when the first character to make a move, is about to strike, during that specific character thought process evolution, he would have multiple shots cut to that person's weapon, which shows the person that is going to deliver the first blow. However, what separates the tension developing process in this film, over other movies is the score by Ennio Morricone, without his theme, it wouldn't sell the importance of a situation as much as he did. Every time it plays, it comes off as like a ticking time bomb, where if one of the characters don't take the proper steps fast enough, they wouldn't come out alive.In conclusion this film is one of the best movies ever made, there are never any moments that feel dull or to drag the runtime, each scene has a reason for being there. However a nitpick that I would have with this film,(A small thing) is that sometimes there are moments that come off as way too convenient, like when two characters split up without plaining to meet each other at a certain time, somehow find each other again in a matter of minutes without supposing to. Also there was a scene where, just before a character is about to be finished, get saved by a cannonball from out of no where, that just so happens to land into the exact house that this person is in. Overall through, this film is a masterpiece, it feels much less than 2 hours and 58, there are so many intense moments from start to finish, with some of the best cinematography of all time considering the time it was made. This film is a gift to cinema, and has accomplished many aspects of film making and beyond, that no other western film can replicate to this day.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 4}, "heading": "It is THE western film from some time ago", "date": "2021-08-27T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7275923", "sentiment score": [0.0257, 0.0888, 0.2347, 0.47, 0.1807]}, {"content": "The conclusion of the Dollars trilogy lets Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach get tough. \"Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo\" (\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" in English) is more of an epic than the first two, but no less intense.

The old formula of civilised white heroes valiantly battling native savages, or po-faced lawman struggling to establish order in their immediate domain were replaced with an ironic, stylish, sui-generis swagger. The Good, The Bad and the The Ugly was the apotheosis of this reinvention. It was a Western but not as anyone had ever known it, it was a Western for a new generation: a more self-aware, savvier generation.Clint Eastwood is the face of this swagger. He is cool, calm and effortlessly heroic. A man of few words and no name, he represents the rugged charm of the old west. And is there any cinematic image more iconic than Eastwood squinting into the middle-distance, toothpick or cigar clenched between ivory teeth, muttering a laconic witticism to his unsuspecting, uncultured victim. Eastwood's persona was clearly drawn from the morally ambiguous heroes of classic film noir: think Humphrey Bogart from films such as \"The Maltese Falcon\" or \"The Big Sleep\". What's possibly even more impressive, however, are the number of archetypes this character was able to inspire: from 1980s action movie heroes, to more recent Marvel superheroes, there is a nod to one of cinema's most enduring influences: the original man with no name.One, of course, also has to mention Ennio Morricone's soundtrack: once heard it is never forgotten and even those who haven't watched the film will recognise it. It's pure genius in its simplicity and effectiveness. It reaches out and pulls you immediately into the action and atmosphere of the film.Personally, despite the above, I don't believe this film to be either Leone's or Morricone's best work, both would come with Leone's next film in my view. Yet it would be ridiculous to argue that this was not their most iconic cinematic offering.

The \"dollar trilogy\" (1964 - 1966) of which \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" is the last one and The \"Once upon a time trilogy\" (1968 - 1984) of which \"Once upon a time in the West\" was the first one.Technically speaking a spaghetti Western is a Western made by a non American director (often an Italian), shot on a non American location (often Spain) with not to expensive American actors (often at the beginning or the end of their career). More interesting however are the substantive differences. I shall discuss three differences, all of which are also to be found in \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\".In the first place the role of the American history c.q the images about nation building in the storyline are far less prominent in the spaghetti Western. In spaghetti Westerns no native Americans or trail to the West. In \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" there are rather South American influences. The Ugly (Tuco played by Eli Wallach) is a Mexican and The Good (Blondie played by Clint Eastwood) dresses like a Southerner (poncho). The American civil war is no more then a coatrack for the rather minimalistic plot about treasure hunting.In the second place the view of the world is far more cynical and pessimistic. In spaghetti Westerns no good guys against bad guys. Despite the title the three main characters in \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" are bad, even more bad and also bad.Last but certainly not least the design of the movie. Sergio Leone liked long takes going all the way from panorama shots to (extreme) close ups. In the famous shootout at the end of the movie he takes this preference to the extreme.Just like Eisenstein he liked weathered faces and for the supporting roles he used no professional extra's (as Hollywood would do) but local farmers. Leone also liked minimal dialogue, gaining space for the iconic music off Ennio Morricone.For a long time \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" stand in the shadow of \"Once upon a time in the West\". The last years times are changing and on IMDB \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" has in the mean time the higher rating. For wat it is worth, \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" at least has more humor. The Good and the Ugly together form a duo vaguely reminiscent of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza. The Tuco of Eli Wallach is a jester like figure that plays for a fool but in reality he is not. For this character Sergo Leone had however to set aside his preference for minimal dialogue.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Probably the best shootout in the history off the (spaghetti) Western", "date": "2021-07-17T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7135219", "sentiment score": [0.0487, 0.1717, 0.2888, 0.37, 0.1207]}, {"content": "Don't like it, didn't watch it, will never watch it !!Thank you.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 5}, "heading": "This movie is UGLY!!!", "date": "2021-07-03T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7086245", "sentiment score": [0.8387, 0.1497, 0.0105, 0.0006, 0.0006]}, {"content": "Before I see two dollars movies after I see this movie.

The Italian western was often thought to be a parody in itself, and Leone just happened to be the most skilful of those western making Italians. Today even people who are unfamiliar with the western genre know his name. He is considered by many as the greatest director of western movies in history, eclipsing even the names of a Ford or a Peckinpah. His movie The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is on top of most people's lists with favourite westerns, and Quentin Tarantino has called it the best directed movie of all time. The title has been referred to in fashion, construction, baseball, politics, pop music and God knows what more. Ennio Morricone's theme music has been used (and misused) so often, that it has become instantly recognisable to people of all ages in all corners of the world.# Looking for the UglyAccording to Dario Argento, who interviewed him at the time for an Italian newspaper, Sergio Leone had several films in mind after completing the second dollar movie, among them a biopic about Calamity Jane and Wild Bill Hickock (with Sophia Loren as Calamity Jane) a remake of Viva Villa! (a romanticized biopic of Pancho Villa), and an adventure movie set in war times. Some think The Good, the Bad and the Ugly originated in combining ideas for the remake and the adventure movie set in wartime. Leone wasn't really fascinated by the Mexican revolution (unlike some of his colleagues), nor in the historic figure of Pancho Villa, but had been impressed by Wallace Beery, who had portrayed the revolutionary as the typical, ebullient Latin character. He wanted to keep the character, but use it within a different context. The background for his movie, wouldn't be the Mexican Revolution, but the American Civil War, his main character not an altruist who was concerned with the destiny of his people, but a good-for-nothing who tried to survive in war time by using the hostilities to his own advantage.Leone's original choice for this 'ugly character' was Gian Maria Volont\u00e9, but he was afraid the character would become a neuropath when played by Volont\u00e9, and that was not what he had in mind. But then he saw Eli Wallach (some say in How the West was Won, others say in The Magnificent Seven) and all of a sudden he knew he had found the right actor: a dramatic actor with a natural talent for comedy, who reminded him of both Wallace Beery and Charlie Chaplin.The anchor pointThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly is the third and most ambitious part of Sergio Leone's so-called Dollar Trilogy, and also his third movie starring Clint Eastwood, the man who made himself a name by becoming the Man with No Name. Eastwood had been a cynical opportunist in A Fistful of Dollars and a bounty hunter in For a few a dollars More. In The Good, the Bad and the Ugly he's an opportunist again. In the triptych 'good-bad-ugly', he represents the good. But don't be fooled: like the opportunist and the bounty hunter from the previous two movies, the good is basically interested in money.In For a Few dollars More, No Name had appeared alongside a second protagonist, Colonel Mortimer, played by Lee Van Cleef, and the newcomer had stolen the movie away from the veteran. Now a third character was added, and again this newcomer would walk away with the movie. Eli Wallach's ambiguous character is the anchor point of the story, with two other characters, one good, one bad, contrasting with his 'ugly' nature. Neither of them was to be defined in traditional terms of morality. Blondie is only 'good' because he isn't as ugly as Tuco, and Tuco is only 'ugly' because he isn't as bad as Angel Eyes. But all three are rather merciless opportunists, ready to kill if necessary, and 'villains' in the traditional good/bad polarisation of the western movie. Leone wanted to demystify the adjectives, and at the same time show the absurdity of war. He was, in his own words, pursuing a theme Chaplin had exposed in Monsieur Verdoux, a study of a 20th century Bluebeard, operating on the eve of WW II, who confuses the people who have sentenced him to death with questions about the true meanings of good and bad.The PlotThe plot is relatively simple. Tuco, a Mexican outlaw, teams up with Blondie, an American bounty hunter. The American will turn the Mexican in, collect the reward money, but rescue him from hanging by shooting through the rope. As a couple of illusionists, they travel from town to town, repeating the same trick everywhere. Angel Eyes, on the other hand, is a hired gun who is looking for a Confederate soldier named Bill Carson, who knows of the whereabouts of a load of gold. The two stories intertwine when Tuco, who was double-crossed by Blondie, leads his former partner into the desert to kill him. They meet a moribund Bill Carson, who tells them about the gold, hidden on a cemetery: to Tuco he tells the name of the cemetery, to Blondie the name on the grave. The two dress up like Confederate soldiers, but they're captured by the Union and brought to a prison camp. Tuco has taken the identity of Bill Carson, and attracts the attention of Angel Eyes, who works in the camp as a sergeant. After a long series of incidents, with endless double-crossings and changing alliances, the three men arrive at the cemetery ...Ecstasy on the Altar of DeathThe Good, the Bad and the Ugly is an assured work, made by a film maker at the peak of his art. The movie has been called a comical nightmare as well as a study of the horrors of war. It is deeply rooted in the tradition of the picaresque novel and the commedia dell'arte, two Latin literary traditions. The picaresque story of three adventurers chasing the same treasure is punctuated by brief but poignant images of the war. We catch glimpses of executions, humiliations and torture, and it all culminates in this protracted scene of the trench war at Langstone Bridge. The cruelty of the war also defines the morality of the movie, and the characters involved in it. The three men can be real bastards, but the war is shown as an inferno of destruction and pain. Ironically the war also intervenes to save lives: a mysterious Confederate death wagon appears from nowhere when Tuco is about to kill Blondie, a mortar shell breaks the beam from which Blondie is about to be hanged, etc. This is the true absurdity of the war, and of life. Blowing up the bridge, basically a selfish act (\"If those idiots stop fighting, we can cross the river\"), also becomes an act of mercy: thanks to Blondie and Tuco the sympathetic Union officer, the 'philosopher' of the movie, can rest in peace. This idea of life by destruction, is mirrored in the famous 'ecstasy of gold' scene, with a greedy and ecstatic Tuco running in circles, looking for a name that can change his life in the midst of this altar of death, the cemetery called Sad Hill.ConclusionFunny, violent and meaningful, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is probably as close to perfection as a film can get. A few jokes may be a bit insipid and I don't really like this shootout in a ghost town between Tuco and Blondie and Angel Eyes' men. There are also a few problems in regard to Angel Eyes' character: his appearance in a Northern POW camp is a bit suspicious (how did he get there, and how on earth did he become a sergeant in no time?). But some scenes, like the triello, the Mexican Standoff on the cemetery, and the ecstasy of gold, Tuco's run around the graves of Sad Hill, belong to the most beautiful ever filmed. The Langstone Bridge sequence is almost a movie within a movie. Morricone's score is one of the best of his impressive career.

Directed by Sergio Leone, I fondly remembered watching it during Christmas, just before my fourteenth birthday. I saw it back then as essentially a Western Comic Book set to opera music, featuring violent men posturing themselves as cool and macho while communicating with each other through a language of cruelty and sadism. The other reviewers are correct when they see this as a deconstruction of The Myth of the West. You could say this film is the flip side of HOW THE WEST WAS WON (1962), and you would not be far from right.Produced by Alberto Grimaldi, this movie offers an impressive array of production values and is the culmination of The Man With No Name chronicles. These stories began with A FIST FULL OF DOLLARS (1964), followed by FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE (1965), and this piece of cinema rounds out the trilogy. These films appealed to my adolescent sensibilities at the time, when the best take I had on being a man involved appearing stony faced and talking tough while spewing profanities and smoking cigars. Each one of The Man With No Name films seemed to me to be better than the last, with director Leone learning and perfecting his craft as he went along. You could say it was like the craze over the musclemen movies and bodybuilding, a celebration of form over function and style over substance.But there is a curious substance to this Italian romance with the aesthetics of John Ford and Akira Kurosawa, dovetailing as it does with the cultural breakdown of America due to its own legacy of shortcomings. It is hard to put your finger on that precise point when being good and virtuous began to be associated with being weak and submissive; and innocence related to a kind of naivete' that told of the uninitiated who possessed no knowledge of the way things really work. But this is a pardigm shift that really did happen in my time. The Man With No Name was no Hopalong Cassady prancing his horse down the spilling, splashing waters cascading over stone steps. He was no clean cut, grinning exemplar of the Male Ethic with a song in his heart. No, he was a dirty, crude drifter with a three day growth for a beard and a lightning draw, who always kept his cards close to his vest.This strange hybrid of Zen confrontations and closeups along with vista embracing long shots basted with the Italian macho that so influenced noir ganster films, was a new creature of its own. Gone were the fist fights of Roy Rodgers and Gene Autrey to settle affairs. Clint Eastwood would whip out his Colt to shoot first and ask no questions later. As The Man With No Name, he was the apex of a triangle of mercenaries who were in it for the gold and possessed no qualms about getting rid of the competition. Lee Van Cleef is spellbinding as Sentenza Aka 'Angel Eyes', the hit man with the heart of a Black Hole, and Eli Wallach proves to be the true emotional heart of the tale as Tuco Benedicto Pac\u00edfico Juan Mar\u00eda Ram\u00edrez, a raging, effusive, impulsive bandit guilty of many crimes. You could call this film a glorification of the criminal element. What with its confidence man always holding something in reserve, along with its marauding bandit and its contract killer always on the lookout for the next greedy opportunity. But that would be taking this epic far too seriously and might cause you to miss out on all the fun.This is the American Western looked at through the European perspective with loving regard. Oddly enough, its greatness is to found in what is lost in the translation as it is re-imagined by Leone and composer Ennio Morricone in terms of putting the accent on 'opera', as in Horse Opera. In some respects, it is an examination of how The Western can be made to reflect the European experience rather than the other way around. There is a torture scene in this movie that seems to presage the aestheticizing of violence later to be found in Gibson's THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST (2004). Nor is there any getting around the fact that this last entry in The Man With No Name Trilogy is about the triumph of greed over death. Indeed, the runway horse-drawn hospital ambulance racing through the desert without a driver, and filled with several dead confederate soldiers, made me recall the painting by Pieter Brueghel (c. 1520-69) entitled The Triumph of Death. These are heady waters to plunge into with three characters who represent anything but the Father, the Son and the Holy Ghost. But the meticulously choreographed gunfights set to stirring and haunting music and witty musical phrases, along with Tuco's frenzied dance through the cemetery for The Ecstasy of Gold, lead to such a cool Mexican standoff that we chuckle away from the thought that The Man With No Name might just be Death himself.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Where have you gone Hopalong Cassady?", "date": "2021-05-07T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6887121", "sentiment score": [0.0062, 0.0116, 0.039, 0.3534, 0.5899]}, {"content": "Watch this film once and it will leave a lasting impression on you. Watch it a few times more and it will be indelibly imprinted on your soul forever! Such is the power of cinema when it is harnessed in such an incredible way. Pretty much everything has already been said about this film by previous reviewers so I won't rehash it all. However, just 10 seconds or so of one scene - the final three way gunfight(The trio) - sums it up for me: Blondie is already waiting, gun at the ready in the middle, Angel Eyes slowly struts like a peacock towards him.

'\"The good, the ugly, the bad\"').\nFirst, I would like to stress out the movie setting and its history. In the 1960's Western movies were becoming very popular, the Hollywood Westerns included heroes that were often well groomed, had nice clothing, had charismatic voices and shiny new guns, often times very good gunslingers that fought the bad guys and always won. The Spaghetti Western on the other hand was usually a low budget movie recorded in Italy, most often in Sicily, hence the name. Spaghetti Westerns were usually very violent and included not heroes but anti-heroes who usually worked for their own personal gain, this made the movies appear way more realistic. It is also noteworthy to say that that the music in the Hollywood Westerns was much simpler, chilling and relaxing, the music of the Spaghetti Westerns was almost always really energetic, took a lot of effort and increased in tone and frequency as the time went by. The last thing I would like to add is that we often think that the US Civil war was an entirely moral war, with the North being the good guys and the south the bad ones but even though most Hollywood Westerns' timeline happened in 1860's, the US Civil War was almost entirely ignored, this is contrasted by the Spaghetti Westerns who saw the neither side as good, they would show that both sides were bleeding each other dry and both sides committed atrocities, denying the enemy basic human rights. In this movie we find 3 main characters, the \"Good\", we do not know his name but he is often called \"Blondie\" by the \"Ugly\" who's known as \"Tuco\". The third character, \"The Bad\" is known by his alias \"Angel Eyes\". All of these 3 characters are excellent gunslingers and have 1 goal in life; personal gain. All the characters interact with each other in the movie, sometimes working together and sometimes trying to kill each other, often times by outwitting instead of using blunt force. The characters in the movie often don't use too much dialogue, but say more by saying less thus stressing out the important part. Lastly, I would like to talk about this movie's scenography and music. The music was mostly composed by 1 man; Ennio Morricone. The music rarely overlaps with the dialogue, which leaves the viewer to listen to what the characters say better. The director and the music artist had a talent of working together, there are scenes in the movie where the music is used primarily to build up tension and to incite action, for this reason the music is only used when the characters are or are acting silent for example: when characters are sneaking or are under threat.\nOverall, the movie is widely recognised as a masterpiece and I agree, every single moment is either deeply embedded to the storyline or is action based, one can start watching this movie from any timeline and still find it interesting. For all these unique factors the movie offers I can do nothing but recommend it for everyone to watch.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 4, "votes": 6}, "heading": "infinite/10, Please watch it", "date": "2021-01-24T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6521633", "sentiment score": [0.0121, 0.0429, 0.0983, 0.5517, 0.295]}, {"content": "One of the greatest films ever made, Sergio Leone's best and in my opinion the greatest western ever made.

The Good, The Bad and the Ugly (GBU), is the most famous of the Spaghetti Westerns, however, the Spaghetti Western was around a little bit before the release of GBU. The term basically describes Western films, based on American history, that were made in Europe, most notably Italy and Spain. Some also were made in Mexico and they all came out in the theaters in the 60s & 70s. It is actually a critical term that American critics coined in the 60s, making fun of these films, because America was so used to the TV westerns that filled the airwaves. But, as time moved forward, the term became acceptable, as well as, the movies themselves. It turned into a positive term, because these films were really good, but a little too different for some. These films now have achieved critical acclaim today, long after their release.GBU is the third film in a series known as \"The Man with No Name\" trilogy, directed by legendary, Italian film director, Sergio Leone. The musical score was done by master film composer, Ennio Morricone. He would later go on to do the score for Brian De Palma's Untouchables (1987), another great movie and favorite of mine.GBU is that classic story about three completely different guys, the good one (Clint), the bad one (Van Cleef) and the ugly one (Wallach). It has a wonderful collection of colorful, interesting supporting characters that help propel this film to its exciting end. Its so well, craftily done that you don't even notice the basic, simple plot of three outlaws, in the ultimate struggle to see, who can find the gold from a heist that was hidden away. This also helps to bring forward the time period that the film wants to establish, being as the gold was stolen from a Confederate stash during the Civil War. Eastwood and Wallach's characters get intertwined with each other, while Van Cleef's, Angel Eyes, always is looking for an opportunity to kill them both. It's a great story.Eli Wallach almost killed himself a couple times in this film. Issues with stunts and poor safety measures almost did some of the work for Angel Eyes. Eli Wallach is brilliant and funny in this film too. This is Clint Eastwood at his best. Clint's character also influenced Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox), in Back to the Future III (1990). Having mixed language-speaking actors also complicated matters. Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach all spoke English, but most of the rest of the cast was Italian or Spanish, hence the need for dubbing. Sergio Leone spoke hardly any English, so he and Wallach communicated by speaking French to each other and the others had interpreters.Charles Bronson was originally chosen to be in Lee Van Cleef's \"Bad\" roll, but declined to be in the film. There is no dialogue in the first eleven minutes of the film, but who cares. GBU's strongest link is its dreamy-like imagery mixed in with amazing, mesmerizing music. This is what film is all about and this is the definitive Western.9.4 (A MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 3}, "heading": "A good one to watch on January 9th, Lee Van Cleef's birthday", "date": "2021-01-14T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6473737", "sentiment score": [0.0166, 0.1169, 0.3746, 0.406, 0.0859]}, {"content": "For a movie with so much hype it took so long to get through and frankly I really don't care about any of the characters what so ever I never thought that they were gonna die because I say the 3 hour run time and the one scene he might die is only 2 hours in", "rating": 5, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 17}, "heading": "Every scene was about 5 minutes too long", "date": "2021-01-10T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6460440", "sentiment score": [0.4402, 0.3512, 0.0956, 0.0493, 0.0637]}, {"content": "I watch western movies just to get a glimpse of this movie, I love this movie, my mobile ringtone is still the same movie, I have watched it again and again", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 5, "votes": 6}, "heading": "All time best movie", "date": "2021-01-07T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6451272", "sentiment score": [0.0029, 0.0027, 0.0158, 0.134, 0.8446]}, {"content": "Sergio Leone proves yet again that he's the master of cinematography and the western genre. The film is so brilliant in setting up the tone and themes, slipping seamlessly from comedy to tragedy to violent passion and back to comedy again. Every character is designed to perfection, even the little characters who have but minutes of screen time are all interesting and very unique.Cinematography is spot on, with vast panning shots of the western land and also encompasses frequent but well placed close ups of character's faces so as to better read their emotions (or presumed lack of) and dominate the screen. Furthermore, in some shots what the camera cannot see the characters cannot see, and that gives Leone the freedom to surprise us with character entrances (Tuco surprised Blondie for example) that cannot be explained by the normal geography of shots.The music by Ennio Morricone is absolutely superb and can be both subtle and obvious to drive a scene and enhance the action. The sharp jab of music when the evil Angel Eyes first rides into frame leads to a certain level of unease that cannot be explained any other way apart from the music. Music that has long become legendary and iconic, rightfully so.The acting is breath-taking, Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach, Lee Van Cleef and every single supporting actor (reluctant to use supporting considering how great the roles are) are perfect.10/10: You cannot dislike this film, and if you do you're just plain wrong in my eyes", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 4}, "heading": "An extraordinarily fantastic western", "date": "2020-12-31T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6428419", "sentiment score": [0.0201, 0.071, 0.1347, 0.4033, 0.3708]}, {"content": "I gotta say I've never wrote a review for any 60's movie but this one had to have one.

The three central characters try the story and are the main focus.I'll start with the best actor and one of my favorite characters, Tuco. When I first saw the film Clint Eastwood was my drawing point but as the movie progressed I fell in love with Tuco. He is conflicted in life as he lives a life of crime and greed and yet you can tell there is some part of him deep inside that actually might care for people. He's also one of the few characters who truly changes through the film and learns a lesson.\nThe second is Blondie or The man with no name or Clint Eastwood.

I could keep typing about it but the only way to truly see what I mean is to watch the film for yourself.\nI should also talk about the soundtrack.

It's an epic story of adventure, war, murder and betrayal set in the wild west, with a score by Ennio Morricone that became literally legendary over the years. It follows three cowboys in Civil War Era America all looking for buried treasure worth an estimated $17 million in today's currency.\nThis is one of these movies which I had in my watchlist for about 5 years, you just keep postponing it because from what you've heard it should be incredibly good, and that brings certain pressure for a person like me, who tries to analyze films. I have seen a couple of classical Westerns before (The Magnificent Seven; OUATI the West), so I had certain expectations for this film. I was happy that the film turned out to be not at all what I expected, in all the good ways.\nI don't want to say that this is the only Western you ever have to watch in your life; but from what I can tell this is like Michelangelo's \"David\" in the world of Westerns; if you do end up seeing only the one, you will get a good idea of what the whole genre has to offer, because that there - is the finest of the finest.\nPeople often say that the director Sergio Leone (OIATI the West; OUATI America) redefined the Western genre with this film. The so-called \"spaghetti Westerns\" (cowboy movies produced and directed by Italians in the 60-70s) were so profitable and popular at the time, that they soon became virtually the same story copy-pasted over and over again (kinda like some Marvel films nowadays). If the recipe works, why change it, right? That led to the inevitable decline and foreseeable death of Westerns as a genre, but Sergio Leone had one last word to fit into this story.\nWhat differentiates \"The Good...\" from other Westerns of it's era is the accurate representations of it's characters and War. The three rogue characters, apart from being traditionally \"cool and extremely skilled loners\", a reoccurring image we still see in today's Mandalorian and Witcher, are insanely well-developed. Each has short but extremely impactful scenes that show the essence of the character, explaining their motivation and, sometimes, background. They are brutal, murdering for the sake of murder and betraying for the sake of personal gain; but they are also lovable and unforgettable, and after all, this is the Wild West.\nThe other thing about War is a reoccurring theme in all of my reviews on war films. You can't call this one a war film, but Leone makes his characters go through the battlefields of the ongoing warfare on their quest for a hidden treasure, and that gives the film a life-contemplating dramatic twist. War is not shown as cool, it is shown for what it really is: \"a daily slaughter\" and a terrible, unnecessary waist of good men. The first time I've seen War viewed like this in an old movie, it was a pleasant surprise. The film is also widely considered cinematically perfect, and although it didn't occur to me first, I must agree on that. Leone embraces the cinematic elements of filmmaking; he carefully composes each widescreen like he's painting a great landscape; and the extreme eye-level close-ups have become his trademark.\nJust like with most of other great \"top-rated\" movies, \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\" had an undeniably profound effect on cinema and our collective thinking. Antiheroes is a common trait in modern films, and the final Mexican standoff scene has become deeply ingrained in our culture and became one of the most parodied scenes in motion picture history.

This is the movie that made me interested in movies in the first place, and to this day I've not been able to find a movie that resonnates better with me. I'm astonished how well this movie holds up, even after 50 years, and it's almost a bit depressing when you think about how unappreciated it was at the time of its release. Fortunately, it has since then gained more recognition, and is widely regared as one of the greatest movies ever made, and in my opinion, the single best movie ever made.From the opening credits you know you're about to watch something special. The iconic theme combined with the visuals that tell their own tale make for arguably one of the most entertaining opening credits. Then, we're immediately thrown into the action, as three bounty hunters try to hunt down Tuco, The Ugly, after a tense scene where they walk towards each other, leading you to believe that a duel between them is about to commence.. Speaking of which, Tucos introduction is practically perfect. In just one shot, we know almost everything there is to know about the character, by looking at his expression and the things he carries in his hands. Angel Eyes's (The Bad) and Blondie's (The Good) introductions are also incredibly good, quickly establishing the nature of the characters and how we will come to view them throughout the movie.One of the things one must keep in mind when watching this movie, is that Sergio Leone prioritizes the individual scene instead of an intricately crafted story. What this results in is that EVERY SINGLE SCENE is a work of art, complete with suspense, it's own pacing and most important of all: the gorgeous cinematography that defines this movie. This means that every scene in this movie is iconic in some way, and it is in my opinion the movie's greatest strength.The characters in this movie are very cleverly constructed in my opinion, and while I can understand people complaining about some being bland, I think they work perfectly for this movie. Blondies backstory is left ambigous, though one can't help but wonder what other adventures he has been on. He isn't very outspoken, and this gives him that iconic feeling of mysteriousness. Tuco IS given a rich backstory, expressed both in his conversation with his brother and his hanging scene at the beginning, where the sheriff lists up everything he has done. He's by far the most entertaining character in the movie, constantly talking and goofing around. Then there's Angel Eyes, which similar to Blondie doesn't have a backstory, but his tenacity and charisma as the ultimate villain more than makes up for it. The side characters are also generally very good, even though they rarely get more than one scene.The themes of this movie generally revolves around morality and greed, and I love how it's not shoved in your face with unnecessary dialogue, but rather subtly shown through how the characters approach different situations. I also like how the three main characters are very similar in the beginning, but start to show their differences once they experience more and more of the Civil War and its cruelties. Angel Eyes, being truly evil, uses it for profit and to satisfy his need for violence and money. Tuco's approach is similar , but he doesn't have the charisma needed to benefit of the war, and so chooses a more pacifistic way of dealing with it. The difference is clearest with blondie, who start the movie as an immoral bounty hunter, but through seeing the cruel reality of the war he becomes a more merciful man, which culminates in how he spares Tuco's life at the very end, despite everything Tuco did to him.If there has ever been a movie in which the director and composer has worked together in perfect harmony, this is it. As opposed to regular movies, Leone and Morricone sat down before filming to create the themes, before adjusting the actual shots to the music. This is in my opinion the movie where Morricone transformed into a composer god. Every theme is perfect, from the iconic main theme, to The Story of a Soldier, to The Ecstasy of Gold and The Trio. The music and action blends together perfectly to the point that the movie becomes an entirely different one without the score.It's time to talk about the finale, the climax, the peak of tension. The entire movie has been building up to this: Tuco arrives at the cementary, and for 4 minutes the only thing happening is him looking for the grave he believes the 200.000 dollars in gold is buried. This scene is carried entirely by the score, the iconic Ecstasy of Gold theme. Then Blondie and Angel Eyes show up to the cementary. As it's revealed that Tuco's information about the spesific grave is false, they realize that only Blondie knows which grave it's buried in, and so begins the single best climactic showoff in ANY movie. Three men, all exceptionally skilled with their guns, stands in a circle, and for 5 minutes the only thing moving is the score, Morricone's The Trio, which builds suspense as it rises in power and greatness. There is no dialogue, yet the facial expressions and the editing still tells a compelling story in which the characters all try to figure out who will shoot first. As the music suddenly stops, Angel Eyes draws, only for Blondie to shoot him first, but only to injure. As Angel Eyes attempts to shoot Blondie again, he is shot and killed, and so ends the story of The Bad. Tuco and Blondie then digs up the gold, and we get a final showcase of Blondie's character arc: after ordering Tuco to put his head in a noose and riding off, he reappears and severs the rope, leaving Tuco alive. Then he rides away, The Good, The Man with no Name, to the iconic theme that introduced the movie in the first place.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "My favorite movie of all time", "date": "2020-10-28T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6213185", "sentiment score": [0.0152, 0.0619, 0.1193, 0.3751, 0.4285]}, {"content": "Maybe or maybe not\nFifty years ago I would enjoy it...", "rating": 1, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 4, "votes": 59}, "heading": "Booooring", "date": "2020-10-20T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6192496", "sentiment score": [0.0397, 0.1395, 0.4238, 0.3153, 0.0817]}, {"content": "The Good kill by 11 person . the ugly killed 6 people. the bad, killed 3 person", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 2}, "heading": "interesting information", "date": "2020-10-15T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6177710", "sentiment score": [0.5497, 0.2165, 0.1441, 0.0552, 0.0345]}, {"content": "It's one of the best westerns I've seen.\nThe acting, the plans, the music, the story, all this makes the beauty of this film.\nIt's always a pleasure to see it and see it again.\nEli Wallach is excellent and funny, Clint Eastwood a unique actor.\nWhat can we say except that this film is a masterpiece, too bad we don't do more like that!!", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "A masterpiece", "date": "2020-10-12T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6169091", "sentiment score": [0.002, 0.0035, 0.0129, 0.1085, 0.873]}, {"content": "Pros:\n1.

It takes its time to deliver the story and actually makes their quest for gold feel like a quest.This movie should be banned from remakes.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 2}, "heading": "we SCORED a classic (see what I did there)", "date": "2020-10-05T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6149040", "sentiment score": [0.0296, 0.1006, 0.2297, 0.4384, 0.2016]}, {"content": "Sergio Leone's 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' (1966) is the third and final film in the 'Dollar' trilogy. The film's two predecessors are 'A Fistful of Dollars' (1964) and 'For a Few Dollars More' (1965).\n'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' (1966) is a very popular Western about... you know what? I won't even summarize the plot for you. Everybody needs to watch this classic by going in completely blind!Let me talk about our 3 main actors.\nThe \"Good\": Clint Eastwood plays \"Blondie\", a professional gunslinger trying to earn a few dollars.\nThe \"Bad\": Lee Van Cleef plays the hitman \"Angel Eyes\" who doesn't mind going the dirty route when it comes to making money.\nThe \"Ugly\": Eli Wallach plays Tuco who is a wanted outlaw.\nAll 3 men have very different personalities, yet they share a common goal: making a ton of money!Before I start talking about the specifics, I would like to clarify that my expectations for this film were enormous! I was expecting a specific type of Western and I got something else. Keep that in mind as you read my review. Of course I will rewatch the film and if my thoughts change in any significant shape or form, I will let you know with an update.As someone who is a huge fan of 'For a Few Dollars More' (and literally calls it their favorite Western of all time), it was especially hard for me to accept seeing Lee Van Cleef play the bad guy. Having said that, he did a wonderful job as the villain of the story!Eli Wallach did a really good job at capturing the behavior of someone who is desperate for money as well as revenge! He is a very unpredictable character since you never know what he is going to do next!Finally our great Western hero Clint Eastwood who is charismatic as always and seeing him smoke a cigar has still not worn off one bit!This is a film that will NEVER get old! It will always prevail through the test of time! I really cannot see people ever discrediting it!'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' might just be the most complex Western in history! The thing about this film that really threw me off guard was that it isn't your traditional Western film (which I was expecting), but instead it goes the extra mile and gives us a little history lesson for the time of the 'Civil War'!At times, I did think that a few of the scenes were a tad bit long, but nothing too major. The most important thing is that I never got bored and instead my eyes were glued onto the screen in anticipation of what would happen next!I find it absolutely fascinating how this 3-hour-epic has managed to keep my attention at its highest level for such a long time! Rarely any movie can do that! But this isn't like any other movie, this is a really special one!I would obviously be remissed if I didn't at least mention the unbelievably genius climax (the final 25 minutes of the film)! Everything that happens during that climax is pure perfection! The music, the cinematography, the acting, the stakes, the insane level of tension!Speaking of the music, Ennio Morricone perhaps gave us the greatest soundtrack he ever created! There are so many jaw-dropping musical moments in there that clearly dominate on-screen and Leone lets the music shine in its pure and sheer excellence! Morricone has the ability to make you feel uplifted, motivated or to make you feel really unsettled! There is a reason why I consider him one of the best musical composers, arguably the best, in history! His music will always live on forever in the same way that Leone's movies will forever be relevant!I also find it really interesting that, out of all 3 'Dollar' movies, 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' is the most emotional film! I genuinely love how the audience has NO IDEA what will happen next. This film is completely unpredictable! Sure, you can take a guess at what might happen and you might even get lucky, but you do not see these things coming from a mile away like with a lot of other movies!Overall, 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' was a real game changer in the entire film industry. Leone proved the world that you don't need to be an American or be a Hollywood director to make a great film! You can make a great film from no matter where you are in the world!\nThis film is long, yet well-paced, complex, yet comprehensible! It is rewatchable, iconic, beautiful and strong!

There is buried money. Three men pursue it. One man has power, and each of the other two has half of the information about where it is buried. The problem is all three are proud, arrogant, and the least cooperative in different ways.Blondie is quiet, confident, and shrewd. Angel Eyes is sadistic, cold-blooded, and oppressive. The two men make a typical combination of a protagonist and an antagonist. What makes this film special is the third man Tuco.Tuco is like comic relief. He quickly changes his attitude. When feeling threatened by someone, he pretends to be friendly and tries to appease him. Once the threat ends, all of a sudden he becomes aggressive and tries to take advantage. When he helps someone, we can't tell whether he is genuinely kind, or just tries to exploit the situation. Probably he can't tell himself either. He is the one who makes this at first glance simple plot unexpected.It's partly a war film, set in the Civil War. Why Angel Eyes is the Bad is he is not just an outlaw, but he also covers his crimes under military authority as a sergeant. It is interesting that the fantastic Western film has realistic war scenes. When watching the battlefield, even Blondie blurts out \"I've never seen so many men wasted so badly\".Every scene is not just explanatory but always compelling in some way. And the direction is excellent. Some scenes are only character's close-up shots combined with wonderful music, which is overwhelmingly powerful. Eastwood is of course a total badass.

And that word is \"transcendent\". This movie is not only the pinnacle of the Spaghetti Western, but it transcended into the pinnacle of the Western genre in itself. It's safe to say it transcends that too, and can be considered one of the greatest pieces of filmmaking ever. It counts with memorable performances by three different leads, a story that breaks the \"black and white\" concepts of morale, and an original score that can only be defined by \"epic\".Directed by the man responsible for the revitalization of the western in Italy, Sergio Leone, the film does an incredible job of introducing every character, and showing each and every one has a dubious concept of moral values. \"The Bad\", Sentenza, or Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), is shown to be a ruthless, greedy gun for hire, but also someone who lives by the mantra of always getting the job done. \"The Ugly\", Tuco, is a greedy backstabber, but he is also a man who comes from an extremely poor environment and family conflicts, showing a bit of determinism in the film. \"The Good\", Blondie (Clint Eastwood) is not much better himself. While he is surely the less greedy one, he also has no problem with killing and backstabbing other people. To put it in perspective, he is ironically announced as \"The Good\" right after abandoning a man to die in the desert.\nThe story follows all these three personalities as they engage in their particular gold rush: a buried treasure that is hidden in a cemetery. In order to find it, they must form an uneasy alliance, while trying to outrun each other, and claim the prized gold alone. All of this while the Civil War happens around them.\nThe performances are nothing short of amazing. It goes to show the range that Lee Van Cleef had once this villainous role is compared to his work in the previous installment of the trilogy, For a Few Dollars More, as a heroic, friendly and almost fatherly figure. His presence is as intimidating as ever, and one of the best he has given in his lengthy career. Eastwood is as eye-catching as one would expect: his deep stares and lines delivered in a whispery, yet gravelly voice, defined The Man With No Name. But the best of the bunch has to be Eli Wallach. His comedic timing is as precise as any bullet shot in this film. But the most outstanding part of his characterization is that while he is extremely funny, he also manages to be a credible threat for the \"hero\", Blondie.The original music score for this film deserves a whole book just to talk about it, and it still wouldn't do it justice. It's simply a lesson by the maestro, Ennio Morricone, on how music can change a film. Thanks to a track such as L'estasi dell'oro (The Ecstasy of Gold), a man running around a cemetery becomes one of the most epic scenes ever made. Thanks to a composition such as Il Triello, three men staring at each other, pondering their options for seven minutes straight, becomes tense enough to have the viewer on the edge of its seat. There is simply no other way to put it: Morricone crafted one of the best scores in this art's history.At the end of the day, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is more than just a great western film. It's a show of great acting, writing, directing and music scoring. It's a real once in a lifetime classic, that has been around for a long time, and not aged a little bit, and will still be talked about for generations of cinephiles to come.

Lee Van Cleef. Eli Wallach. Sad Hill Cemetery. Hidden Gold. With these five elements, Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone build what for many of us is the best ending in Seventh Art history. But before talking about the ending, it is essential that we review the events that have led us to such a situation and, what is even more important, the characters who, in one way or another, are predestined to face each other. On the one hand, we have Tuco, played by Eli Wallach, who is probably the character that viewers will most easily sympathize with. His motivation is simple: making money, and he has no problem about crawling on the floor or being humiliated to get it. Sergio Leone is in charge of constantly emphasizing these personal traits, summarized in the following sentence: where we were born, in order not to die of hunger, we had to choose, be a priest or a bandit. Next to him, we have Blondie, played by Clint Eastwood. No one doubts that his main motivation is to earn money, but it is undeniable that he is a character with greater pride, it means that he is not willing to take the money if he must kneel for it. He is a cold, calculating and intelligent character, and those adjectives are also useful when talking about Sentenza, played by Lee Van Cleef, who is not much different from Rubio, but with an even more evil and perverse background. The construction of characters throughout the film is simply wonderful, the picture shows us different scenes and situations in which we can draw conclusions about the behavior of each of the protagonists. The photography follows a very similar style to that of Leone's other films, with its characteristic zooms to the faces of the characters, which somehow help us to understand the emotions they express even more easily. Leone is also capable of managing the narrative tempo and tightening the dramatic chord in certain scenes, without forgetting that we are watching a Spaghetti Western and that, by definition, it should be entertaining for the viewer. The soundtrack should not even be commented, because Ennio Morricone once again creates one of those soundtracks that remain in the public's head for centuries, being part of popular culture and representing an entire cinematographic genre such as the Spaghetti Western. However, and although it is undeniable that the first two hours and twenty minutes of the film are of impressive quality, it is the last twenty minutes that make it one of the greatest classics in Seventh Art history. The ending is so good that we don't have to talk deeply about technical topics to understand and analyze its greatness, I think it seems unfair to have to talk about photography, editing, performances, music, etc. when talking about this ending. And the thing is, I truly believe that the magic of the ending is that, unlike in many other so charged with drama endings, the characters end up behaving as planned, just as the script has shown us throughout the film, being faithful to the script and, consequently, to the viewers. In that instant, you realized that The Good behaves as good fellows do, The Bad ends as bad guys end, and The Ugly ends up depending on the honor of good men. It is at that moment that Clint Eastwood looks at Eli Wallach and says: it seems just like old times. It is at that moment that you understand that everything fits, and then the music, photography and editing merge into a same element, and each character ends as the title of the picture suggests: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Seems Just Like Old Times", "date": "2020-09-14T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6095629", "sentiment score": [0.0106, 0.0427, 0.1662, 0.5675, 0.213]}, {"content": "*Cool and Menacing Gunslingers, Interesting Plot, Thought Provoking Scenerios, Stylistic Gunfights, Epic Music with Mexican Standoff and Treasure Hunt! - The Greatest Western Ever Made in the History of Cinema!*\"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\" is a 1966 Italian Epic Spaghetti Western Film Directed by Sergio Leone. Based on a Story by Luciano Vincenzoni and Sergio Leone. Starring Clint Eastwood as \"the Good\", Lee Van Cleef as \"the Bad\" and Eli Wallach as \"the Ugly\". Main theme of the Film is Greed. Also it has Cruelty, Violence, Anti War theme. And as the Story progresses, The line Between Good,Bad and Ugly becomes Blur and with some Gray shade the characters become More like Anti Heroes. Nobody is Totally Good or Bad or Ugly, maybe Lee Van Cleef's Character is Totally Bad but you get my Point. As Leone noted that Like many of his Films, this is also a Satire on Western Genre, more like Satire on Old West Romanticism. It shows the More Violent, More Complex Old West. It has been Called the Definitive Spaghetti Western.*The Plot revolves around Three Gunslingers, a Cynical and Confident Bounty Hunter only known as Blondie, a Ruthless, Sadistic Mercenary called Angel Eyes and a Fast-talking Cunning Mexican Bandit called Tuco. Set in 1862, During the American Civil War, the three of them Compete to Find Fortune in Gold Buried in a Cemetery. The Plot is very Simple. As the Story go Forward, They land in Many Difficult Situations and Gunfights. The Character Development of The Movie is Perfect.\nEvery Scenes of Tuco And Blondie is just Great and Funny. Some Scenes like Tuco meeting his Brother, Tuco buying Revolver, Angel Eyes torturing Tuco with the Music in the Background, Tuco and Blondie meets the Alcoholic union Captain in the ongoing war on the Bridge, The Mexican Standoff Between the Trio are just Epic. Every Scene and Dialogue of the Movie is Great and I Love Every bit of It. The Cinematography was great too with the use Of Classic Leone Long Shots and Close-up.*Sergio Leone is the Master of Western Films. By his Films, He expanded the Spaghetti western genre and Became an International Sensation. This film is The third of the \"Dollar Trilogy\" or also known as \"The Man with No Name Trilogy\", Starring Clint Eastwood as the Titular Hero. Although the Story is not Related in the Trilogy, the Films are - 1) A Fistful of Dollars 2) For a Few Dollars More 3) the Good,the Bad and the Ugly. I love the trilogy but This is my most Favorite films of All time. As I said Earlier, this is the Greatest western ever made, with \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" comes as close second, Another one of Sergio Leone. I also love his less Popular \"Duck, You Sucker\", it was a Great western too. American Westerns didn't come close to this, but \"The Magnificent Seven\", \"Stagecoach\", \"Rio Bravo\", \"High Noon\" were some Great Competitors.*The Actors - Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach did a Phenomenal Job. Nobody Will ever forget their Acting,Character after Watching the film. Clint Eastwood is the Most Stylish, Cool Western Hero Ever. His Mannerisms, Quiet Behavior, Menacing Look, Cigar-Smoking Gunslinger is Immortalized. Lee Van Cleef also Acted in Many westerns as Positive and Negative Characters, but this is the Most great Character He Ever Played. As everybody that saw the film, will Agree with me, that Eli Wallach stole the Show as Tuco! He also had the Most Scenes to work too and He nailed it Perfectly as the Comical but Cunning Bandit. The Supporting Casts did Great too, specially Aldo Giuffre as Alcoholic Union Captain, Mario Brega as Corporal Wallace, Luigi Pistilli as Father Pablo Ramirez.*The Music was composed by the Legend Ennio Morricone. So as a Result some Legendary Scores were Created. \"the Good, the Bad and the Ugly Main theme\", \"the Story of a Soldier\", \"the Ecstacy of Gold\" are just to name a Few. Every Background Score of this movie is Epic.*I am a Great Fan of the Western Genre and I think Everybody should Watch this Film. It's Old but It's an Epic Film.

There are of course a whole bunch of good titles that I have given a 9/10, and I will probably list those later on.So here we go, the 8 titles that I gave 10/10 are as follows: The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966), The Sopranos (1999-2007), Jaws (1975), The Shield (2002-2008), Seven Samurai (1954), The Shining (1980), Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964), and finally The Passion of the Christ (2004).The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. This is an adventure, with crazy characters, good music, a backdrop of civil war, and most of all a treasure hunt.I love the character development in this title, each of the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly have their own motivations, and mix in a whole load of grey area in between. I can't really explain it, but these three characters might be some of my favourites. I want to feel sorry for Tuco, but he's a wild animal. I want to root for the man with no name, but he is so ambiguous. I feel as if Segio Leone knew what he was doing in this regard, a commentary on the psychology of man and in particular the time period of the frontier west.The attention to detail is ahead of it's time I feel, the longshots, and the rapid editing in the showdowns. This has been copied and copied time and again, but Lerone did it first I feel. His camerawork and positioning are top notch.I love the backdrop, and I love the composition of music, scenery and atmosphere. This is masterful and well balanced. I'm almost certain he has encoded the 7 sins in this movie as well. Story wise the three main characters intertwine several times and end up on the same goal of finding the gold coins. I can't understand how well this plays out and the slow burn to the final showdown is just pure genius.

This film is a true masterpiece.The seemingly endless western landscapes, which Leone has captured in all of its grandeur, is filled with endless storytelling possiblities. Sergio Leone has shown that how can one exploit the situations to build characters and make a film, even a significantly large one like this, with a plot which seems not large enough to get 180 minutes on screen.The opening sequences of the film, the Civil War outbursts in between, Blondie and Tuco' s initial strife, all of these play vital part in character development. Even without too much of dialogues, we get to know about each one of them and their respective ways of operating, and this is the signature of a great film.The use of close ups and extreme close ups in the film is extremely evident, and coupled with great acting, they serve in building our understanding of the characters as well as creating some of the tension scenes, which the film is famous for. An hour into the film, and we know what does a stare from Blondie means.The film is set in the Civil War period. The sequences involving it add significant subtext to the film. The beating of the Ugly, the death of the Union captain (played by Aldo Giuffr\u00e8) are heart shaking. The beating sequence in particular looks very brutal rather than the cheesy and crafted. This wasn't a norm then.As for the music, hadn't it been Morricone's masterful score, this film wouldn't have felt the same way.

It has a cleverly written and easy to follow plot following three characters. The way the film follows these individuals and how their stories intertwine is quite interesting. There is a back and forth relationship between the characters and a, literally, long journey for all of them, specifically the 'Good' and the 'Ugly' characters. The action scenes are well executed and fairly exciting. Some of the cinematography and editing is top notch, the end scene specifically comes to mind. The score by Ennio Morricone is legendary and adds suspense and intrigue to a film that could otherwise suffer from slow pacing. Where the film falls a bit flat for me is the depth of the characters. The three title characters are actually not all that different, even though the title would suggest otherwise. While these characters do differ in style and personality, which does create some contrasts, their convictions and morals are quite clich\u00e9 (although maybe less so in the year the film was made) as they all want one thing and they are all willing to commit the same deeds to get there. Due to the lack of depth and sympathy in these characters this created a scenario where I did not really care what happened to any of them, or who won out in the eventual end to the tale. Having said this, the characters do very much compliment each other with the few subtle differences they have, specifically in personality; they all have their own unique charm, while sustaining a ruthlessness that is needed to succeed in the wild West...While having some downfalls, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is nonetheless a very good film and is well worth watching.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "A great Western, if Westerns are your thing...", "date": "2020-08-29T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6037158", "sentiment score": [0.0005, 0.0053, 0.1527, 0.8129, 0.0286]}, {"content": "Sergio Leone at his finest, maybe the best western ever made", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Simply EPIC", "date": "2020-08-28T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6033757", "sentiment score": [0.0041, 0.0057, 0.0268, 0.1582, 0.8053]}, {"content": "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is one of the most iconic movies ever made. Growing up I saw homages, parodies and references everywhere (mostly the music), and it was always got the reference even without seeing the movie until now. For a movie from 1966, it holds up extremely well.The movie centers around 3 characters on the hunt for buried gold. Two know the name of the graveyard ion which it is buried, but only one knows the grave. All 3 main characters steal the scene, and by having Title cards of the Good, the Bad and the Ugly, we get an idea who they are right away and why they are important. Clint Eastwood's Blondie is the most well known and the hero of the story, but Tuco and Angel Eyes are just as engaging and fun to watch onscreen.The overall story largely takes a back seat to smaller stories that happen along the way. It's about the journey rather than the destination, and the movies really takes it time developing its characters and set pieces. The scenes move slowly, with lots of stare downs. At 3 hours long, I admit a few scenes went on a little too long for me, but overall I really liked the pacing.The action still looks great, and holds up well. The fights are brutal and the gun battles are tense. The old film grain too gives this movie a very rugged feel.The visuals still look amazing in 2020. The scenery, set design and camerawork all come together so well and make for some impressive shots. I'm a sucker for long wide takes of scenery and the Good, the Bad and the Ugly has these in spades. You really get a feel for the old West here.The music is iconic and still spectacular, always setting the stage well. The main theme is just so cool, it plays a lot in the movie but I never get tired of hearing it.\nThe ADR is definitely off-sync though, and dialogue doesn't always match up. The tech might have not been there yet to probably do this (in fact this problem still happens), but I couldn't help but notice it and it took me out of scenes. I got used to it after a little while and with the rest of the movie standing out you might not even notice.Overall, it lives up to it's gigantic legacy and I highly recommend everyone watch the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.

It is the greatest movie of all time. Period. Regardless of genre. I could probably watch it every day, and be perfectly happy doing so.The music is perfection. The way the music drives this movie is absolutely amazing. The musical genius of Morricone and the incredible direction of Sergio Leone is a combination that will probably never be equaled.

The scene where Tuco runs through the graveyard with the song \"Ecstacy of Gold\" is pure poetry. And the showdown at the end with that great music- just incredible.The story is riveting.

The movie is long, but Leone's direction is so good that you will love the fact that you can enjoy this movie for three hours.Lee Van Cleef is my favorite spaghetti western actor, and he is incredible as \"Angel Eyes.\" It is the part he was born to play. Eli Wallach is perfect as Tuco. He really shines in this movie. Some people say he steals the show, and I can see why they think so. Eastwood is excellent as \"Blondie,\" although I don't think Eastwood has as strong of a presence as Van Cleef (I know many will disagree, and that's OK because all three actors are superb in this film so why split hairs?).This movie is hypnotic. It's operatic. It's sad. It's funny. It's gritty. It's violent. It's art. It's action. It's pure entertainment. The film is just so incredible on so many different levels that EVERYONE should see it, regardless of what kinds of movies they are into. And it's so cool that the greatest flick ever just happens to be a spaghetti western.

I was a bit hesitant at first to watch it because I generally don't care much for Westerns. But it sure was well worth the time.The story starts rather slow and throughout the movie there isn't al that much dialogue. The dialogue that is being said though, is absolute gold and the entire movie is filled with memorable quotes that will stick with you for a long time.\nThe cinematography draws you in and combined with the slow pace makes for a unique experience. You get completely lost in the beautiful landscape and it puts you in a place you don't want to get out of. The movie can be considered long, with a runtime of nearly three hours, but you find yourself wishing for more when it is over.I also wonder if there were ever three more compelling characters put together than 'The Good' (Clint Eastwood), 'The Bad' (Lee Van Cleef) and 'The Ugly' (Eli Wallach). Three completely different characters that work so well together on screen and bring with them a continuous tension that puts you at the edge of your seat. Eastwood's 'Blondie' is the most fascinating character of the three. A man of few words but everything he says and does is coolness personified. He brings with him the illusion of being the good guy and of having a moral center while killing his way to $200,000 in stolen gold.Van Cleef's 'Angel Eyes' is evil personified in the story. With those menacing eyes you sense right away that he is ruthless in everything he does. But still you're never quite sure what he is up to and he keeps you guessing as to what his next move will be. Wallach's 'Tuco' is a very complex character on his own. Having no problem in lying and deceiving to get what he wants. Yet you can't help to have a little bit of sympathy for him and he is responsible for some of the funniest lines in the movie. \"I get dressed, I kill him, be right back.\"The legendary score put together by Ennio Morricone is absolute perfection and brings a perfect sound to the amazing images. Tuco running through the cemetery whilst you hear \"The ecstacy of gold\" is one of the most memorable scenes i've ever seen in cinema. It is hard to find a more perfect half hour on film than the last thirty minutes of this Western epic.\nHow Sergio Leone manages to turn a stare down between three people in to one of the best and most exciting sequences put together is sheer excellence.Go watch this movie if you haven't already, you'll be glad you did.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 2}, "heading": "\"Well now, seems just like old times\"", "date": "2020-06-01T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5791416", "sentiment score": [0.0055, 0.0481, 0.1989, 0.6068, 0.1407]}, {"content": "Simply perfect in any way.The film addresses the story of three people who intertwine with each other, although it seems clich\u00e9 Sergio Leone gives it in an unmatched way. The relationship that occurs between Blondie and Tuco is entirely natural, at no time is forced because one must be with the other, it is that humanism that there are between them two that is reflected throughout the trip, where with small actions It shows how well built the characters are, there is enough solidity in the lines and by God! Boy, no one demeans the characters, even the prostitute says consistent lines. The first scene of the bad is incredible, his great willingness to get what he wants is reasonable, he does not seek to dominate the world or defeat the good, only someone who has a goal in mind.The re-enactment of the war of succession is avant-garde, it shows both leaders that there are no good or bad, only people who die for something that has no logic, we can see how those generals who are not in the history books saw the war as a suffering, a pain, a destiny to fulfill where the only thing there is death.The film rejoices in the best photographs of the landscapes of Europe, the framing of the characters has the reason why it turns to the right, left, up or down, there is a reason and reason why go towards the character, because looking from afar, because take the horse's legs. The music is sublime, of the best songs in the history of cinema Ennio Morriconne is the only one who can compose for a confrontation in broad daylight and with Sergio Leone doing each take prolongs the sequence and still have that emotion about what will happen.The edition as well as the art design do not remain relegated to the wardrobe, you can see the great quality and commitment that is in every detail.Not to mention the performances, Eastwood, Wallach and Van Cleef manage to withdraw from themselves, forget who they are, that there is a camera in front and they do it like no one else can, they make art with their performances, of course Tuco does Laughing, as it changes from solemnity to sarcasm in a few seconds is worthy of applause. Angel Eyes manages to make a very organic antagonist, he does not need to scream, kill everyone, he knows when to shoot and at no time does he feel pretended. Bolndie is such an endearing character, even if he is from the old west you manage to feel his fear, his thirst, his kindness and his solidarity, and boy did he have to work hard to hold a rifle with his hands and they didn't shake.I could talk more about the film, to notice how it influenced many directors such as Tarantino, Scorsese, DePalma, Kurbick, Spielberg, Lucas, Fincher, Nolan until the Russo but I will let you see it yourself and note that a dialogue with many is not necessary lines, a stellar and choral cast, great special effects and the best sound, you just need to have an idea, love and passion for your work, let yourself be overwhelmed by the creativity of a soundtrack and show that with little you can do a lot and that you cannot it is the \"what\" but the \"how\".", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 4, "votes": 5}, "heading": "One of the best of all time", "date": "2020-06-01T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5790787", "sentiment score": [0.0094, 0.0191, 0.0391, 0.3385, 0.5939]}, {"content": "If I had the job off having to re-write this film it would be the easiest job I had ever had as I wouldn't change a thing!", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 4}, "heading": "Perfect.", "date": "2020-05-31T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5789919", "sentiment score": [0.0456, 0.0663, 0.135, 0.29, 0.463]}, {"content": "This is the best western movie I've ever seen in my life.Amazing scenes and also very realistic.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Amazing, brutal ,fantastic ,best Western movie", "date": "2020-05-31T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5788978", "sentiment score": [0.0006, 0.0005, 0.0018, 0.0342, 0.963]}, {"content": "Very nice film, I'm like the best was the first time!", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Nice film", "date": "2020-05-31T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5787076", "sentiment score": [0.0014, 0.0016, 0.0163, 0.3581, 0.6226]}, {"content": "I saw this film in a cinema when it was first released and viewed it again yesterday on British TV.

It's hard to pick a favorite scene, for every rewatch there's a different one. Of course, the film's climax with the immortal 'Ecstasy of Gold' and the unbearable suspense of the last standoff are its most celebrated moments, and the two-and-a-half-hour journey to get there could easily be a drag. Only, it isn't.The character introductions. Blondie and Tuco's chemistry and scheming. Angel Eyes' pursue for the cash box. A half-soldier. Tuco assembling his own gun. The desert sequence. Tuco and brother Ramirez. The POW camp. Digestive music. Wallace beating the crap out of Tuco. Blondie and Angel Eyes teaming up. Six men, six bullets. Bathtub scene. \"When you have to shoot, shoot. Don't talk.\" The street shootout. The drunk Union Captain and the bridge. Sad Hill cemetery.Those are some of the treats this classic has to offer, and I think it makes it one of the most rewatchable movies ever made. But what else is there to enjoy?The soundtrack: Thinking of Sergio Leone is to think of Ennio Morricone, and this may be is magnum opus if you had to choose one. From the iconic whistling theme to the epic final standoff and the aforementioned 'The Ecstasy of Gold' (which if you've ever been to a Metallica concert, they always opens their shows with). But there are also the small bits between - trumpets, acoustic guitar and harmonica tunes breaths life to the backdrop that is the American Civil War (at least Leone's vision of it).The cinematography: Shot in Spain, posing as the American Southwest, Italian cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli fills every frame with gorgeous composition and gritty detail. There are so many iconic shots that are burned into cinema history and for this rewatch I finally got to enjoy it on Blu-ray in hi-def.Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo: As the title suggests, this story revolves around its characters. Lee Van Cleef as the villainous Angel Eyes is both cold and charismatic. Clint Eastwood as Blondie is the definition of cool. He always keeps his calm and doesn't speak unless he's got something badass to say. He also smokes cigar, has superhuman aim and he blows hats off people's heads. And there's Eli Wallach as Tuco - the unsung hero of this whole story. He's the shifty bandit you can't trust for a second. He's also got superhuman aim and I just love his swagger. He always makes me laugh, even when he's not talking, just his facial expressions cracks me up. He's also the character we get most backstory on, besides being the clown of the company, and you just can't help to feel sorry for him in the end. Perhaps my favorite character of all time. Those are the three mains which the story revolves around, but Leone had a talent for creating memorable minor roles as well - the alcoholic Union Captain in particular, who appears more than two hours into the film, heavily drunk and heavily dubbed, is downright hilarious.The charm: It's about America, made by Italians, shot mainly in Spain. Apart from the three American leads, most of the dialogue is dubbed, as the rest of the cast were either Italian or Spanish. But it doesn't mean the performances are bad or that it feels out of place - no, it just further enriches the everlasting charm of the spaghetti western and Leone's cinematic world. It's also a very unrealistic film - with comedically accurate gunslingers, revolvers sounding like cannons and the whole 'historical' setting. I've always regarded it as a borderline fantasy film, and I love it for it. It is plain and simple movie magic.Love it or hate it, 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' is undoubtably one of the most iconic films of all time and a big part of cinema history.

I've seen a lot of western movies in my life, and I enjoyed the majority of them. But, none of them have ever come close to matching this one. Perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects and a perfect soundtrack. The story at first glance just sounds like your typical hunt for gold. But, I assure you that it's presented in such a very fresh and unique way. One thing to point out, most western films usually have a duel scene at some point during the movie. This film has a three-way duel at the end, you're probably wondering: \"how does that work?\" Well, that's all I'm going to say about that. You'll have to watch the movie and see for yourself! The acting is nothing short of sublime from the whole cast. Clint Eastwood puts on a flawless performance as Blondie. Eli Wallach is fantastic as Tuco, the friend/enemy of Blondie. Lee Van Cleef is exceptional as Angel Eyes, the main villain. As for the rest of the cast, they are just as exceptional. The sets/locations are spectacular and give this movie a great atmosphere. All of the special effects are very well-done, and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack composed by Ennio Morricone is phenomenal. It is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of my top 10 all-time favorite film scores. My personal favorite parts of the soundtrack are: \"The Ecstasy of Gold\", \"The Trio\" and the main theme song is one of my top 10 favorite opening theme songs in any movie. The film score sets the tone right from beginning to end. That's one way you can tell that you have a phenomenal soundtrack, when you play it at any random point in the song itself and recognize what movie, or show, it's from. The soundtrack for this movie is nothing short of memorable and iconic, kudos to you, Ennio Morricone! \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" is a cinematic masterpiece. Another thing, it's just shy of three hours long. But, I can promise you, the three hours go by in a flash. It doesn't even feel like three hours, yet it is. What more can I say? I could watch this film 1,000 times in a row and never get bored with it. Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you love western films, and you haven't seen \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" yet, what are you waiting for? Go and watch it today! I promise that you will not regret it.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "This is, without question, the greatest western film in cinema.", "date": "2020-04-27T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5684539", "sentiment score": [0.0067, 0.0164, 0.0414, 0.3667, 0.5688]}, {"content": "Unbelievable masterpiece of Sergio Leone that made great movies and this one for sure the best of his career.

If you fancy thinking a little differently about 'T he Good, The Bad and The Ugly', try the following. Look past Clint Eastwood's legend-founding performance and suppose that the central character is actually Eli Wallach's Tuco, the Ugly. A gross rogue, guilty of every possible vice, Tuco is after all the character we see and hear the most, about who m we learn the most, and through whom we experience much of the action. Eli Wallach makes him comic, poignant, and plausible - certainly compared to the unrestrained darkness of Lee Van Cleef and the impossible cool of Eastwood. The film is largely Tuco's struggle to survive, and to earn a little on the side, constantly battered between Eastwood's \"blo nd Angel\" and Van Cleef's angel of death. Angels? Indeed: Tuco is ultimately human, and Tuco is all of us - grubby, corrupt, uncomfortable and slightly desperate humans, veering between the good and the bad, subject to a perplexing God and an unrelenting Devil, and just trying to muddle along.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "We're all tuco \ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5\ud83d\udca5", "date": "2020-04-25T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5676059", "sentiment score": [0.0064, 0.0124, 0.0196, 0.1863, 0.7753]}, {"content": "Finally The Good The Bad And The Ugly (1966)\nNow that's what i call Real Men's Cinema. No love story, no melodrama, no emotions just the bullets and machoism till the last stage. A real man would love this film more than any other love triangle story with women and Romance involved in it or a happy go lucky film because this is stuff made only and only for Men. I doubt any such particular film was ever made for Women or will ever be made. We Men are lucky, aren't we? Possibly, it is the Spaghetti western which was better than many big budget films in the genre. I can sense so many nuances in the screenplay where the hero proves that this is how a real man should be. The other 2 guys doesn't care much about anything but money. Clint Eastwood as The Good proves what the real Good means even in bad encounter. Lee Van Cleef as the Bad brings the cruelty into the character whereas Eli Wallach as Tuco AKA the Ugly did exceptionally well. If i have to mention some iconic scenes then i would go with the introduction scene of all 3 guys in the film. One can do anything if he is paid, other one is lusty for money and the 3rd guy is one hell of a good fella, doesn't matter what the situation is. Other than that, there are multiple situations which i can say are influential and iconic and have inspired so many action films over the years. The Background score which is still giving me chills. The Good The Bad and The Ugly is well known as Sergio Leone most hard-hitting work and totally different vision to look at a western film. The distinctive use of violence, cold blooded encounters, stylistic bullets fires and machoism of the lead hero all these things surely makes The Good The Bad and The Ugly a Classic Western Action film. And like i said, if you're bored of typical romance, unnecessary melodrama and mainstream dramas then this film is the most different experience for you just like it was for entire generation of 60s Cinema Lovers.\nRating- 8/10*", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Now that's what I call real men's cinema..

The three cowboys are silent and close to each other. The lens is pulled very close, and it is basically a close-up of the face. This distance is uncomfortable and produces a sense of depression. There are no lines here, only background sounds, rendering a strong tension, a precursor to the war. A large number of close-up close-ups are one of the features of this film. The director intends to highlight the character's character through body language and expression close-ups. From the beginning to 10:37 seconds, there is no line at all, I thought it was a color silent film. This shooting technique that only uses music, body language and expression is full of ritual and a little stage drama feeling (here I am also picking up teeth). \"The ugly\", \"the bad\" and \"the good\" characters appeared on the side with subtitles. This is also very classic in the history of movies. There are no lines in early movies. When the characters and plots are not rich enough , The director needs to add subtitles in the post-editing to illustrate the character identity and enrich the character image; when he was a child, he often saw it in the martial arts movies that watched the Shaw Brothers movie. In this audio film, we already know the characters (the director used a large amount of ink to describe the three people). Why should we use subtitles to show their identity? This way of emphasizing precisely expresses the sense of ritual. It can be said that in this rough ore-like western film, there is a hint of literary art.Cross-cutting is another major feature of the film. When \"the ugly\" took three little brothers to find \"the good\" revenge: the army stepping outside the house, the cowboy who quietly went upstairs, the \"the \"Good\", in fact, these three things happen at the same time, the film advances the plot through the conversion of three scenes. Another example is the climax of the film. At the end, the three men confront each other. The camera continuously switches between the faces of the three people, and then the switching speed becomes faster and faster. This single and pure expression is now rarely seen in the film. From the simplification, now seeing this pure thing is rather exciting.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Nostalgic moment", "date": "2020-04-18T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5652072", "sentiment score": [0.0563, 0.2434, 0.2451, 0.3536, 0.1016]}, {"content": "The movie is old i don't think that i will love everything but i was wrong this movie is from another universe the story the actors the director the soundtrack everything is 10/10", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "The masterpiece of western movies of all time", "date": "2020-04-18T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5651030", "sentiment score": [0.344, 0.2368, 0.2046, 0.0949, 0.1197]}, {"content": "At the end of the trilogy, it can be seen that due to the rising budget, one of the trilogy's narratives is more magnificent than the first one: the first is a single-line narrative of a single scene (town), and the second is a single-line narrative of a multi-scenario ( The goal of chasing the bounty), to the last part is a multi-scenes multi-line narrative, and even put it in the context of the Civil War, quite the taste of western epic. It also reached the apex in the soundtrack, not only has the extremely classic main theme, but also other long soundtracks have very good melody.The story tells three people. The ugly, the bad, the good have a common goal: a treasure chest with 200,000 gold coins hidden. This goal is essentially the same as the reward object. The first two know half of the information, and Dongmu Hold the other half of the message. Contrary to the second part, the rhythm of the first half of this part is slow, and it suddenly became tight when it entered the battlefield. The final three-person duel is also 100 times more exciting than the previous two-man or one-to-many duel, because you ca n't guess every Who will shoot first?The ugly is undoubtedly a comedy character, he is funny, but also quite ambitious. The bad is indeed bad, and it is no wonder that in the end, the other two will choose to fight him first. Our Dongmu is still a decent one, and the conversation with the other two is quite the first to stir up the gang.The addition of war scenes is to my understanding that the director's aversion to violence is a concentrated manifestation: Western cowboys are fighting each other for personal money, and even paying the price of their lives. It seems so naive and worthless in the face of the death and injury of war. And this tragic battle is only for a broken bridge that is meaningless to the non-commissioned officer, why not ironic.In general, this is a magnificent movie.

With this number, they go around several other cities. At some point, all the lines of the heroes intersect ...\nLeone set himself the task of showing the absurdity of the war and the complete absence of any good motives in them.\nThe budget of the last film of the trilogy was significantly larger than the first two parts.

This is one of those movies that you can speak for days and not be over with all the many good things it did, is almost crazy to belive that this movie was panned by critics at the time, probably a response to a product of it\u00b4s time but from another country, we should agree. However critics where proved wrong with this movie and had to appreciate a Western that in many ways was more revolutionary and arguably better than anything produced in Hollywood.Sergio Leone Direction for this movie is iconic and now one of the things that distinguish this type of movies, with beautiful and slow cinematographic long shots, extreme close ups, the storytelling he used and how graphich it was visually (At the time), but most iportant the build of tention he did in so many scenes, when you know something gonna happen but you have no idea when would happen, but when does happen it marks the movie and your life.The acting in this movie is very underaprecciated in general, the main Trio has so much presence by them selves that they stole every inch of screen they are in, Ellie Wallach as Tuco is funny yet ragging, charismatic and just enbodies \"The Ugly\" as a word better than anyone has done; Lee Van Cleef as Sentenza \"Angel Eyes\" is so menacing, there\u00b4s no scene including him that make you think contrary, his incarnation of \"the Bad\" is just that, someone that appears to have no soul and would kill twisting his own rules at bennefit; and finally Clint Eastwood as Blondie, \"the Good\" that isn\u00b4t exactly good, a bounty hunter that has dubious moral codes, he is so unpredictable in what he is gonna do and how he is gonna do it, yet has some good in him and is the smartest of the trio, not to say the better gunslinger (in all movies arguably). The rest of the supporting cast does a good job at it, never outmatching the main charachters but doing really good carachterization and making the film have more weight, the shop owner, the soldiers, the Generals, the killers, all of them have a poruse on the film and add something special to the film.The Score is another big one of this film, Ennio Morricone is a genius mind and there\u00b4s no better man to writte music for this genre of film than him, he easly outmatches most composers of Western movies and composers in movies in general. His score really put you in the mood of the scene, in how you are supossed to feel the film, in how raw the life was back then, the Main theme, Eacstsy of Gold, The Trio, the Sundown are great pieces of music, that\u00b4s how movie themes should work and how they have to make you feel.This movie really broke the rules of typical film making as well, is one of those movies that don\u00b4t really care that much about the plot, wich in any other movie would feel wrong, but this one makes their scenes so heavy and so much happens on screen at the same moment that the plot becomes almost a non factor for the film, is a movie about circumstances that happen to their carachters and how they deal with them in that exact moments not really caring when it would get to the end of the plot, is much more about their stories and what they leave behind, however there is a plot but the film don\u00b4t rushes into it, it takes it\u00b4s time to get there and is so satisfying.We already talked about the acting, but it\u00b4s worth talking about how this movie was one that popularized double sided charachters, specailly with Tuco and Blondie, it really don\u00b4t let you make up your mind about what you feel about them, the only thing you know is that they might be bad or good any moments, specailly that of the Man with no name, altough Wallach\u00b4s acting stole the show, Eastwood is one fo those presence actors that just need to put a cigar in his mouth and he will change movies forever and his charachter in this movie, cold, smart, few words spoken, and overall bad ass really changued movies to this very day, there\u00b4s so many movies that stole that concept and implemented into their own, not only in westerns but in action movies and Sci-Fi, there would not be Han Solos, Snake Pilskims or even Indiana Jones withouth the grandad of dirty players wich was Blondie.There\u00b4s too much to talk about this movie again and most of all is positive to excelent, so whenever you have the chance go and Watch it, is the final instalment of the Dollars Trio or the Man with no name trilogy, yo surely won\u00b4t be dissapointed.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 2}, "heading": "A Fantastic breaking rules movie that defined the genre and Cinema on the way.", "date": "2020-01-25T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5435760", "sentiment score": [0.0916, 0.333, 0.301, 0.2124, 0.062]}, {"content": "I really liked \"The good, the bad and the ugly\".

The film is directed by Sergio Leone and is the conclusion to the Dollars Trilogy, which also starred Clint Eastwood. The film centers on three outlaws who are on the hunt to find a fortune in gold buried in a cemetery. To kick-start this review off I will mention that this is the final chapter in the Dollars Trilogy. The Dollars Trilogy are three spaghetti films starring Clint Eastwood as the Man with No Name. And these three movies are major influences that have inspired countless western films to come. But unlike the first two films, I think I speak for everyone in saying that this is the film that brings a breath of fresh air to the western genre. Even though the movie is called The Good the Bad, and the Ugly, the movie does display its good, bad, and ugly side to things. I don't know if it was Sergio Leone's intention to go all out in the final chapter and have this be his magnum opus, but he needs to work on the run time. This movie is three hours and in those three hours the movie felt like it was all over the place as we focus on these three outlaws hunting for buried treasure, but then it jumps to the American Civil War. There just needed to be some common ground on whoever wrote the script, but I didn't feel any connection. And when this movie was released, people didn't like it and received criticism as well. And in a way I feel like I fit that category because I didn't like it after it was finished, but it grew on me after. But ignoring its three-hour run time, the movie does make up for its brilliant dialogue, acting, and the music department. The music does a great job building that suspense feeling and I as I was watching this zoning in and out, as soon as that theme song kicked in, I knew I was in for a ride. And that last scene alone is enough for me to say that you should definitely watch this if you're not a fan of the western genre. I'm not the biggest fan of western genres, but Clint Eastwood makes any western movie enjoyable to watch that no other western character can top Clint Eastwood's charm and charisma. So in the end, even though this movie is three hours long to the point where it bore me to tears, the movie grew on me to the point that I realize while it may not be the best movie of the western genre, its still the one western movie I would recommend watching regardless if you hate western movies.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Not a big fan of westerns, but I like this one", "date": "2020-01-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5390527", "sentiment score": [0.0246, 0.1253, 0.377, 0.3865, 0.0867]}, {"content": "Some people may find this movie long, or somehow boring, I don't know exactly why, but I could watch a serie of this", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "AMAzING MOVIE", "date": "2019-12-26T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5356284", "sentiment score": [0.1083, 0.3659, 0.4431, 0.0721, 0.0106]}, {"content": "I have to admit this is a good movie but since everyone is saying this is the best western ever made I feel obligated to point out why this is not.1.

Clint Eastwood is a bad ass, there simply is no denying it. He is the Badass cowboy that will steal your girl and in the same instant earn your respect, and I have nothing other to say than he was born to play the role of Blondie. Now he also had a great lineup of supporting actors who helped him gain such acclaim but they just don't hold a candle to Mrs. Eastwood.There is also the plot which is a like a headphones cord that is so tangled that the audience is forced to watch as Sergio Leone slowly untangles each separate knot, giving the appearance of separate stories but inevitably straightening to reveal that it is intact a single line. Now it may not be a complicated nonlinear story with loads of flashbacks but Sergio Leone proves himself a true filmmaker by unraveling a story rather the simple telling the audience the events that take place.Finally I want to touch on the score. This to me is where the movie really shines, because despite all the cowboy reality it is the score that connects the story together. Building tension with every whistle and drumlins, changing the simple shots into something meaningful. It is not an understatement when I say that this score is the single most iconic score of all time.I am giving this movie a 9/10 because this to me is more than just cinema, it is emotions caught on 2.35:1.

The best performance however, in my opinion, is done by Eli Wallach who absolutely kills as Tuco! The first hour of the movie is almost exclusively with Tuco as the main character and he has by far the most lines and delivers perfectly in every scene. Tuco is also the inarguably best developed character and you get a lot of back story and personal encounters, explaining how he became who he is. Lee Van Cleef of course does a fantastic vilain as \"the Bad\" Angel Eyes.Watching this movie as an adult has given me a new perspective: \"Blondie\" is not a saint and I can fully understand Tuco's wish for revenge, they also get back at each other several times in the movie which is really well done in the fantastic screenplay! Blondie's character is based on the \"silent and mysterious lone gunman\" which works for this movie because Clint Eastwood is so awesome and perfect for the role, but I do feel that some backstory or more dialogue would have lifted the character because you never really get to know him, which is sad only because of the fact that I want to know more of this the best ever Western character! I also see the fantastic musical score and how it's used to perfection. The 3 characters are a perfect match and the story is just absolutely amazing and you forget that you're watching a movie, dreaming away to days if the Civil War America.What really holds this movie together and lifts it to the sky is the MUSIC. I cranked the volume up so high my ears started to hurt because I wanted to feel the music to it's Max. The exact right music in the exact right time lifts almost every scene and Oh My God is the music good!

Each one slowly lets the film unfold with a certain style and grace, revealing more about each character and what's going on. The pacing is incredible, as is the direction - Sergio Leone manages to build a lot of uncomfortable tension in the film, keeping the film from ever getting predictable. Any typical Western clich\u00e9 that you can possibly think of is either given a unique twist or utterly destroyed by Leone's masterful storytelling. Of special mention is Ennio Morricone's score, which is absolutely perfect. Two scenes - one in a Union prison camp, one in the climatic gunfight in the cemetery at the end of the film - are amazing on their own, but they become absolutely astonishing with combined with Morricone's powerful score.The Good, the Bad and the Ugly or the Good, the Better and the Best, as I prefer calling it, is a bizarrely sublime and a uniquely aesthetic masterpiece. The actors in title roles have given such extraordinarily superb performances, that it would be impertinent and disparaging to merely regard their swell work as acting. In fact their brilliant portrayals have immortalized Blondie, Sentenza/ Angel Eyes and the enigmatic Tuco. Lee Van Cleef is fiendishly unforgiving as the merciless Angel Eyes. Clint Eastwood is rugged yet suave, cocky yet adorable as laconic cigar-smoker Blondie, a role that laid the foundations of his illustrious career. But it is Eli Wallach, who steals the show with his captivating portrayal of Tuco, a portrayal that is as entrancing as it is enlightening. Wallach is amusing, capricious, nonchalant, uncanny and yet tenacious as Tuco, perturbed by his insecurities and dampened by his solitude. It is the tacit amicability between Blondie and Tuco and their mutual hostility towards the evil Angel Eyes owing to the vestiges of virtue present in them, redolent of their moribund morality, which gives the story, the impetus and the characters, a screen presence that is not only awe inspiring but also unparalleled.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "My Opinion", "date": "2019-08-21T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5072494", "sentiment score": [0.0026, 0.0056, 0.0157, 0.2276, 0.7485]}, {"content": "Since there isn't much original that I can add, I just want to make sure that no stone is unturned.

But first things first. The director here is Sergio Leone and he is also one of many people working on the screenplay here. The movie runs for considerably over 2 hours and there are many versions out there, one of them even crossing the 3-hour mark. The cast includes many well-established actors and the big name by today's standards is of course Clint Eastwood who was in his mid-30s when this was made. Maybe Eli Wallach (who almost turned 100 before his death not too long ago) is also still known to many and maybe even Lee Van Cleef, who did not get as old as the other two. These three play the main characters in this movie we got here, the three mentioned in the title. And there is a nice introduction so we know who is who. And the ugly even gets another quick mention near the end, maybe because his one at the beginning was so short. Honestly we learn a lot more about the ugly in the introduction of the good than in his own introduction. Or maybe he gets the one at the end because in my opinion he was just the most memorable of the three and Eli Wallach also gave the best performance in the movie. Already how effortlessly he looked like a Hispanic was impressive because he really was a Jew. And he is also the one who kept this film from becoming too serious because his character always brought in some comedy value and even during these moments when Eastwood makes a short funny one-liner like along the lines of \"idiots they are talking to you\" Wallach is present and his body language adds a lot to the fun element. But people should not mistake Tuco for a fool. He may not be educated or a leader, but he makes up for it with grit determination and also ruthlessness. And there is also a soft side to him, he is not as cold-blooded as Sentenza, who would kill anybody if he had to. Tuco's soft side is especially brought out by his brother as we see during one scene and despite being a ruthless killer he believes in God and salvation it seems. He also mostly really only kills those who did something bad to him first, such as Eastwood's character, but also Sentenza's big henchman.Sentenza really has no mercy for anybody and he is also a schemer unlike Tuco. A really dangerous man, who still is a man of his word. When he makes a contract, he fulfills it. You could also call him talented when it comes to upping the ranks as you see when the two more central characters get caught in a funny sequence that involves a lot of dust. But like I said nobody here delivers the comedy as good as Tuco/Wallach. Even if he goes over the top, it is still hilarious to watch and never feels out of place. The best example is really the scene when he all of a sudden acts like a best friend to Blondie to find out the name of the grave where the treasure is hidden. By the way, I also liked at the very end that there was an actual treasure and not just some meaningful message \u00e0 la \"the biggest treasure is friendship\" or so. There is none of that anyway. The three-men shootout shows it best. It is a matter of life and death. Honestly if the other two, especially Tuco, had been as smart as Blondie they could have guessed where the treasure really is. There must be a reason he knows the name and surely it is not that the name he mentions was a deceased friend or so. Also makes sense Blondie does not tell Tuco the real name, he is too smart for that, just like the empty name on the stone. Also pretty fitting that the treasure is in the grave of an unknown soldier in terms of the political message the movie sends. It takes place during the days of the Civil War and there is one lengthy sequence when Tuco and Blondie are led along by a captain and this is the one occasion during which the focus is not really on these two, but on the pointlesssness of war back then just like today. The bridge is the best example. They won't fight for it, but just go elsewhere and fight if it is gone. It's pretty deep and telling how the captain waits for the bridge to be destroyed and smiles before he passes. So yeah this was interesting because the sequence felt so different compared to the rest of the movie, but still it felt like an essential inclusion nonetheless.Basically I could really write a novel about every single scene here. Other people have said it correctly that each and every one of them adds a lot. Also the small characters are memorable like the fat henchman I already mentioned. Or the guy who lost a hand and wants his revenge on Tuco and probably half a dozen other characters who maybe would have deserved their own movie. But good that these three got it. Actually, in the German title there are only two characters mentioned and called something like crooks. I still prefer the three, even if Sentenza / Angel Eyes is not as much in the center as the other two. Now finally a few words on Blondie as a big Eastwood fan. He was coolness personified, but not an invincible superhero as you see from how he is tricked by Tuco during the spikes scene and even if he gets away there, Tuco gets him again, which shows you he knows how to get his revenge. During the lengthy desert scene he really suffers badly, but still most of the time he is nicely in control of it all. A really memorable character we got here, even if maybe how he is depicted with baby kittens was slightly too much. We get it he's the good guy, the only one really with morals and nonetheless as relentless and determined as the other two. That he cares at least a bit for other people is shown in the scene when he has too say goodbye to Shorty when he found another partner in crime for his bounty hunting scam. He was not as blond as I thought he was though that he deserved the nickname. I watched this movie as part of a retrospective on Ennio Morricone and it was a truly nice experience. It was not the first time I saw it and honestly it did not take away any of the quality, or almost none, that I basically knew the key plot points, even if it has been a long time since I saw it. So yeah I already mentioned Morricone, his soundtrack here is really as defining as it gets for the western genre which was also proved by the people dancing and moving in their seats in my showing every time the soundtrack was heard and so is the movie itself. No doubt most people consider this one of the five finest western movies ever made, if not the number one even. And I can see where they are coming from. Really almost everything works out about this one, also the sound side away from the music, be it the effects of running horses or gunfire you just really felt inside the movie. What did not work out was Wallach's and everybody else's glaring omission from awards bodies. Oh yeah also this is one of the westerns that has no female love interest for the protagonist(s). The woman you see in Bad's presentation for example is all you get. And that is perfectly fine and enough. I give it a big thumbs-up and it is a definite contender for best film of 1966.

This is my number 1 favorite Spaghetti Western about the Civil War and three gunslingers on a search for a lost gold. I love this film to death. It is my personal favorite western movie of all time. Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef are the best of the film in their roles. It has a great showdown in the cemetery on the end of the film, the way how it is edited. The cuts with people's faces and close up shots. I love this film to death and it is my number one favorite western in the trilogy. If I had to put then into a 'favorite ranking' list? 1. The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, 2. A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More. Those are all three best masterpieces ! They are my favorite Clint Eastwood western movies in the series and they are really my favorite westerns that I am still watching today.I love the music score by Ennio Morricone that did wrote different and new theme music score for this film. The Action sequences are awesome and the bullets are flying, the guns in this film are plenty. The scene action are also good which this film makes such an entertainment from begging till end. It is the third entry in to The Dollars trilogy or better known the Man with No Name, it is the final installment of The Dollars Trilogy. This film is a classic that made Clint Eastwood in to a big star that he is today.An epic Western that follows the adventures of three gunfighters looking for $200,000 in stolen gold, Sergio Leone's 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' is one of his best masterpiece, one that continues to get better and better with each viewing. A bounty hunting scam joins two men in an uneasy alliance against a third in a race to find a fortune in gold buried in a remote cemetery. The inimitable \"Man With No Name\" teams with two gunslingers (Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach) to pursue a fortune in stolen gold. But teamwork doesn't come naturally to the outlaws, and they soon discover that their greatest challenge is to stay alive in a country ravaged by war. Forging and Vibrant and yet detached style of action never before seen and not matched since, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly shatters the western mold in true Eastwood Style! The film is known for Leone's use of long shots and close-up cinematography, as well as his distinctive utilization of violence, tension, and stylistic gunfights.The plot revolves around three gunslingers competing to find fortune in a buried cache of Confederate gold amidst the violent chaos of the American Civil War (specifically the New Mexico Campaign in 1862), while participating in many battles and duels along the way. The film was the third collaboration between Leone and Clint Eastwood, and the second with Lee Van Cleef. Still the race and the three gunslingers were just fantastic who will get the first the gold. The final scene on the cemetery is one of the best action scenes ever. The iconic Mexican standoff, with Tuco, Angel-Eyes in the middle, and Blondie is the best scene in the film. The trio all separately are traveling trough American Civil War who doesn't want any part of the war to do.Clint Eastwood as \"Blondie\" (a.k.a. the Man with No Name): a subdued, bounty hunter did a really wonderful job as the good person, he showed that he is honest a good kind gunslinger. I think Clint Eastwood as Blondie did made memorable character and one of his the best acting performance on screen I have ever saw. Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes: The Bad, a ruthless, unfeeling, and sociopathic mercenary who always finishes a job he is paid for. Did a terrific job as the villain in this film, gosh this movie is awesome! He convinced me of his acting skills that he is a professional actor. Eli Wallach as Tuco \"The Rat\" The Ugly, a comical, oafish was amazing in his role, Sergio Leone choose him for this film with natural talent as the main cast. Those trio actors did a wonderful job as a different gunslingers on searching for a gold. The film also has humor and it is also brilliant in the both terms, the scene on cemetery where Tuco arrives first and is looking for a tombstone was brilliant. It turned out the gold was buried in a unmarked grave, that was hard to find. I was laughing when Blondie throws a shovel to Tuco for digging up the grave and the Angles Eyes comes and throws another shovel for Blondie, where both of them have to dig now the grave the scene was funny. They are a lot of moments in this film. 10/10 my number1 favorite in the trilogy, I love this film to death.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 4}, "heading": "brilliant work done by everyone, must watch one time", "date": "2019-05-26T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4888783", "sentiment score": [0.0033, 0.007, 0.0205, 0.1692, 0.7999]}, {"content": "I submit that my review title is a more accurate descriptor of the 3 stars than the given film title. Clint Eastwood, as \"Blondie\", may be the justified ultimate victor, but I see little in him that is good. I don't like westerns with too much gun play, and too many corpses piling up. There is an abundance of both here, some justified, some not. Blondie, on several occasions just mows down a bunch of people for no reason. He tries to get extra bounty money by collaborating with escaped Mexican bandit Tuco(Eli Wallach), to deliver him to peace officers in exchange for a bounty reward, which he would later share with Tuco, after he had cut the suspending rope tied around Tuco's neck with a gun shot. Tuco would ride off on the horse he was sitting on. When they reconvened, they went to the next town and tried the same trick. But something was bound to go wrong eventually. So, Tuco stuck up Blondie and made him walk a long way across a desert with no water, and no protection from the sun. When Blondie was virtually dead, they came upon a closed wagon full of dead or nearly dead bodies. While Tuco is getting water for the one barely alive man, this man tells Blondie the name on the grave where a fortune in gold is hidden. Blondie tells Tuco he knows the relevant grave site, but not which graveyard it's in. Tuco then gives Blondie some water and shade, and they agree to eventually share the 2 parts of the puzzle..........After they have found the cache of gold coins, Blondie, not trusting Tuco, ties his hands behind his back, fashions a hanging rope, has him stand on a rickety grave cross, and puts the noose around his neck. Blondie leaves Tuco's share of gold at his feet, then rides off. Responding to Tuco's pleading, Blondie turns around , and from some distance, breaks the rope with a single shot, thus completing this redundant gag, after which Blondie continues to ride off into the sunset, while Tuco is left in this bleak waterless desert, with his hands tied behind his back,, and no horse. This was Blondie's way of extracting revenge for several transgressions of Tuco. Tuco had nearly succeeded in hanging Blondie, except for a traumatic interruption. Also, for Tuco nearly killing him by making him walk across that waterless desert. Tuco showed his sadistic side by tempting Blondie with some water, then throwing it away. Also, Tuco had tried to get to the relevant grave before Blondie, after Blondie told him where it was. Crafty Blondie told him wrong in case he had the idea to make off with all the gold. .......The occasional switch between 2 of the 3 main characters being reluctant buddies to being outright enemies is an important factor in making this an interesting western.........Angel Eyes(Lee Van Cleef) has some encounters with the other two relating to finding the treasure. At last, Blondie writes the name of the relevant grave on a rock(?), and places it in middle of a triangle formed by the 3 men. A three-way duel ensues. Blondie shoots Angel Eyes dead, and previously unloaded Tuco's gun. Thus, he is the winner, sparing Tuco's life, for the present, and awarding him half the gold, but as I previously described, Blondie imposes severe restrictions of Tuco's ability to make use of all that gold...........I think the film could have been tightened by about 30min.,to make it seem less daunting. The 3 main actors did an excellent job. Incidentally, Eastwood was a non-smoker, thus objected to having a cigarillo in the corner of his mouth in nearly every scene.

Also, it's a spoiler free review, and it may seem to be a little vague.Good : It's a masterpiece. Don't agree with me? I don't care at all. Leone's visual storytelling has never been so great. The scores, the activities of the characters, the scenes were enough to tell the story. The dialogues are simply conversations between the characters. In the entire three hour runtime, there isn't a single expositionary dialogue, except for a total of 5 minutes. That's a very difficult task to do, and it does it with such an ease that we don't even notice it during the first viewing. Many difficult scenes have been shot very perfectly, which feels really obvious. There are a few point of view shots which makes it more interesting. The characterizations given to each of the three lead characters justify them as good, bad and ugly. There are many moments which justify their characterizations. Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach have done a complete justice to their roles. This movie, being set in the American Civil War, has some elements of it. However, it doesn't glorify the war and doesn't take any side. It portrays war as one of the worst things - just like in the way it should be. The war scenes are too damn good. Well choreographed and incredible cinematography. You can see a whole bunch of people engaging, and it obviously was not CGI. It wasn't really necessary to show all of that, but it did and it was great (Sergio Leone rocks!). The violence does feel real and legit, in contrast to many of the older Westerns. Last but the important thing would be music, Ennio Morricone's score is entirely of next level good. Incomprehensibly great. It complements every scene and either escalates the tension (eg. the final showdown) or just develops emotional and dramatic factors. Also, contrary to this, there are some moments of silence which serve similar purpose of escalating the tension and drama. The music is so good that even if you (somehow) end up not liking the film, you will definitely love the score by Morricone. It has absolutely no negatives whatsoever. It deserves every bit of praise it receives.Conclusion : This is the Citizen Kane of Westerns. Every Western film (not necessarily Spaghetti) is compared with this. There is a reason why. This is a highly recommended film not only for Western lovers, but for every movie lover out there. As for me, I heard a lot of great things about it, then, I was ready to be disappointed, but I was blown away by it. It was way above my initial expectations, and delivered a lot more than that. Recently, only Infinity War managed to do so. It is a gem of a movie.Rating.Score : absolute 10/10Grade : A+", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 22, "votes": 28}, "heading": "Greatest Western of all times!", "date": "2019-04-14T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4781248", "sentiment score": [0.0114, 0.0881, 0.3715, 0.4759, 0.0531]}, {"content": "Truly one of my inspirations for making motion pictures come to life here in the US and especially here in Arizona.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Without any question, an iconic motion picture for the annals of film history.", "date": "2019-03-30T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4751579", "sentiment score": [0.0012, 0.0011, 0.0045, 0.0803, 0.9129]}, {"content": "What could be left to be said?

This is one of the Most important and influential movies in history, this is what directors should watch for inspiration when they are trying to make a 'great' movie. People Cannot call themselves 'Movie buffs' until they have watched 'The good the bad and the ugly'. Clint Eastwood plays his role as 'The man with no name' Elegantly, keeping the mysterious tone the character had in the previous films whilst still showing different emotions as the movie progresses, this is one of Clint Eastwoods' finest roles. Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach also played their roles tremendously with each of them displaying their characters emotions and motives clearly and beautifly. The movie has some of the most suspenseful and engaging action sequences in movie history and I was left at the edge of my seat at the end of most of them, as for the final showdown; let's just say it's one of the greatest scenes in Cinema history. The movie also has a brilliantly written script and some of the finest cinematography ever, this makes the already engaging and action packed story even better. The good The bad and The ugly ticks all the boxes when it comes to doing things right, directors from today need to remember how geniuses like Sergio Leone crafted pieces of art like the good the bad and the ugly, with an fantastic story, brilliant actors, incredible script, suspenseful action scenes, beautiful cinematography and one of the finest soundtrack of all time, not only is 'the good the bad and the ugly' the greatest western of all time...

Eli Wallach would've gotten Best Supporting Actor. Lee Van Cleef would've gotten a Best Supporting Actor nomination. Sergio Leone, Best Director.

But everything about this movie is what makes it an all-time classic. Especially the reason it could never be successfully remade. The acting, screenwriting, directing, camera work, and brilliant musical score by Ennio Morricone are what make it unique to the point it can never be duplicated or improved.

That is high praise, setting up even higher expectations going into a film for the first time. However I can honestly say that this movie lived up to the hype from the acting to the cinematography and everything in between. This should rightfully be discussed as one of the most important films ever to be made.The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is a spaghetti western that made Clint Eastwood a household name. At the time of its release it was panned by critics for saying it was glorifying war and there was too much violence. At the time the \"spaghetti western\" was looked down upon by critics who grew up with the classic western style. The clean cut hero taking out the no good bad guy; in the case of this film there is a more realistic take on the time period. It is gritty, dirty and despite the name; none of the three main characters are inherently good. Ironically Blondie who is considered \"The Good\" kills the most people on screen with Angel Eyes \"The Bad\" killing the least amount. Now it seems normal to have an anti-hero as the lead of your film, but back then it was new.Like I said before, this film blew Clint Eastwood's career up to a new level, but for me it was someone else who stole the show. Eli Wallach as Tuco is brilliantly done. The dynamic between him and Blondie is entertaining as the ying to his yang. You're not suppose to root for the conniving one consider as \"The Ugly\", but his performance make for a likeable character that falls somewhere in between the good and the bad with one of my favorite lines from him being \"If you're going to talk, talk. If you're going to shoot, shoot.\" Which comes with its own irony as Tuco spends most of the time talking while Blondie communicates with his facial expressions.The film is instantly recognizable from Ennio Morricone's opening score; making for a great introduction to the film, followed by phenomenal introductions of the titled characters with Sergio Leone's captivating direction. The score also plays a big role in the final standoff scene. The silence being overtaken by the music building to invoke tension as each man stands with their hand over their gun. It builds almost until we can't take it anymore, followed by the climax of Blondie shooting Angel Eyes. There are no words uttered during the entirety of this scene, but still it is so engaging that I had to stop the film just out of curiosity of whether Tuco aimed at Blondie or Angel Eyes with his unloaded gun - he aimed at Angel Eyes.One aspect of The Good, The Bad And The Ugly I was not expecting to see was the Civil War. It came as a surprise and played a major theme in this film. It is funny to think now that when the film came out in 1966, critics said it was glorifying war, but I think the contrary. This is one of the few films I've seen where isn't glorified and they don't make either side look good. It shows that everyone is a victim of war, no matter if you're on the winning side or the losing side. I don't know if it was the writers' plan to make an anti-war film, but that is what it comes across as.I am glad I watched this film and I'll most likely sit down and watch it again eventually. This is a must-see film for anyone movie buffs out there or aspiring filmmakers. Even if you're not a big fan of the genre, you'll get something out of it. Although the title can be a bit deceiving because all three characters are outlaws, the argument can be made that Blondie is indeed \"good\" as depicted in a few scene. He's a man who is looking to become rich, but wouldn't hurt or kill someone innocent to make it happen unlike Angel Eyes and Tuco. The Good, The Bad And The Ugly comes highly recommended.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 2}, "heading": "One Of The Most Important Films Ever Made", "date": "2018-10-31T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4430220", "sentiment score": [0.0165, 0.0279, 0.0407, 0.199, 0.7159]}, {"content": "If you haven't seen this before What are you waiting for?

Clint Eastwood is the Good, aka the Man with No Name, a taciturn wanderer who follows his own sense of justice. His opposite is Angel Eyes (Lee van Cleef), the Bad, a brutal mercenary who kills anyone who stands in the way of making ready cash. The film's comic relief is Tuco (Eli Wallach), the Ugly, a Mexican bandit wanted in several states who ends up inadvertently doing some good turns. At the height of the Civil War, as Union and Confederate armies battle each other in the West, these three men vie for an abandoned cache of gold coins.The film is especially memorable for its pace and cinematography. The opening scene, for example, juxtaposes closeups of anxious faces with vast panoramas of the Western landscape, and 10 minutes passes before a single word is said. It's like Tarkovsky transplanted to a vastly different setting. That's not to say it's all so serious, though. In a sense the film is a \"two buddies on the road\" movie, with Tuco the wisecracker and Eastwood's character the straight man. It is also a war film, with Leone apparently sparing no expense in presenting a realistic image of hundreds of men charging each other on the battlefield. This is not among the greatest films I've ever seen, but it's very well-made.Because this is a \"spaghetti Western\", an effort in the genre realized by a joint Italian-Spanish production team with American lead actors, the film has some curious qualities. Because of the use of locals, all the faces of Civil War soldiers are so clearly Italian, even though Italian immigration into the US picked up only later. The Mexican bandit Tuco is played by a Polish Jewish actor from New York, and furthermore Leone mocks the character's Catholicism in a way that Americans of the era would, although the faith would be in no way foreign to his Italian audience.", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "A memorable Western with a peculiar international flair", "date": "2018-09-06T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4324900", "sentiment score": [0.0026, 0.014, 0.1086, 0.674, 0.2009]}, {"content": "My favorite movie of all time is The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. \nMost critics and audiences tend to agree that this movie is exceptional.

There are so many things. I love treasure hunting, I love westerns, and I love the civil war, and the plot manages to seamlessly create a perfect story. The three titular characters are all interesting and beg for your attention from beginning to end. Blondie is a mysterious hero with a cowboy's charisma. He's just so cool that you have to root for him. Tuco delivers comic relief perfectly and his constant change of allegiance keeps me guessing. And finally, Angel Eyes is an impeccable antagonist; a dark, enigmatic hitman who's willing to do anything to get his prize. The three are portrayed perfectly by Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach, and Lee Van Cleef. These are all dynamite performances, and it behooves any actor to study them. \nThe gritty and violent western vibe is heightened in intensity by the backdrop of the civil war, giving it historical significance and a great background for the main characters to interact with. \nAnd let's not forget the music.

It is one of the best western films of all time, in my opinion the best. After this film, Clint Eastwood began to be recognized as an International film star. The film opens with a very familiar theme song composed by Ennio Morricone. I have heard this soundtrack a lot of times in other films, commercials and games. This instrumental soundtrack is one of the most iconic scores in the film history. When this theme song is combined with the presence of Clint Eastwood, as Blondie, it is even more meaningful. After the two films of the trilogy, I became familiar with Sergio Leone and his directing style. He uses extreme facial close-ups to express the feelings of a person without using conversations. He also uses long shots for the same purpose. Just by looking at the face of the actor from up close, you get to understand how he feels. In his films you get to see a lot of silent but expressive scenes. Take the last scene in the cemetery as an example. Before shooting starts, camera moves from one face to another, from one pistol to another. This scene starts with full long body shots and ends with extreme close ups to the eyes. This takes more than 4 minutes, and creates one of the most iconic scene of the film.When I watch a film, I don't pay much attention to the technical details. I like to write about how a film makes me feel and why. But here, it was impossible not to talk about his directing style, which changes the course of the film completely. Once again, the soundtracks including not only the theme song, are all over the story, which makes the audience feel the tense of a particular scene. Sergio Leone is one of the directors who uses soundtracks as a power over the story. With all the struggles during the filming of the trilogy, after \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly,\" he managed to put his name as one of the best directors of all times. The film was made with a budget of $1.2 Million and grossed over $25 Million. While I am writing this review, \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\" stands on the 9th place in IMDB's top 250 films of all times. The story is intense, the performances are amazing and the atmosphere is real. This film has everything that a film must have in order to be considered a masterpiece\"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\" opens with three different scenes, where we get to meet The Ugly, The Bad and The Good respectively. All three scenes take around 30 minutes, and if I haven't counted wrong, a total of 9 people die, three per character. Sergio Leone uses first scenes of his films to introduce us the main characters of his story. He uses this storytelling technique in all his three films. By doing this, he prepares us to the real plot, and creates a credibility over his main characters. The role of The Ugly, Tuco, is played by Eli Wallach. At first, I found this choice surprising, and if I wouldn't have seen the actors, I would have named Gian Maria Volonte, as The Bad, Clint Eastwood as The Good and Lee Van Cleef as The Ugly. But, in the end of the film, I have seen that the casting choices are exactly how they are supposed to be. Tuco is the most distinctive character of the film and Lee Van Cleef couldn't have performed well in this role. In the first two films, Gian Maria Volonte was the main villain of the story. When you look at \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly,\" there is actually no villain in it, therefore it makes sense why he was left out.\"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\" has an easy plot. It is about three gunmen who go after 200K Dollars buried in a cemetery. The story takes place during the Civil War in America. Even though the main characters have nothing to do with it, the story of \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly,\" evolves around the Civil War. The adventures of these gunmen, on their journey to the cemetery, are interrupted a lot of times because of the war. In these scenes, Sergio Leone shows us the real effects of the war on people. Destroyed towns, lost lives and killed people are focus points of the story. It is fascinating, how you get to see the realities of the American Civil War, in an Italian made film. From all points of views, \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\" is a masterpiece which all cinema fans must see.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "They formed an alliance of hate to steal a fortune in dead man's gold.", "date": "2018-08-04T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4268085", "sentiment score": [0.012, 0.0257, 0.0509, 0.2935, 0.6179]}, {"content": "3 hours of suspense, Sergio leone knew what he was doing \nAmazing performances from the actors \nwonderful storyline and the sountracks just wow\nwhata combination!!!!", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Marvellous", "date": "2018-08-02T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4265564", "sentiment score": [0.0121, 0.0131, 0.0427, 0.2208, 0.7113]}, {"content": "Filmed in Spain by Italian filmmaker, this is the best Western ever made.

Their eyes are fixed on the gold.Following \"For a Few Dollars More\" Leone had more money than he should have been allowed and made a gritty masterpiece.Coming off \"Rawhide\" and working cheap for Leone in \"A Fistful of Dollars\" Clint Eastwood proved he could hold the big screen even better than the small one. Eastwood knows how to walk, stand, and generally posture himself to attract the eye. Always an underrated actor, he made the trilogy, not Leone (despite the director's later wry comment that Eastwood had two expressions, one with a hat . . .)Eastwood is \"the good\" in an extremely relative way. Leone's west is a world where towns might as well be different planets in science fiction, they're so separate. And none of them seem to have any law; despite the occasional badge, their law appears to be based on circumstance. And he was probably more right than we realize. This is Blondie's world and he finds intelligent ways to capitalize on it.\"The bad\" is second-string actor Lee van Cleef, coming into his glory. He played an avuncular character in \"For a Few Dollars More\" (not the same character, obviously). Leone tried to get his hooks on several better or better-known actors and got stuck with van Cleef again. Well, that worked out just fine. Bronson might have been excellent, but playing second fiddle to Eastwood might not have been his cup of tea.NY stage actor and movie star Eli Wallach (legendary from this role) is Tuco, \"The Ugly,\" a bandit with no moral compass whatsoever. Wallach's comedy \"How to Steal a Million\" (starring Audrey Hepburn and an unlikely Peter O'Toole) came out also in 1966 and it's interesting to compare his two characters, one a jet-setting businessman and the other an unimaginably dirty western drifter). Oh, and in the scene where he's trying to find the grave, Tuco runs like a girl.They can't make 'em like this anymore.The first hour is character development. Sure, nearly every scene could have been trimmed, but absorbing who the characters are in relation to one another is extremely helpful in understanding their later by-play, especially the bizarre tenderness blossoming between Blondie and Tuco.But Leone never loses the thread of yarn. As he proved in his even more bloated epics \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" (where he dawdles through a credit sequence that is a mini-movie in its own right and longer than most \"short features\") and the pretentious but tedious \"Once Upon a Time in America\", Leone is interested in showing off what he can do with money. He spends as if his movies are government programs: the more he gets, the more ways he can find to waste it. But this is his best use of the dough.The last half-hour, where all the ragged ends begin being sewn together, is the pure joy of film making. From the time they hit the cemetery it's one of the best climaxes in cinema history. This includes the trick Blondie pulls to make sure while \"Angel Eyes\" has to watch out for two opponents in the three-way duel, Blondie only has to worry about one.The Good: 1) Ennio Morricone's legendary score. The movie's theme is rightfully iconic, and I love his \"Ecstasy of Gold\" (I'm a sucker for bells). His score also has foreshadowing of his delicate work in \"The Mission\" in the 1980s. 2) Clint Eastwood. While Eastwood's flicks as director are strangely humorless, Eastwood's wry humor and charm shine through. 3) Lee van Cleef. While no one's first choice for a costar, van Cleef seems to realize this is his moment and he makes the most of it, becoming one of the most slyly despicable baddies in westerns. 4) Eli Wallach. While I'm tempted to move him to \"the bad\" for stealing almost every shot he's in, his performance is good . . . If tiring when the movie his watched repeatedly. Wallach did not know how to dial Tuco back; neither did Leone who, I guess, decided to get full value for money. Eastwood can express more with a flick of his cigar, and van Cleef with an etebrow, than Wallach for all his overacting. 5) Spain. Franco, the one fascist dictator not targeted in WW2, ran an oppressive regime, but one where filmmakers found they could get anything they wanted for a well-placed bribe. The long shots of the land do resemble the never-never land of the old west, and they have their own stark beauty. Just as one can't go wrong with Tuscany, it's difficult to make this part of Spain look bad on film (Lean even used it in the second half of his magnificently watchable \"Lawrence of Arabia\").The Ugly: Leone. His closeups of unattractive actors, his meaningless tracking shots, the very overwhelming bloat that might so easily, as in his \"Once Upon a Time . . .\" movies, might have gone woefully amiss.Overall, a good story well acted by the three leads. Leone was never this good before and he was too much of a glutton to restrain his bloat afterward. This was everyone's moment. A wonderful film . . . But long.

With a lot of close ups, gorgeous landscape cinematography & stylish drawn out tenseful gunfights all of Leone's trademarks are clearly visible. Yet why is The Good, the Bad and the Ugly even better than his other masterpieces? The three main characters are ofcourse the stars of this show, with each putting in an exceptional performance, especially Eli Wallach as the eccentric bandit Tuco. Clint Eastwood & Lee van Cleef's natural acting talent show that there is no need for useless dialogue to insult the viewers intelligence, facial acting is an even more impressive kind of acting, and with van Cleef and Eastwood, they had the two best in the business. The little dialogue also gives the viewer a chance to listen to the absolutely incredible musical orchestrations by Ennio Morricone, which is always in a natural kind of harmony to Leone's direction skills, resulting in absolutely graceful scenes that delight the eyes. The dialogue that is there always seems to further the story or enhance character development ( specifically in Tuco's case ), and not insult the viewers intelligence. It even includes a parody on one of the most common Hollywood clich\u00e9s when Tuco says: 'When you have to shoot, shoot. Don't talk!'.Unlike Leone's previous films The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is set during the American civil war between the Union and Confederacy, and a lot of small subplots feature this war. Leone shows a sarcastic view on the purposelessness of the civil war in this film by putting the three main characters in its midst while maintaining its own personal story about greed. The alcoholic Union captain shows this perfectly, with his fed up view about the brutality and the senseless deaths of the civil war, or Angel Eyes's trip through a confederate hospital showing all the wounded as Morricone's dramatic music plays. As for morals, we see the nametags of the title of the movie added to the three characters, yet don't really see all three of them as more than common thugs at the start of the movie. However, the civil war changes this, showing Blondie a man of compassion when faced with a dying soldier, to whom he shares his cigar. A little gesture of great moral worth. Also showing Angel Eyes's indifference with his stolen identity as a fake Union sergeant only to further his own personal greedy agenda. Tuco is shown after the meeting with his brother to be forced into the way he is now, and even though he is a vulgar, dirty, ugly ( no pun intended ) character Leone manages to make him likeable when he is influenced by greed. Thus one of the greatest decisions Leone made was having the setting during the civil war, as its part in this story further enhances character development and brings up questions about the senselessness of it all. The blowing up of the bridge could be seen as the greatest ironic statement of Leone against war.Yet the primary story still consists of finding gold in a certain cemetery, as a personal study of greed. This concept alone might not seem so spectacular, but Ennio Morricone's haunting score, the beautiful desert landscape cinematography, stylish gunfights and the brilliant acting results in an incredible primary story aswell. It is one of the films with some of the greatest final 15-20 minutes ever put to screen, resulting in a large payoff deserving of such a quality film. In the end we truly begin to understand why the tags 'Good', 'Bad' and 'Ugly' are stated in the beginning of the film, as all of the characters have evolved to their respective states during the affairs in the civil war. This is excluding Angel Eyes, who is shown to be evil, dressed in black, from the start, but that makes sense since Leone wanted to show the differences between the three characters in a morality contest during the film, and as Blondie and Tuco changed, Angel Eyes had to be different from them.All of this cements The Good, the Bad and the Ugly as one of the greatest films ever made, and the greatest western ever made, since it tackles so many different kind of themes. It is one of the greatest pieces of entertainment, yet also tackling morality problems and making anti-war statements.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 5}, "heading": "One of the greatest movies of all time", "date": "2018-05-03T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4152904", "sentiment score": [0.0055, 0.0258, 0.1209, 0.6088, 0.239]}, {"content": "A lesson of cinema, the whole western movie at his best in a single master piece.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Simply the best spaghetti western", "date": "2018-05-01T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4150198", "sentiment score": [0.0077, 0.0107, 0.0643, 0.3582, 0.5591]}, {"content": "This is one of my favorite films and is one of the most well crafted westerns and movies in history!", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "One of the favorites!", "date": "2018-04-23T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4139909", "sentiment score": [0.0007, 0.0006, 0.0014, 0.0183, 0.979]}, {"content": "One of the best movies in the genre of all time.

And a moment in a cemetery when a man materializes out of thin air even though he should have been visible for a mile. And the way men walk down a street in full view and nobody is able to shoot them, maybe because they are not in the same frame with them.Leone cares not at all about the practical or the plausible, and builds his great film on the rubbish of Western movie cliches, using style to elevate dreck into art. When the movie opened in America in late 1967, not long after its predecessors \"A Fistful of Dollars\" (1964) and \"For a Few Dollars More\" (1965), audiences knew they liked it, but did they know why?I saw it sitting in the front row of the balcony of the Oriental Theatre, whose vast wide screen was ideal for Leone's operatic compositions. I responded strongly, but had been a movie critic less than a year, and did not always have the wisdom to value instinct over prudence. Looking up my old review, I see I described a four-star movie but only gave it three stars, perhaps because it was a \"spaghetti Western\" and so could not be art.But art it is, summoned out of the imagination of Leone and painted on the wide screen so vividly that we forget what marginal productions these films were--that Clint Eastwood was a Hollywood reject, that budgetary restraints ($200,000 for \"Fistful\") caused gaping continuity errors, that there wasn't a lot of dialogue because it was easier to shoot silent and fill the soundtrack with music and effects. There was even a pathetic attempt to make the films seem more American; I learn from the critic Glenn Erickson that Leone was credited as \"Bob Robertson\" in the early prints of \"Fistful,\" and composer Ennio Morricone, whose lonely, mournful scores are inseparable from the films, was \"Dan Savio.\" Even Eastwood's character, the famous Man With No Name, was an invention of the publicists; he was called Joe in the first movie, Manco in the second, and Blondie in the third.Perhaps it is the subtly foreign flavor of the spaghetti trilogy, and especially the masterpiece \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,\" that suggests the films come from a different universe than traditional Westerns. Instead of tame Hollywood extras from central casting, we get locals who must have been hired near the Spanish locations--men who look long-weathered by work and the sun. Consider the legless beggar who uses his arms to propel himself into a saloon, shouting, \"Hand me down a whiskey!\"John Ford made Monument Valley the home turf of his Western characters, and he made great films there, but there is something new and strange about Leone's menacing Spanish vistas. We haven't seen these deserts before. John Wayne has never been here.

It's an epic, the wide frame capturing both the sweeping vistas of war-torn America and the weary lines snaking across the faces of its seedy inhabitants, and it's masterfully helmed throughout. Another big draw of the long-winded narrative - which loses all but a modicum of its steam when the feature takes an extended detour into an admittedly visually stunning yet narratively unnecessary large-scale battle just before the final confrontation - is the amorality of the three equally charismatic leads, the titular labelling of whom is thankfully rather arbitrary (given that Eastwood's nameless protagonist is awarded the 'good' moniker 28-minutes in after he's just left a man for dead in the middle of the desert), and their constant double-crosses and back-stabs makes for an interestingly unpredictable ride.

Sergio Leones masterpiece. \nWhy do I feel like writing the 841th review on this movie would change something? I don't know. \nMaybe it's just the feeling of having to publicly show my love for this film.\nSaying that \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\" is a good film is a massive understatement. It is the best Western Movie ever made; But not just that. It is one of the best Movies ever made, period. The story is built and executed so perfectly that you don't even notice that the whole complex plot is just a simple storyline following three guys, each of them with different character traits than the other, chasing treasure. Yes, indeed, it is as easy as that. But how can a movie, with such a simple story, last nearly three hours? This is what makes \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\" so great. 179 minutes of screen time, but it never drags. There is no confidence in exactly knowing what is going to happen next. From the tough beginning, through the epic three way showdown. The time in between is paved with delightful bits of story telling, combined with classic, smooth and cool Western obligatory. The perfect mix of beautiful visuals and sadistic violence and brutality. I sadly didn't had the honor to see it in the theater/cinema but even on a TV screen the landscape is still one of the most beautiful sceneries in any motion picture. The violence is tough and of course there are lots of brutal death/fight scenes, but they are never distasteful. The humor is brilliant and the laughs keep coming although they are never fully essential. The movie score is up there with the best music scores in any other movie and it fits the movie greatly.\"The Man With No Name\" is one of the best and iconic movie characters of all time. And Although I think there could be an argument made for Al Pacino's Michael Corleone in \"The Godfather\" as the best antihero in cinema history, \"Blondie\" takes the cake. \n\"The Man With No Name, played brilliantly by Clint Eastwood is no hero. He has not the moral integrity of a hero, but he is a man of honor and respect. That makes him a character more relatable to, as we (as normal humans) probably also aren't heroes the way society in general wants us to be. \nIt's especially \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\" that establishes the co-work of Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood as one if the best, if not the best actor/director relationship along. That should not take away from the rest of the cast. Lee Van Cleef's \"The Bad\"/Sentenza is again, the perfect antagonist and Eli Wallach's \"Tuco\" just fits perfectly as the \"third wheel\". It's a tale about three men, that so often had the opportunity to kill each other, but never did that until the epic culmination.\nThree guys just starring at each other and waiting for the other one's move; Priceless.If you read this review and now think 'Okay, this is a generic spaghetti western flick, with maybe some cool characters and visuals' you are so wrong. \nThis would be like saying that \"The Dark Knight\" (2008) is a generic superhero movie, although it's NOT. Of course the movie's primary \"use\" is too be exciting, funny and gripping, but sometimes, there is just more to it than we think.\nSergio Leone brilliantly captures the cruel and pointless destructions of war. \nThe movie shows that the war has no mercy, but in the end the war helps nobody. The melancholic atmosphere when \"Blondie\" and \"Tuco\" walk through the dead bodies, or the huge size of the cemetery just imply that. \n\"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\" is a chess game, with little dialogue, but with so many iconic one liners that explain more than some overly long stretched dialogue. The most striking thing about the film is it's moral context. The way it presents each 3 characters but doesn't want to honestly separate all of them into \"good\" and \"evil\". It could be argued that \"The Good\" is \"The Bad's\" opponent. But who says that \"The Good\" is really 'good'? And what does \"The Ugly\" do, when there is already someone 'evil'? In fact, exactly this lawlessness and honesty describes and characterizes the film and perfectly develops all three characters. \"There are two kinds of people in the world, my friend.\"\nSumming up, \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\" is a perfectly paced, nearly flawless western classic, with unforgettable scenery, music score and characters.

For the rest : this is riveting, blistering, intoxicating viewing. Propelled by greed, three rogues go their criminal way amidst a moral landscape which seems to have been designed by Hieronymus Bosch at his most pessimistic. They live in a world where cruelty is king and where the kind and innocent have \"VICTIM\" tattooed on their forehead. (For clarity's sake, the \"Good\" from the title can only be called good if one puts the bar for virtue really low - think World Championship Limbo Dancing.) It would be tempting to think of that world as \"lawless\", but the problem runs even deeper. The story plays against the background of the Civil War, with the South fighting for the continuation of slavery. The South has laws defending the idea that it's okay for you to drag inoffensive humans from their countries and homes and work them to death while you sit on the porch and admire the butterflies. This is violence enshrined by law and supported by society ; it is a different beast than, say, individual acts of transgression by reprobates or renegades living outside the system. And the Southerners aren't the only ones who find it difficult to recognize the humanness of others : this is a universe where people can be insulted, mistreated or killed simply because someone somewhere doesn't like one of their characteristics, for whatever reason.This must be one of the most knowing, most disillusioned Westerns ever made. It depicts the nightmare face of the conquest of the West : a seething, grotesque mass of greed and avarice, propelled by dreams of an El Dorado which may, or may not, lie behind the next mountain. Leone's movie paints unforgettable images in the viewer's mind. I, for one, have never been able to hear the words \"Mexican standoff\" without hearing that famous music and seeing that famous scene. And I'm not the only one : the scene is one of the most influential and iconic in Western movies, and rightly so. It's a work of art : inventively filmed, superbly choreographed, and both stark and over-the-top operatic.

The story of three gunslingers who hate, love and torture each other to find fortune in a cemetery, while avoiding chaos of the American Civil War, is one of my favorite of all time.I have watched this movie, regardless of the amount of violence, with great pleasure. This film captures you in almost three hours.During the American Civil War, mercenary Angel Eyes interrogates a former Confederate soldier. A frightened soldier has discovered, in order to stay alive, to a dangerous mercenary a secret about a cache of Confederate gold. Meanwhile, Mexican bandit Tuco is rescued from three bounty hunters by \"Blondie\", a taciturn and enigmatic loner, who delivers him to a local sheriff to collect his bounty. It seems, that they are partners in a lucrative money-making scheme, however, these partnerships in the wild west almost always last for a very short time. Blondie grows weary of Tuco's complaints, and abandons him penniless in the desert. Tuco's revenge is brutal. Blondie life was saved by man with a secret of buried gold. The two carry on a portion of the secrets of buried gold, however, the third player, who wants to join, waiting in ambush...Regardless of wartime background and some bizarre elements, this is a realistic view of violent, brutal and fanatical relations in the West. The title is a phrase of an ironic attitude, which is even more pronounced through three close characters which are trying to get hold of a hidden treasure, while thousands of people dying around them. It is impossible to remain indifferent to this film, given the cruelty, sharp dialogues and the wit that pervades through the general madness, which borders with an apocalypse.The scenery is simply amazing, characterization is excellent, despite the fact that two of the three characters remain mystical. Well, the soundtrack .... the soundtrack is a masterpiece. Morricone's magic in the true sense of the word.Clint Eastwood as \"Blondie\" (a.k.a. the Man with No Name) became a true symbol of the genre after this film. His facial expressions, cigarette and specific way of speaking somewhat borders with trash and again becomes an essential part of the film culture. Blondie is definitely not a \"good\" character, he is only smarter, more patient and quicker on the trigger.Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes is a ruthless, unfeeling, and sociopathic mercenary who always finishes his job. He creates a certain counterbalance with his charisma, attitude and cruelties. Angel Eyes is antagonist, which has maybe a little \"different\" approach in order to achieve his objective, as opposed to the main protagonists.Eli Wallach as Tuco has stole the show, as a dirty, arrogant, sore, but very capable outlaw. His fanaticism exceeds all reasonable limits. He has no right to make mistakes, because he walks through a thin wire between two completely opposite characters.It is difficult to distinguish between good and evil, generosity and cruelty or luck and coincidence in this film.

Because If you haven't seen one of those films before, there is an intimidating side of them, you just feel apprehensive. To an outsider, they all look similar, as if every image you have seen about any western film belongs to one single film. They look kind of boring. And now that I have seen this film, I can tell that it was a great experience. Of course, I cannot make general statements about the genre just because I've seen one film. But seeing this broke my prejudice. And even if you feel like you can never enjoy western, you should make an exception to see this one. Having said that, I must warn you it is a slow burner. First half hour was a challenge for me, but after that it started to get interesting. So I advice patience.I also want to say a few things about the film itself. I don't know a lot of actors from old films, this may be the first time I've watched Eli Wallach. He is great in this film. It was his performance that caught my attention for the film after the aforementioned difficult half hour. I can't tell the same thing about Clint Eastwood though. I don't know if it was part of the character or something, but his acting consisted of a lot of squinting, grimacing and whispering his dialog in a monotonous speech. Story was the strongest part of the film, it reminded me of Quentin Tarantino's films, though it is not a coincidence, Tarantino is known to be influenced by a lot of western films and he named many of them as his favorites. But the dialogue is not as powerful and interesting as Tarantino's, though it is not a weakness of the film either. The main plot is complicated in the most positive way and there are a lot of details that touches your heart, like when Tuco meets with his brother and the Union Captain that wanted to hear that bridge blown up before he passes.I don't think I should talk much about Ennio Morricone's music. It is just awesome and the soundtrack is so iconic it is recognized by almost everybody regardless whether they've seen the film or not. Such a powerful music, it gives you an adrenaline rush.I am pretty sure I'll re-watch this film many times again. And because of this film, I might delve into other westerns. And I'll also look into Eli Wallach's filmography for I am much impressed with his performance.One last thing, a bizarre sensation came upon me during watching the film. I wonder if these films will get more and more irrelevant and even awkward perhaps for the future audiences. When some guy from the year, say, 3017 watches this, will he feel utterly perplexed?

This Western has everything, and that's why in some quarters it is regarded as the best one ever made. Arguably it took Eastwood until 'Unforgiven' to make a film that even comes close to this one.

Of course, none of these men trust each other and the Civil War happens to be raging around them.There's no question that Leone created a different filmic genre by melding the hysterically overdone Italo grand opera with Spanish picaresque convention. A Spanish term, Picaro means \"rogue\" or \"rascal\", and the picaresque yarn is usually sardonic, featuring the misadventures of roguish protagonists of low stature who live by their wits in a crooked world, and told with realistic and humorous detail. Here 'Blondie' (Eastwood) and Tuco (Wallach) are the two picaros, who have stumbled upon a way to make good money claiming bounty rewards for Tuco's many sins.Someone criticized the film on the grounds that the geography doesn't look anything like the actual landscapes where these Civil War events occurred. Wrong. The events in the film take place in extreme West Texas and the New Mexican Territory. \"Santa Fe\" is even mentioned a couple of times. When Angel Eyes meets Baker, his employer, near the beginning it's in El Paso, which is 250 miles south of Santa Fe. The topography of Almer\u00eda, Spain, is an acceptable geographical substitute.Admittedly this Spaghetti Western is overrated, overlong and has some slow stretches, not to mention amoral & one-dimensional characters and a story that idolizes lucre above everything; it also has campy and goofy elements, which kills any realism. But, if you can handle all that, Eastwood is the coolest Westerner, Lee Van Cleef is the ultimate bad axx, the exceptional score by Ennio Morricone is iconic and the film pulsates with hip style (for 1966, that is). In short, there's some good in this movie, even greatness, which explains the ridiculous gushing of some reviewers; but, let's be honest, there's also some bad and ugly.Director Leone strained to explain the theme: \"We all have some bad in us, some ugliness, some good. And there are people who appear to be ugly, but when we get to know them better, we realize that they are more worthy.\" One reviewer took this and claimed that each of the three protagonists embody the three parts of human nature with Tuco representing the id (i.e. the \"flesh\") and Blondie representing the ego (i.e. the mind with its power of volition). Okay, that fits. But then he tried to argue that Angel Eyes (Van Cleef) represents the superego, which goes to show that he didn't understand this structural model of the psyche seeing as how the superego is the idealistic, heroic side of human nature (aka the \"spirit\") and Angel Eyes in the movie is anything BUT.The film runs 163 minutes (the version I viewed) and was shot in Burgos, Granada, Almer\u00eda & Colmenar Viejo, Spain, with interiors done in Rome. The screenplay was written by Leone & Luciano Vincenzoni with the additions of Agenore Incrocci & Furio Scarpelli.GRADE: B-", "rating": 6, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 8}, "heading": "There's some good in this movie, even greatness, but also some bad and ugly", "date": "2017-06-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3726269", "sentiment score": [0.0263, 0.1671, 0.3958, 0.3694, 0.0414]}, {"content": "There is a reason The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is considered one of the all-time-bests in so many lists.

The Bad tries to get money at all costs, no matter how cruel or cold, he would kill anybody and probably wouldn't share anything with anyone - So he represents the bad side in people. The Good is not talking much. The Good always shares his money no matter what, he may use the system to his advantage but his intent is not to kill anyone, but he wouldn't back off of doing the necessary evil, you see the line between Good and Bad already gets confusing. He probably uses the money to do some good (thats at least my Theory - we don't know for sure) - Therefore he represents the good side in people. The Ugly displays so many different human emotions and sides, he may as well be my favourite character in this truly magnificent movie. In one moment he is your friend and ally, in another he tries to kill you or just torture you. He is always interested in money, guns, alcohol and action.

Well since the North wants to end slavery they have good intentions, I agree with that. But are the soldiers fighting for the Sourth bad, or just brave?

The Good gives a dying Confederate soldier a smoke of his cigar and his jacket, showing respect and strength at the same time.

In the case of \"The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly\", however, the meandering plot is only part of the overall experience.For a basic plot summary, this movie is about three Civil War-era members of the \"Old West\" who are racing for a stash of hidden gold. Blondie (Clint Eastwood) is the \"strong but silent\" type, Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) is rotten to the core, and Tuco (Eli Wallach) is the scumbag that everyone loves to hate.As far as the plot of the film is concerned, that is about all that needs to be said. It is the simplest of all possible premises and manages to meander its way to a three-hour runtime. Usually, I criticize films like this that don't \"get to the point\" a little quicker, but in this case I hardly noticed the diversions. The reasons? Everything else in the movie is so expertly crafted!For example:-Casting: Van Cleef was born to play the mean gunslinger, I've never seen a better role from Wallach, and I had forgotten (after watching many of his newer films) just how good Eastwood could be in a western. -Tension/Pacing: Even at three hours in length, the film manages to perfectly pace itself. The tension grows and grows as the gold gets closer and closer. -Music: Besides boasting a main theme that is now so iconic it probably gets overused in parody, the sound effects and when little bleats of music are actually used are even more important. Director Sergio Leone almost uses the music of the film as sort of another character in and of itself (complete with human-like attributes of humor and drama). -\"Feel\": While unabashedly a \"western\", \"GBU\" doesn't look like a typical entry in the genre. This isn't your John Wayne \"saddle up pilgrim\" type of movie. It is called a \"spaghetti western\" (due to its genre roots in Italy), in which visuals, music, and atmosphere are used to tell the story as much as words. While the original entries in what is now known as the \"Man with No Name Trilogy\" are a bit too sparse (IMHO), this one strikes a perfect balance between \"actions and words\".Overall, director Leone created a masterpiece with \"The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly\". It is a different type of film-making, to be sure, but one that is brimming with tension.

Nothing is superfluous and the viewer is rapt. The use of comedy in key parts only serves the darkness feeling as if spawned out of need. The perfection in story, acting, and cinematography gels so seamlessly there is never a second letdown.

As I start to get in to the western for the carnival here (the European version of the Halloween and it takes place in late Febuary) I began with this trilogy and the final was pitch perfect.For starter the set up is simply brilliant so we have our three protagonists Blondie (Clint Eastwood) the \"Good\", Tuco (Eli Wallach) the \"Ugly\" and finally the trio is filled by Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) the \"Bad\".And all of them have found out that a known criminal has died and left a huge sum of money somewhere buried and they try to find it out either alone, allying ,dubble-croshing each other in the this hunt. What I loved with the film is the that Mr. Leone with the opening this shows it who is who but because here it isn't the old western ,but a spaghetti one the famous moral ambiguity comes in. You see the \"Good\" is in reality a real jackass to his colleagues, the \"Ugly\" though he lack the looks of the other two ,he is quit smart and damn him he is a charismatic man and finally the \"Bad\" , he is an officer in the Northen army during the Civil War, which means he works technically with the \"good guys\" of history. Man, in the end everyone of them has a contradiction with his title by the director.The movie though it is two hours and three quarters of an hour long feels like an ancient Greek epic poem ,with the adventures of our protagonists (not heroes), the gun-fights and even the quotes are epic \"When you have to shoot ,shoot don't talk\", \"You see my friend there two kinds of people in this world those who... and those who...\". In general the cynicism about the ethical bed rocks like religion, government and even justice is mocked with a truly smart way. The reason why the spaghetti westerns managed to bring this criticism was that the tides of the era of the sixties, during which the majority of them came out, was the period of the Hipies movement, the anti-war, anti-establishment and in general the opposition against the base lines of the then society. So was it out of chance that the most stereotypical stories about gunmen , were re-imagined back then like that? Surely no.All in all the whole trilogy in general is worth watching and analyzing even though the first one was a \"remake\" (copy ) of the Japanese film Yojimbo, but we all know that nowadays are we? ;)!", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 4}, "heading": "One of the best films in history and with an EPIC Score!!", "date": "2017-02-04T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3633006", "sentiment score": [0.013, 0.0641, 0.1966, 0.4798, 0.2466]}, {"content": "Not only do I believe that Sergio Leone's 1966 masterpiece, 'The Good the Bad and the Ugly' is the greatest spaghetti western off all time, I would argue that it is also the greatest movie ever put to the big screen. With an iconic soundtrack, memorable characters, fantastic cinematography, and the most climactic and fitting ending to the dollars trilogy, 'The Good the Bad and the Ugly' shines above and beyond any movie I have seen before or since.The movie opens introducing it's villain Angel-eyes, to the audience and immediately actor Lee Van Cleef creates a presence of intimidation and power without even speaking a single line of dialog. In the next scene, we meet the selfish middle man Tuco, played by Eli Wallach, who is without a doubt putting every inch of his being trying to make his character authentic and is clearly loving every second of it. As a result, he is the funniest aspect of the movie, without turning into a simple side/comic relief character. His character is one that goes through the most pain and suffering as shown when we learn about his shaky relationship with his family and an incredibly gruesome torture scene that is able to shock audiences even now, fifty years later.Finally we are introduced to the lead man Blondie, played by legendary actor and future director Clint Eastwood. Eastwood's presence is the most phenomenal thing to witness on screen as he is (and believe me, there is no other way to describe him) just the coolest man who ever lived. He doesn't even need to try to look cool like most actors will do, he just seems naturally prepared for any situation. No matter what surprises are thrown at him, he just seems able to shrug it off almost like it doesn't bother him. This doesn't bring the movie down however, due to the audience believing he cannot die through his endless confidence, instead it feels more like he has accepted the dangerous world he lives and acknowledges that he can die at any second, yet it does not face or scare him, making him both an incredibly respectable and entertaining character simultaneously.The movie's story and script is another thing about it that is just awe inspiring. Despite the basic plot of three men on a treasure hunt, the movie throws in elements of the events that actually were affecting the world they inhabit at the time, the American Civil War. Whether being captured and imprisoned by one side or ending up even enlisting into one of the armies, the men never forget their true goals and ambitions. While the plot gets side tracked, the characters don't and the war ends up becoming just another obstacle for them to overcome. Also, because these characters stay so true to form, we are able to observe and take in some of the best suited and interesting dialog possible. Watching these three completely different personalities talk, fight, and betray each other is so excellently executed and seamless, you almost forget that these men are factious.Where the movie really shines however is in it's cinematography and soundtrack. While I could talk about every single scene here, instead I shall focus on one in particular where both are used to their absolute best. After deciding to double-cross Blondie, Tuco flees and discovers the graveyard where the gold is buried. What ensues is the greatest scene in the movie, where Tuco stands up and begins to run around the yard, trying to locate the grave with the hidden gold. The song that plays is called 'the Ecstasy of Gold' and, as the name suggests, it perfectly encapsulates the climactic tension that the movie has been building up to as Tuco almost madly runs around for the grave. Every now and then, the scene will cut to a new shot, showing the situation from \"the Ugly's\" perspective. To simulate his running, the camera starts to spin, slowly at first, then quickens and quickens to show Tuco's desperation for the gold he yearns until a sudden halt of the spinning motion, causing the viewer to feel as dazed and confused as the character does in his state of potential madness.There are many different 'cuts' of this flawless film, all with different run times and prolonged/shortened scenes, the most common one being the longest with a run time of 173 minutes. This should not by any circumstances put off any film buff or fan of cinema as despite this hefty length, the ending is well worth the wait and while slow at times in the middle, still keeps the viewer's intrigue enough to make them want to watch it to the very end. Casual movie goers however may want to prefer to search for a shorter cut of the movie if this more common run time is a little too much for them to handle.A movie that has stood the test of time strongly and firmly, being now just over fifty years old.

For those who actually care about the history of film: * Leone invented a brand new genre called the Italian western. His first, Fistful of Dollars, recycled a Japanese story (Yojimbo), recycled an American ex-pat whose Hollywood career was officially over (Eastwood) and introduced one of the greatest music composers of the modern film era, Ennio Morricone.* next came For a Few Dollars More, an original story, which locked into film history Leone's trademark use of closeups and sound editing, and brought out of mothballs Lee Van Cleef, one of the greatest \"faces\" in the history of the western. (\"Angel Eyes\" in this one.) * with two international hits under his belt, Leone aimed for the stars and created this movie which marks his legacy. While simultaneously continuing the tradition he started, and using the two stars from his second film, he gave Eli Wallach (an A-list star from the 1950s) the role of his career. Wait there is more. He set the story against the backdrop of the Civil War and manged to make the transitions seamless and brutally compelling. it is simultaneously a violent film and an anti-war film at the same time! (The only film of Leone's that may compete with this one is Once Upon a Time in America, also reviewed by this writer on the IMDb).By modern standards the film is overlong and, had it been produced in America (as was indeed the case with Upon a Time in America), the \"suits\" would have butchered it down to 100 minutes. Luckily for the rest of us, this was an international release, cut-proof, and survives very nicely to the present day in its original form.QT was a young lad when these films appeared but the impact is clear. He used Morricone's music in Kill Bill (his best film in my view) and in my view The Hateful Eight tries to emulate the power of Leone but falls somewhat short.For you youngsters out there, I recommend these films as some of the most entertaining efforts ever set to film, period.

Unfortunately, THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is sometimes overlooked in place of that film, and although it's only the third of a trilogy, the film still has an epic feel to it.This film's main benefit over the previous two is Ennio Morricone's score. While his music was very good in A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE, here it becomes the stuff of legend and one of most recognised western tunes ever written; it's also by and far Morricone's best ever work, to this day. Leone retains the solid Eastwood from the previous two films and also brings back Lee Van Cleef, this time playing a bad guy (unfortunately - I prefer his heroes to his villains as I like the guy). Most screen time, though, is given to THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN's Eli Wallach, who is also excellent as the wanted criminal Tuco, a man who lives by his wits and courage and isn't afraid to take risks.Eastwood plays his role to perfection, as he should with so much practice. He gets to say some well-remembered lines such as \"There are two kinds of people in this world, my friend...\" Van Cleef is exceptionally evil and sadistic as the villain of the piece, my only complaint is that he has relatively little screen time in comparison to the other two main stars and thus feels slightly underused. Also appearing are some familiar faces like Luigi Pistilli and Rada Rassimov.The plot is a wider and more political one than before, as it shows how the Civil War intruded upon the quiet serenity of the Old West. The brief battle scenes we do see are sweeping and epic, up there with the best put on film. Leone's direction is stylish and a work of genius, and he serves up a number of odd, memorable situations. These include a shoot-out in a bombed town, complete with blackened smoking ruins; an ingenious way to remove handcuffs; and the blowing up of a bridge. The scene is also set for one of the best sequences in cinema; the confrontation between Wallach, Van Cleef, and Eastwood in the cemetery at the film's end. Here, the music, quick photography (close-ups of people's eyes, etc.) and acting combine to make this one of the coolest, most tense showdowns in history.

Yet again however , alliances fail with Tuco escaping his Yankee captor and Blondie staying defensive of Angel Eyes, fully aware of his dangerous potential. Tuco meets up gain with Blondie in a small town where they together kill angel eyes's men, with Angel eyes escaping and the pair making off together in pursuit of the gold. before they reach the cemetery the final hurdle for the Good and the Ugly comes with them running into the heart of the civil war, the bridge over the river is the final obstacle with fierce fighting taking place in order to protect it, so Blondie and Tuco go forth and destroy it after they agree to tell each other's part of the secret, which cemetery and which grave, yet once across the river Tuco makes a break for it, but the composed Blondie with Classic Eastwood cool again meets up with Tuco at the supposed grave site, where too Angel eyes again appears making for an epic showdown in the centre of the cemetery over discovering the name of the grave, with Blondie being the only one with actual knowledge of said grave. The epic showdown accompanied with the epic score of Ennino Moriconne to back it up like was done throughout the film, see's angel eyes taken down by the quick drawing Blondie and Tuco again beaten by Blondie who emptied Tuco's gun barrel the night before, allowing for Blondie to be the one with all the advantage. the final scene is where Blondie with gold on horseback with Tuco strung up in a tree like he did to Blondie, Blondie like he always has done shoots the rope freeing Tuco for the last time to have his share of the money and to have Blondie ride off into the distance unbeaten and victorious. The 3hr long epic is to this day one of the best ever films and one of if not the best western ever made, it was made in the golden era of westerns which extended into the 70's with other classics many of which starred Eastwood himself. The actors, the writing, the filming and the music all make for the most unforgettable western ever made and like i said, despite its age, and the quality of film at the time, everything about this film all the way down to the sets and costumes is accurate to the time portrayed in the film and holds up against modern films and indeed modern westerns. after watching the film many times over it is fair to say they simply don't make movies like this anymore, movies with character, movies that are in so many ways imaginative and inventive in style and structure, the acting and scenarios never seem forced the actors never seem insincere and the tone of the film is entirely engaging throughout the film. the greatest scene of course is the final shootout, but like most westerns it is the proper conclusion of the film, though you may think it typical, i guarantee the final scene is anything but typical, it is dramatic it is tense and the music that carry's it completely immerses you into the fear and focus of the characters and I personally believe that few other westerns achieve such an intense and engaging finale and indeed an intense and engaging film throughout.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 4}, "heading": "Masterful, immersive, and showing off all that is cool about a western with a bit of Eastwood swagger.", "date": "2016-07-09T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3501397", "sentiment score": [0.0073, 0.0373, 0.206, 0.5667, 0.1827]}, {"content": "I first saw this when i was 5 years old. 13 years later and many viewings later, it still blows me away. Let's just give you the numbers and letters that you want. 10/10 A+ 5 stars Two thumbs up etc. etc. This is a masterpiece. A film so brilliantly epic focusing on insignificant characters of the West. Not only is it the greatest Western film of all time, it could easily be regarded as THE best film of all time by some. But let's get into it.The story and characters. Both are simple. Very simple. And that's not a problem. From this movie we get the three typical characters; the bad guy, the funny man and the bad-ass \"good guy\". Each are unique in their simplistic way and have great chemistry between each other. The interactions between Blondie and Tuco on their adventure always sparks dark humour and Angel Eyes always has a sinister presence on screen. Their introductions to the audience are amazing, especially that of Angel Eyes, and they continue to be be lasting, memorable characters long after the film is finished. The story is a simple \"three men going after the same gold\" plot, but quickly grows into a Western epic as they travel around the open deserts, through towns, pulled into the bloody civil war and appropriately finishes in a graveyard. This entire epic adventure all occurred because of a simple treasure hunt plot. The movie therefore exceeds in providing great, memorable characters, and a simple plot that creates an epic adventure through the wild west.The acting is great. Eastwood pulls off his best bad-ass role as Blondie, whenever appearing on screen. His presence within the film gives off this almost demigod-like character that roams the west - truly awesome. Eli Wallach is also great as the rude, dirty and humorous Tuco, who provides the bulk of the comedy in the film, especially when interacting with Eastwood. Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes is also superb, truly pulling off a great villain. He's calm, ruthless and brutal and always has a presence when he's in the shot, standing out with his piercingly calm eyes. Each character has great dialogue, with memorable phrases and one-liners and each have their moment in the film to shine. Their personalities, dialogue and looks, portrayed by a great cast, provides some of the coolest, most unique characters ever put to film.The cinematography in this movie is astounding. Leone as a director is exceptional, always favouring the extreme long shots to get a feel for the location. The film is continuously breathtaking with its large, epic shots that capture the beauty of the west. Every frame of this film, is indeed a painting. Not only is the cinematography exceptional in the travelling and dialogue sequences of the film, it also excels in its action segments. A variety of long sweeping shots and precise close ups to eyes and guns brilliantly conveys tension in these scenes. Nothing is boring, everything is riveting. The quick cuts are never done during the action, but only leading up to it to effectively build the atmosphere of the showdowns, which are shot in a way in which doesn't confuse the audience and prominently displays the violence of the film. It feels gritty and real mixed with the myth-like invincibility of the main characters that lead them through showdowns and war-scale battles to a final showdown of epic proportions. It really gives the film an epic scale and never shies away from the drama and violence within the film, effectively capturing action and character emotions to portray a brilliant visual story.And how can I not talk about the score. Ennio Morricone, my favourite composer and easily one of the best, provides an astounding western score to solidify this film into history. It's epic and atmospheric and fits the movie so well. The movie's theme is brilliant and iconic, unique and memorable earning its place with the likes of Jaws, Star Wars and Terminator. Morricone's score fits in beautifully with the excellent cinematography, which really helps to further add to the atmosphere of the setting. It's an iconic and brilliant score, suitable for the greatest western film of all time.Overall, everything in this film just comes together perfectly. Everything. Sure, it's 3 hour run time isn't everybody's cup of tea but you should at least treat yourself to this epic at least once before you die. It's characters, cinematography, music, etc is all perfect. It is a perfect film. It has stood the test of time and will continue to do so for many more decades. A cinematic masterpiece. The western to rule all westerns.

Usually I do not watch Western movies, but I think I will watch more. I have seen one other movie with Clint Eastwood and in it, called the Unforgiven. I love the Unforgiven, but I felt that this movie had everything. It is really interesting to find out how the good, the bad, and the ugly are related to each other in this movie. The story is very complex and the acting is terrific. The soundtrack, by Ennio Morricone, is excellent as well; I have heard the theme music before and I never knew that it came from this movie. I also recognized the Ecstasy of Gold, which plays as an introduction for Metallica concerts. In the film, it was really interesting to learn why the good, the bad, and the ugly needed each other alive in order for them to complete the same quest: to obtain the money from the grave in the cemetery. This film has so many great quotes, such as \"When you have to shoot, shoot. Don't talk.\" I laughed so hard at that part! It was interesting when Tuco wants justice for what Blondie did in the beginning, but later on, the two of them develop a friendship. Trust also plays a role in this film. When Tuco and Blondie put TNT on the bridge, they share secrets about which grave the money is in; however, when Tuco discovers no money in the grave, Blondie reveals that he never trusted Tuco. This is why I feel like character development plays a major role in this film; however, I feel that this film is mostly plot-driven.

Plot is slight, the three principals are on a collision course to find some buried gold, with each man having varying degrees of scuzziness, so how will it pan out?Such is the genius of the narrative, it's a fascinating journey to undertake. The characterisations are ripe and considered, the various traits and peccadilloes beautifully enhanced, and with Leone being Leone, there's no shortage of cruelty and humour.

I've been well aware of its revered reputation amongst moviegoers, but I had no idea just how mesmerising it is to watch, no matter who you are or what you know about cinema, nor how quickly it would pop into my list of perfect movies.Set in the unforgiving environments of New Mexico, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly tracks the three eponymous bounty hunters racing to find Confederate gold. The narrative is original, unpredictable, and meticulously constructed throughout the three- hour runtime. The context of the American Civil War is used as a setting rather than a subject so we can focus on the story. The script, bereft of dialogue in most places, slowly builds up to one of the best endings in all of cinema. Picture a desolate cemetery with the three leads in a tense Mexican standoff, contrasted by Ennio Morricone's blazing score, and polished by a memorable quote - \"You see, in this world, there's two kinds of people, my friend: Those with loaded guns and those who dig. You dig.\"Despite the language barriers between the American actors and the Italian crew, coupled with Leone's alleged perfectionism, he executes his vision to perfection, utilising a wide variety of camera angles and real locations to further captivate the audience. However, Clint Eastwood (The Good), Lee Van Clef (The Bad) and Eli Wallach (The Ugly) combine Leone's direction with their own aptitude in acting to elevate the material. Leone veteran Ennio Morricone establishes himself as a god in film scoring, combining conventional instruments with whistling, gunfire and the iconic two-note whistled motif that forever changed film music.If there's one thing I'll remember The Good, The Bad and The Ugly for, its the enormous similarity it bears to the work of one of my biggest filmmaking idols: the self-professed, highly knowledgeable and irrepressible Quentin Tarantino. It's easy to see how the smooth dialogue, punctiliously crafted tension, genius orchestration of music, varied cinematography and the overall epic and grandiose experience of this movie are replicated effectively in films like Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill and Inglorious Basterds. I should also mention how The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, like Tarantino's films, instigates almost every type of response from the audience, including laughter, anger, anxiety, confusion, etc. Tarantino sure wasn't joking around when he declared The Good, The Bad and The Ugly as \"the greatest achievement in the history of cinema\".", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 5}, "heading": "Punctiliously crafted", "date": "2015-12-12T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3370671", "sentiment score": [0.1574, 0.5274, 0.1673, 0.0996, 0.0483]}, {"content": "There is a reason that this movie has inspired so many parodies over the years. There is a reason it is the first thing that comes to people's minds when they think of Westerns. There a reason that its theme is instantly recognizable.It is the best Western movie ever made, plain and simple.Every angle is perfect. Every line contributes something. Every event both captures your imagination and sets up what is to come. It does not involve me as much as Skyfall does, but it is just so inhumanly great without sacrificing its very human grit and style. Even people who are not film critics or analysts of any kind or even frequenters of high art can look at this movie and say, \"That's a really good film.\" Of course, this movie is not watched by as many people as it should be. I'm willing to bet that for every twenty people who have heard of this film, maybe one or two have actually seen it. Again, I get it. If you're not a major film buff or film buff wannabe or die-hard lover of Westerns, it is hard to convince yourself to take a full three hours out of your busy schedule to watch a slower paced film that was made fifty years ago. But if you ever have a chance, check it out.There is everything to be said about this movie. About how it subverted many traditional western tropes while laying the groundwork for far more. About how it catapulted Clint Eastwood into stardom, stardom that he has fostered and still basks in fifty years later. About how it took what worked in the first two Sergio Leone Westerns and made some additions of its own. And so much else that I could likely think of if only I rewatched it. From what I remember, it is so dense despite being so sprawling.There is also nothing to be said about this movie. It is like the American West itself (ignore for a moment the fact that this film was shot in Spain by a team of Italians). I've been fortunate enough to explore the West myself, and let me tell you, no words can capture the open freedom that you feel out there. This movie is something similar. Just like any journey, everyone will have a separate experience. But like any journey to a beautiful place, it will be worth it.There is something about the movie that makes you wish, at least for a second, that you could be in that world. Not the Old West, though that would be interesting. No, I'm talking about this film's version of the Old West. There is pain and danger and adventure and action and risk; but also those long pauses that allows everything to sink in. Combine that with the fact that they are going off of a real place, and you can both see yourself there and legitimately want to go.The main, is, of course, played by Clint Eastwood. He is subdued but fierce and sly. Whether or not you consider the 'Dollars Films' a trilogy- I don't- there is no doubt that his character here could easily be the same man from the other movies. This doesn't mean he hasn't changed; he is more visibly weary here, something that both helps this film stand out from and tie together to the other two films.But of course, he is only 'The Good.' The other two, Lee Van Cleef's 'Angel Eyes' and Eli Wallach's Tuco... Ramirez, make up 'The Bad' and 'The Ugly,' respectively. The three of them are searching for some hidden Confederate gold, and yes, it is an epic quest that takes them across the West. This is one of those movies where it's less about what sets the story in motion and more what it does when it's there. So much happens. It builds up and up, so high up that if the climax isn't spectacular, you would be disappointed and let down.But of course, that's fantastic as well. I'm not going to spoil what happens (though I don't think I'd be hurting anyone if I did; this film came out over fifty years ago) but I will say that you are in for a treat. On the surface, it's simple, if cleaver and well-written and smart. But the way they shoot it and direct it and score it and act it gives it so much depth and atmosphere. Ennio Morricone has composed many, many great pieces in this film alone, a few of which even people who have never seen this movie would recognize, so often are they repeated and parodied. But for my fist full of dollars (couldn't resist), none tops the piece that plays hear, simply called 'The Trio.' This scene is famous for what people who went to film school might call 'super tight shots.' The camera zooms in right on the character's eyes. This, like any artistic technique, can be used masterfully or horribly, depending on the production (check out the Dutch angles on Battlefield Earth; I shudder every time I see clips of it.) For this film, of course, it is the former.

The first 'Angel Eyes' is a gun for hire who learns the name of the man who stole the money from one of his victims. The other two are Tuco and 'Blondie' have been working a scam where Blondie turns in Tuco for the reward money then rescues him to do it again in another town\u0085 till they have a falling out. Shortly afterwards they come across a Confederate coach that just happens to contain the man Angel Eyes was looking for; he tells Tuco about the gold and the name of the cemetery where it is buried then, while Tuco is getting him water he tells Blondie the name on the grave\u0085 if either of them are to get their hands on the money they will have to work together. Things don't go according to plan and they have a run in with Angel Eyes; he gets the name of the cemetery from Tuco then offers Blondie the same 50/50 deal he had with Tuco. Ultimately the three of them will be reunited in the cemetery but which of them will get the gold.This is probably the best known of the spaghetti Westerns\u0085 and deservedly so. It starts with a quiet menace as we are introduced to Angel Eyes (The Bad) then shows a touch of cynical humour as we are introduced to Tuco (The Ugly) and Blondie (The Good). The plot is fairly simple but the journey for our protagonists will be anything but as the travel through the war torn American South West towards a grave in a remote cemetery. Their journey will be full of betrayals as each tries to get the information that will cut the others out of the deal. People who are used to classic American made westerns may be a little surprised that there are no heroes here; all three protagonists are venal, cynical and would happily kill the others for the cash\u0085 this of course is what makes the film so refreshing! It is also quite violent for a film of its time with numerous shootings and plenty of blood.Director Sergio Leone captures the action perfectly and the cast do a fine job. Clint Eastwood brings a dry humour to the role of Blondie, Lee van Cleef is delightfully unpleasant as Angel Eyes and Eli Wallach is great as Tuco. The story has plenty of action, some amusing moments and even a few touching scenes such as when Tuco meets his brother. The Spanish scenery looks spectacular\u0085 and more like the 'Wild West' than many westerns churned out in California. It is impossible to comment on this film without mentioning Ennio Morricone's score; it is brilliant throughout but there are some scenes that will have the viewer reaching for the remote to crank up the volume; not only does it sound great it also fits with the action.

The direction was awesome! All actors perform exquisitely. Specially Eli Wallach. In these opening frames, Sergio Leone established a rule that he follows throughout \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.\" The rule is that the ability to see is limited by the sides of the frame. At important moments in the film, what the camera cannot see, the characters cannot see, and that gives Leone the freedom to surprise us with entrances that cannot be explained by the practical geography of his shots.There is a moment, for example, when men do not notice a vast encampment of the Union Army until they stumble upon it. And a moment in a cemetery when a man materializes out of thin air even though he should have been visible for a mile. And the way men walk down a street in full view and nobody is able to shoot them, maybe because they are not in the same frame with them.Leone cares not at all about the practical or the plausible, and builds his great film on the rubbish of Western movie clich\u00e9s, using style to elevate dreck into art. When the movie opened in America in late 1967, not long after its predecessors \"A Fistful of Dollars\" (1964) and \"For a Few Dollars More\" (1965), audiences knew they liked it, but did they know why?I saw it sitting in the front row of the balcony of the Oriental Theatre, whose vast wide screen was ideal for Leone's operatic compositions. I responded strongly, but had been a movie critic less than a year, and did not always have the wisdom to value instinct over prudence.

It's quite the odyssey that Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach, and Lee Van Cleef in those title roles have in search of the loot. A minor theater of the Civil War is operating in the west and all of them get caught up in it as well.Clint Eastwood developed and honed his laconic and cynical character who was in fact a good guy.

Note that Clint Eastwood also never returned to the spaghetti western after this film.Van Cleef is his usual mean self, perhaps exponentially so. One thing about him is that he's a hired killer with a strong work ethic so I guess that counts for something. When he takes a contract he follows through. As for Wallach he dusts off his Mexican bandit characterization that served him so well in The Magnificent Seven is dusted off and embellished.

Even if you're not a fan of westerns, you'll at least have a vague idea as to what it's about. However for those of you who are unsure, it's about greed, war and er, two kinds of people.In 1966, Sergio Leone followed up the unparalleled awesomeness of A Fistful of Dollars and For A Few Dollars More with this gritty tale of the battle-of-wits between three outlaws whose fight for survival is driven not by instinct, but by greed. A somewhat politicised story of greed, there is more to the premise of TGTBTU than brazen immorality. In the powder keg decade that was the 1960s, the anti-war film was becoming increasingly popular thanks to images of U.S troops in Vietnam being projected into households worldwide. Many fans of TGTBTU will even ignore it's anti-war subtext, sadly dismissing the movie as nothing more than a cool cowboy flick. Our three main characters are \"temporarily\" sobered by the effects of war, but choose to remain ignorant to it's horrors. Leone isn't only interested in the physical effects of combat, he doesn't hold back from showing it's crippling emotional strain. Take the character of the unnamed Union Captain, who has begun a slow descent into madness and severe alcoholism due to ridiculous military logic. I also found the sight of the thousands of soldiers charging into battle in the film's second half rather haunting, these men aren't going to fight, they're going to be slaughtered. We are transported to a post-apocalyptic world by visuals of towns ravaged by cannon fire and bodies littering a barren landscape. Tongue-in-cheek cynicism is the order of the day and the hanging scenes allocate pinches of dark comedy, after all the movie is a satire. There are great performances all round but the three leads are just excellent. Clint Eastwood's Blondie is great but it is Eli Wallach's Tuco who steals the show. His foul mouthed tantrums are nothing short of humorous and the odds are stacked so ironically against him throughout the film. He also carries one of the coolest pistols ever to feature in a western and the gun store scene is just sublime. The last five minutes of the movie in which he is nearly hanged will always raise a hearty chuckle too. The legend that is Lee Van Cleef played the sadistic Angel Eyes brilliantly, a far cry from the valiant Colonel Mortimer of FAFDM. Although, Van Cleef gets considerably less screen time than Eastwood and Wallach and he is really the most villainous of the three.Of course no Sergio Leone film would be complete without the presence of a poetic Morricone score. You would need to have been living underground all your life not to have heard the iconic title score at least once. Thrillingly roaring over the gorgeous title sequence along with thunderous bursts of rifle and mortar fire, the score denotes the epic that is TGTBTU. \"Story of a Soldier\" is chillingly sincere, evoking the film's anti-war theme and \"The Trio\" commences the climatic showdown, giving the sequence a pinch of Gothic. \"Ecstasy of Gold\" is a truly majestic composition and will forever be one of my favourites. As with the previous two movies, the masterful editing techniques generate the tension brilliantly. Here it isn't the action itself that matters, rather the heavy build-ups of disquieting tension prior to the sharp explosions of gunfire. The film climaxes with the amazingly operatic triello(three way showdown)in which Leone relishes those continuous tight close-ups. Spectacularly taut, I still have to force myself to watch even on a fourth viewing. Heralding a new style of suspense, Leone creates a superbly baroque feel and the movie's violence as a whole is so aestheticized that it becomes lyrical. He spent AFOD and FAFDM practising the craft of tension and by this movie he had become a master of that craft, although the triello is such a phenomenon in itself that the entire sequence could be a short film on it's own. TGTBTU features impressive stunt-work and special effects(the controversial destruction of the bridge was fantastic!)and the aforementioned battle scene and subsequent bombardment were both extremely tense. The movie is set during the New Mexico campaign of 1862 and maintains authenticity by making reference to prominent historical figures such as Abraham Lincoln, General Sibley, Lee, Grant and Colonel Edward Canby. It is also a prequel to AFOD and FAFDM as they are set several years after the civil war.Nobody will disagree that Sergio Leone revolutionised the western genre and this movie itself will forever be a pioneering force.

It is suspenseful watching Eastwood and Tuco race against Angel Eyes to find the gold, all in the mist of the war. For a three-hour movie, the pacing is a little slow at times, making you crave for more action. But, the drama, tension, and excellent acting (the unpredictable, suave yet good-hearted Blondie, the capricious and money-hungry Tuco and the cold-blooded and sinister Angel Eyes) keeps the movie captivating nonetheless.Ennio Morricone gave us another catchy music score, perfect for a western movie and delivering one of cinema's most recognizable and iconic music themes.

Sorry about that, Eli. Eastwood again plays the Man with No Name whom we have already seen in A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More. Our hero, this time referred to as Blondie, may be \"good\" compared to the other two leading characters but having seen the first two films we know he is not the traditional all-American hero. He's not all good, he's more complex than that. There's not much complexity to Angel Eyes, the character played by Van Cleef. This guy is bad to the bone. Meanwhile Wallach threatens to steal the show. He plays Tuco and this is a guy who, in an otherwise very quiet movie, never shuts up. Good, bad and ugly are searching for $200,000 in Confederate gold known to be buried in a cemetery. It's a very simple plot for a very long movie but the time flies by. Director Sergio Leone ratchets up the tension and keeps you on the edge of your seat.The events of this film, unfolding during the Civil War, actually take place prior to the events of the first two films in the Dollars Trilogy. And the war certainly intrudes on the story, causing complications for our characters in their desperate search for that gold. A big war battle scene lends a bit of grandeur that the first two films didn't have. Leone is making a film of much larger scale this time around. But while the war looms over everything this is still a story about our hero and the two companions he would very much like to be rid of. There are great twists and turns as at different times in the movie different members of the trio have the upper hand. Sometimes you're at the top, sometimes you're at the bottom, sometimes you're forced into an unholy alliance with your great adversary. All along the way there is much drama. And along with the drama there is plenty of action too. This is a movie which grabs your attention right at the start and holds it throughout.Blondie is the nominal hero, making Eastwood the nominal star. And, as already established in the prior two films, Eastwood suits the role perfectly. He's the perfect embodiment of the quiet, cunning, not totally heroic hero. Van Cleef played a good guy, more or less, in For a Few Dollars More. This time around he gets to play a total baddie and he sinks his teeth into the role with great relish. Wallach is a little over-the-top but delightfully so. Tuco is a crazed, maniacal character and Wallach pours his heart into his performance. He brings so much energy to the film. Three great actors, three great characters. Leone could hardly go wrong. And the film has so much more to offer. With breathtaking visuals and a truly memorable score the film both looks and sounds spectacular. Story, actors, cinematography, music. This film is the total package. It is certainly the best of the Dollars Trilogy, this is the Man with No Name's greatest adventure. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is often found on short lists of the greatest films ever made. That kind of acclaim may be overselling things just a touch.

Bandit Tuco (Eli Wallach) is 'The Ugly', which I think is a little unfair to the bloke: he's no George Clooney, but he's not Quasimodo either. That leaves cold-hearted killer Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) as 'The Bad', which he most definitely is, even going so far as to kill a child in order to achieve his goals. After Blondie and Tuco chance upon a dying Confederate soldier who reveals to them the whereabouts of a fortune in gold, the pair come to the attention of Angel Eyes, who will do anything to lay his hands on the treasure.The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, the third film in Sergio Leone's Dollars trilogy, is an epic spaghetti western that benefits from iconic central characters, an undeniable sense of cool, and, of course, that classic Ennio Morricone soundtrack (Waaawawah, waa waa waa!). Where the film doesn't fare quite so well is in the pacing and storytelling, the basic plot\u2014three guys go in search of hidden treasure\u2014stretched painfully thin, particularly in the Extended Cut, which clocks in at approximately three hours. The expansive historical backdrop\u2014the American Civil War\u2014frequently detracts from the flow of the story and Leone has a tendency to labour a little too much over his style, lingering on his characters for an eternity and repeating similar shots ad nasueum, all of which causes scenes to drag. Fortunately, some nice touches of humour and a couple of neat plot twists help to make matters a little easier to digest.6/10.

Frist there is Blondie (Clint Eastwood) the There is Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleff) and Finally Pablo (Eli Wallach). In an abstract way this is a classic story of good versus evil, but as all three are outlaws and bandits at times it is hard to tell who is good, bad or ugly.

Until the final show down and yes you guessed it Blondie wins and kill Angel Eyes and holds Pablo at gun point and makes him dig the gold up for him. Then he rides off into the sunset as it were. It seems that this is a western explanation of yin and yang as in this movie nothing is 100% bad or 100% good. It seems that most of Eastwood's movies follow this path. I found strong story ties between this movie and \"A fist Full of Dollars\". A scene that stands out as a picture of good versus evil and the yin and yang theme is at one point Blondie and Pablo wonder on to a battle field and talk to a union captain and then watch a battle where the killing is no stop. During a lull in the fight these two, who could have went around the battle sneak onto it and blow a bridge so that the two sides cannot get to each other to fight.The wide angle camera angles and photography by Tonino Delli Colli that show the landscaped some the best I have ever seen.

In some cases, the project was illegal, and given the Production Code in force at the time, the criminals had to die or be arrested, as in \"The Killing\" (1956). In \"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\" (1963), the treasure hunters are not criminals, but the buried treasure was stolen loot, so they all had to be arrested in the end. But even when the enterprise was entirely legal, there was an unwritten rule that it must fail, that pursuing money per se was wrong in some way and must not be rewarded. For example, in \"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" (1948), there was nothing illegal about the three men prospecting for gold, but it had to fail nevertheless. When the two surviving members of the team realize that all their gold has been lost, they laugh about it. Presumably, even when the search for money was legal, it had to fail, as a way of making those in the audience content with their lot. One slight exception is \"King Solomon's Mines\" (1950 et al.). They do manage to keep a handful of gems, but the vast treasure is lost for good.And then came \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.\" Three men set out to find buried treasure, and something incredible happens: the treasure does not turn out to be worthless Confederate bonds; it does not blow away in the wind; the men pursuing the treasure are not arrested; and only one of them dies, leaving the other two alive to split the loot. Nothing like that had ever been seen in a movie before, and the violation of the taboo against that sort of thing was exhilarating.This amoral ending was perfectly in line, however, with all that had come before in that movie. Were it not for the advance notice provided by the tagline, \"For three men the Civil War wasn't Hell. It was practice,\" we would not even realize that the movie was set in the Civil War when it begins. And it is only gradually that we become aware of the war, because it really does not seem to concern the three principle characters. The Ugly is a bandit, the Good is a bounty hunter, and the Bad is a hired killer, each pursuing his own business with no interest in the war. Only when they find out about the buried Confederate gold does the war take on significance for them. And as they pursue that gold, the war slowly closes in around them, either getting in their way or providing opportunities. They walk through that war as if they were walking through a cluttered room. In one case, when the war is really getting in their way, they blow up a bridge so that the soldiers will leave the area, which has as an incidental byproduct the result that the pointless daily slaughter is brought to an end.Actually, the amoral nature of this movie was no surprise, for it was also characteristic of the two previous Westerns by Sergio Leone featuring the Man with No Name, \"A Fistful of Dollars\" (1964) and \"For a Few Dollars More\" (1965). This was a new kind of Western protagonist. He was not a law enforcement officer; he was not seeking to avenge someone's death; and he was not trying to reform and hang up his guns. Instead, he was either a hired gun or bounty hunter who profited by his expertise with a pistol, and had no intention of changing his ways.In many ways, the movie is a comedy, for it is replete with cruel jokes and humorous dialogue, of which these are some of my favorite punch lines:\"Once I'm paid, I always see the job through.\"\"But you don't look like the one who'll collect it.\"\"I'd hate to be placed in his shoes.\"\"More feeling!\"\"There's no name on this stone either.\"If you don't recall some of these lines, that is a good reason to watch this movie one more time, as if you needed a reason.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 5}, "heading": "An Amoral Treasure Hunt", "date": "2015-01-21T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3167318", "sentiment score": [0.0798, 0.2249, 0.2694, 0.3504, 0.0756]}, {"content": "This movie cemented my love for movies the first time I saw it when I was young.

It changed the way we look at westerns. It's been endlessly imitated and parodied, but never equaled. It made Clint Eastwood a household name. And yet, as I watch The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, I can't help but feel a little sad knowing that what is perhaps the greatest of all westerns was made in Italy. Yes, this is one of the much-maligned spaghetti westerns, but it's as far above the average entry in its genre as Star Wars is to Starship Troopers, or A Hard Day's Night to Spiceworld.Surely we're all familiar with the basics of the story. The mysterious gunman Blondie (Eastwood), the rough hewn bandit Tuco (Eli Wallach), and the heartless killer Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) search the west for a hidden cache of gold, as the Civil War rages around them. There are countless twists, turns and betrayals, as each man realizes he can't do this on his own. You can't be sure of anything, except that before the adventure is over, there's going to be one hell of a showdown.Sergio Leone has done an exceptional job of writing and directing. There's not one line of unnecessary dialog, in fact there's no dialog at all for many long stretches. And not since High Noon has a movie been as successful at slowly building tension. Of course in High Noon, the entire movie was buildup, until the final shootout. Here, Leone gradually builds tension in a scene, and then provides a stylistically violent payoff again and again.Nowhere does he do it better than in the final standoff, where each of the three leading characters have a gun trained on one of the others. They each know that whoever wins here will walk away one of the richest men in the west, but they're also aware that pulling the trigger has a very good chance of getting both them and their target killed. And yet, if two of them where to ally themselves against the third\u0085. We in the audience are also fully aware of these facts, but the movie gives us no clue as to who will come out the loser. Leone has also produced something that is a true feast for the senses. Through use of long unbroken shots, he shows the vastness, solitude, and desolate beauty of the west. Mesas, canyon lands, endless sand dunes, and scrub forest are all lavishly photographed, as the wind whistles and dust flies on the breeze. His sunrises and sunsets are works of art. Looking at this movie, it's easy to forget that it was filmed in Europe. Leone has also added quirky touches, like the legless veteran who hangs out at the local saloon, quite literally dragging himself up to the counter, or the Union colonel obsessed with destroying the bridge he's supposed to guard, so there won't be anything fighting over and he can go home. Of course it's not just the director who's responsible a movie's success or failure. The actors matter as well, and much credit is due the leading men for their brilliant performances. Clint Eastwood has long been one of my favorite actors, and this is by far one of his best pieces of acting. As Blondie, he's as tough as nails, utterly cool under fire, and one of the most mysterious figures since Jeff Costello. There's little of his past; he's in a rather unique partnership with Tuco at the film's beginning, and there's a history with Angel Eyes, but we get no idea where he's from, or what life he led before becoming an outlaw. He doesn't talk much either, preferring to puff on his cigarette. But he clearly follows some form of personal code, and there's no doubt that he's one of- if not the- best gunmen in the west.Cleef's Angel Eyes is much more straightforward; he's the very embodiment of evil. This man has no qualms about killing. Indeed, he seems to relish causing death and suffering for its own sake, as when he smothers an elderly employer to death with a pillow, or carries out his iron-fisted rule of a Union prison camp. His every word drips with menace, and his smile is like gazing up death itself.But the most interesting character just might be Eli Wallach's Tuco. He's got a rap sheet a mile long, and he goes to great lengths to carry out his revenge on Blondie, but he doesn't have the same aura of menace as Angel Eyes. He lies, cheats, steals, and sometimes kills, but not so much because he's evil as because he has no concept of morality. He's also funniest guy on the screen. In one scene he's all sweet talk, your best pal; not that he's believable for a second. The next minute he's launching a hilarious obscenity-laced rant against you and your family. Tuco's reunion with his brother- a priest! - is one of the best comedy scenes in any western. There are other comedic touches as well, like the legless veteran who hangs around the saloons, walking on his arms, or the Union commander bent on destroying the bridge he's tasked with protecting so that the fighting will end.It's also refreshing how few clich\u00e9s there are. There's no extraneous love interest, no Indian attacks or stampedes, and you never hear anyone shouting about \"gathering up a posse.\" There is talking killer, but he's only a bit player, and Tuco lectures him on why you shouldn't talk when you can shoot- after shooting him, of courseBetween the acting, the action, the characters, the production values, and the originality, The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is an achievement to rival the best of John Ford. Any fan of westerns, and anyone who enjoys good film should watch this one. It is truly one of the great movies.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 4, "votes": 9}, "heading": "The Best Western Ever Made", "date": "2014-12-07T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3137343", "sentiment score": [0.015, 0.0715, 0.1854, 0.5111, 0.217]}, {"content": "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is the greatest spaghetti western ever made, and may just possibly be the greatest western ever made. It is a perfect film, and would easily win a fight against the Godfather. If you look up \"perfect\" in the dictionary, you first see Meryl Streep's Oscar Nomination Record, then The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. But what could possibly be so good about this western?The film begins with the most jarring cinematography I have ever seen to start a film. After the intro theme, this man, Elam, pops his head into the screen. This not only sets up the rest of the film's cinematography, with the camera either super close or super far away, but also gives us a face to remember, as in an hour and a half or so we will meet this character again. In this scene we meet The Ugly. Later The Bad. Then The Good. This contrasts from the title, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, as we show the characters in the opposite order from which we may expect. The Ugly runs off after attacking Elam and two other outlaws. The we turn to an arid section of the desert where we meet Angel Eyes. We know that he's up to no good as everyone nearby quickly hides. Except for this guy, who keeps eating his soup. This probably because he knows its his last meal. We learn that Angel Eyes is looking for a man by the name of Bill Carson. He is searching for Carson because there is a lot of money behind his name, and because he was hired to help Baker, the man who hired Angel Eyes to take out this Soup Man. However, by the end of the meal, we have not only set up an objective, but also some character development. Soup Man knows that he is going to die, but pays Angel Eyes to kill the man who paid to kill him. Angel Eyes accepts the job, and the cash, but still kills Soup Man as, \"Once I'm paid, I always see the job through.\"He goes through with his new job kills Baker, the man who hired him originally. This shows that although Angel Eyes is The Bad he has honor. If The Ugly were to be in Angel Eyes' situation he would have taken the money from Soup Man and not have gone through with the job. So now we have to think. Who is the better man, a scoundrel or the Bad?Finally we meet The Good. We find out that he is working with The Ugly and that the two are con men. What they do is this: The Good turns in The Ugly for a reward. He takes the money and then frees The Ugly. Then they split the cost and repeat. Now we must once again start to question morals here. The Good is not literally \"good,\" as he does bad things. However, deep down he has a heart of good and in the end will usually choose the wiser, more moral route than the other characters we meet. One thing I love about this film is how even though there are three separate characters doing three separate things--The Good and The Ugly eventually split off--they all coordinate with each other in the end. One thing that happens in the beginning of the film at one location may come back to haunt certain characters later in the film at a completely different location. Let's take Elam for instance. In the very beginning of the film he and his two partners are shot by The Ugly. Then two whole hours later Elam find The Ugly and tries to kill him. This doesn't work out too well as The Ugly apparently bathes with his gun. Other moments like this occur throughout the film which adds realism to the story.The most critical point of joining these three together by chance is when the plot is revealed to our trio. We already know that The Bad is after a certain amount of gold, but The Good and The Ugly don't know about this gold or Bill Carson until an hour into the film and the only reason this happens if because of great character development. See after The Good has left The Ugly in the desert to die, The Ugly finds The Good and gives him the same punishment. Whilst doing so we begin the absolutely hate The Ugly as he torments The Good. While in the desert they find Bill Carson, the man who The Bad is looking for. The Ugly is told the location of where the treasure is hidden, a cemetery. The Good is told the name of the grave. Now the tables have turned as The Ugly must keep The Good alive in order to find the treasure. Shortly after The Bad, who by the way is a army captain, finds the two and The Ugly poses as Bill Carson. Soon The bad tortures The Ugly and we once again question our thinking. We saw The Ugly earlier being just awful to The Good but now we are sympathizing toward him because of the bad. From here I will reveal no more of the plot, as this is a movie you need to see and I do not want to have it spoiled for you. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a masterpiece. Not only is it a brilliant Western but also a film. It has an outstanding plot, cinematography, acting, music, and directing.

Now, the acting is good, the casting is perfect, the idea is great. So what went wrong?For one, it feels dull. It has a slow pace and often times it becomes irritating. Moreover, some of the scenes have little, if any relevance for the plot. This has an alienating effect on the audience.Another problematic thing is the humour. The film tries to insert humour quite often, but these attempts by and large fail and scenes come across as silly rather than funny. Too often one is left feeling disappointed that the punch line failed to materialize.The action scenes are quite dull as well. The huge numbers of extras in uniforms and all the guns and explosions fail to create any real sense of war. They remain as a rather pale mat painting in the background. As for the revolver duels, they too are surprisingly dull. Granted, the final showdown is quite memorable, but the others are unfortunately rather unimpressive.There is also a lack of logic, which is quite frustrating. There is little in the film that makes sense, the decisions made by characters are often absurd, and the audience is left wondering what actually happened and why.Regarding protagonists, 'the ugly' steals the show, while Eastwood is not given enough things to do. His character remains undeveloped, although Leone makes some attempts to give him depth. Also, the antagonist is not menacing enough. He is given too little screen time and never manages to be a genuine threat.Unnecessary gratuitousness. This is something Spaghetti Western is known for, and something I tend to dislike. There is a scene where Tuco is beaten about in order to extract information from him, and this goes on forever for no reason. Throughout the film there are moments where we are forced to endure protracted, often violent scenes that may seem grand and intense, but carry no emotional punch and have little relevance in terms of advancing the plot. Leone does this time and again, and it is clear that he experiences these scenes in a way that is peculiar to him, but which remains a mystery to many viewers. Too often I feel that he is aiming for an emotion I simply do not experience while watching the film.I will not go on about what else is wrong. I will conclude with some more positive things. As I said, the music is superb and does wonders for the film. Also, I like the general tone. His depiction of the warring parties may be inaccurate, but Leone does manage to create a sense of dread and disgust. The scene in the graveyard, accompanied by Morricone's score is excellent. The counterpoint between the greedy misfits in search of buried gold and the solemnity and horror of the huge graveyard littered with graves of men who died for their ideals is quite effective.The story is definitely a good one, shame the actual script is too weak and Leone's sensibility and sense of humour are, at least in my view, somewhat peculiar.", "rating": 5, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 12, "votes": 32}, "heading": "Wasted opportunity", "date": "2014-10-17T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3106222", "sentiment score": [0.076, 0.7068, 0.2098, 0.007, 0.0004]}, {"content": "My all-time favorite movie!

Mind you, this has a running time of nearly 3 hours (177 minutes to be precise). Thus, the greatness can be attributed to the fact that this film keeps a viewer engaged for such a long time. I watched this film a couple of time before and was always awed by the technical aspects of this film. When I finished watching it just now, I was thinking how a small story can be made into a grand script and then into a magnum opus too. It takes the vision of a director and his team. Sergio Leone definitely had that.The music is iconic from Ennio Morricone and the theme music is great and the soundtrack is just terrific. The cinematography which was done as a cinema scope film in the desert and wastelands of New Mexico state is just amazing. Technically this film is flawless I must say and there is a touch of greatness too. Yes, this is taking forward the good work done in an earlier film \"For A Few Dollars More\". But the grandeur is something that's enticing. The characterization is slick and straight, it's not complicated but very simple. Good plays good and Bad plays bad while Ugly struggles to be something in between. Ugly is perhaps the most interesting character in the three who does a wonderful job. Eli Wallach as Ugly is just impeccable.Clint Eastwood, who plays the Hero is a master of style and he shows it here. With minimal dialog and mostly through the looks of his eyes, he conveys a lot. From the way he lights his Cigar to the way he triggers his gun, his style is unmatchable and indeed inspiring. I suppose, his style is replicated by many actors later.Sergio Leone, has given one of the best cowboy films indeed. Also, he has given one of the finest films in terms of characterization, style, cinematography and music. I loved it and this film will be there and watched over by many generations.

Emotions of greed, confrontation, tolerance, compassion and vigilance are presented. Based on civil war, landscapes shown are as diverse as barren land, public area, detention center and church. The movie revolves around 3 gunmen traversing the war ravaged country for easy money. One of them, Tuco (the ugly), is a bandit who is wanted for many crimes and has reward offered for his head. But considering himself courageous, he usually gets himself handed over to police by Blondie (the good) with the agreement that Blondie later helps him escape the custody and share the reward. Angel Eyes (the bad) is introduced as a contract killer. During one such contract, he gets to know about a treasure. In its quest, he tries to search for a man named Jackson who knows the treasure location. But luckily, Tuco and Blondie are first to know of the location from Jackson just before he dies. Now what follows is a struggle to reach the location first. The movie cleverly shows how they navigate the country amid the war. The characters are nicely portrayed with Blondie being compassionate and composed, besides being a sharp shooter, alert and lucky. He has a humane side, even though he is initially shown to be the friend of a bandit. His actions and reasoning align with his benevolent nature many times in the movie. Tuco is also sharp shooter and alert, but he isn't a tactical person. He doesn't carry similar compassionate nature and is shown to be carried away by greed. Angel Eyes has a relatively small role but he still leaves his mark on the viewers. He is depicted as a tactical and vigilant man and the name \"Angel Eyes\" suits the character.

IMO, it's not only the best 'Western' ever made, but one of the best films of all time. Not for the picture quality... as it can be a little rough and grainy. Not for the dialog over-dubbing, which is often out of sync due to the range of languages spoken when it was shot. And not for the historical inaccuracies or feasibility of the physical burdens endured by the characters (it's way more realistic than James Bond anyway). Those are what give the film its charm and retro appeal! Personally, I think this film is great because of the overall 'mood' it creates, both visually and audibly. It has, by far, one of the most unusual and recognizable music scores in movie history, blending the traditionally-used orchestral brass section with human whistles, cackles, grunts, and an electric guitar, to create a tapestry of sound that strangely fits perfectly (even though the time period depicted predates the electric guitar by more than half a century). Then, in the spaces, the wind-blown desolation in the sound track really gives you the sense of being there with the characters in that barren desert. It's the dynamic range in both the soundtrack and the pacing of the story that sets such a great undercurrent for the talented trio to do their magic. All three seasoned actors with impressive credits both before and after this film seemed to cross paths at just the right time in their careers to face off in their most memorable performances to date. And rather than a typical Western--one wronged man against a whole town; a masked hero and his trusty sidekick; or a rag-tag posse banding together only to get killed off one by one by bandits--this is three distinct personalities going head to head to head, each with a little good, a little bad, and a little ugly in them to varying degrees. On the script side, it's really more of a human interest story than an action film. And it poignantly bullet-points (no pun intended) that often the \"good guy\" really only needs to be the \"least bad\" of the bunch to obtain that moniker, which has all sorts of parallels in all walks of life.

What can be said about a film now widely regarded as one of the greatest films of all time? What about when it was first released?When Sergio Leone's \"The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly\" first premiered to US audiences in 1967 (1966 in Italy) it was a time when many critics looked down on the Spaghetti Western genre as a whole. The Western genre itself was starting to wear off its appeal for many critics and said audience viewed the Spaghetti Western as an excuse to depict senseless violence which is exactly what they criticized about Leone's film. Critics at TIME, Variety, The New York Times, and the L.A. Times are a few examples of the major US publications that gave negative reviews to Leone's film. I write all this neither to mock the critics' opinions nor their reviews of the film at the time because from a historian's perspective these reviews provide insight into the US' critical movie culture towards a genre deemed then as violent trash. Yet history has shown a different opinion since its release.Upon the film's release it became a hit (both national and international) and more importantly was influential beyond film becoming iconic in countless forms of art. The film breathed new life into the Western; the main theme topped 1968 charts for a year and now is one of the most recognized movie themes ever; \"A Fistful of Dollars\" introduced Eastwood's \"Man With No Name\" character but this film cemented him as an icon in the public mind. Many filmmakers, musicians, writers, painters, designers (clothing, video games, etc) point this film out as influential in their careers. Again I will not spoil anything and anyone curious about the film should definitely check it out.

I'm watching the 2004 extended version, with all the delete scenes in it. Directed by Sergio Leone, this movie is the third film in the Dollars Trilogy following 1964's A Fistful of Dollars and 1965's For a Few Dollars More, serving as a prequel to them. Thank Goodness, the movie wasn't call 'The Two Magnificent Tramps', its working title. In the United States, United Artists considered using the original Italian translation, River of Dollars, or The Man with No Name, but decided on The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. The title, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly suite the plot so well. The plot revolves around three gunslingers, 'the Good' AKA 'Brodie' AKA 'The Man with no name (Clint Eastwood), 'The Bad' AKA 'Angel Eyes' (Lee Van Cleef) and 'The Ugly\" Mexican bandit Tuco Ramirez (Eli Wallach). All three are competing to find a fortune in buried Confederate gold during the American Civil War. All the actors in this film are great. Clint Eastwood is great. I love that the producers finally explain where his character got his trademark poncho. Granted, the other two were morally worse than him, but Blondie's not exactly a nice guy, too. It's more like 'the good enough'. I love, how Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach work with each other. Lots of chemistry there, yet a lot of backstabbing triathlon with the trio. Tuco is the only one of the trio, the audience really gets to know all about. We meet his brother and find out where he came from and why he became a bandit. The other two are more of a mysteries. The names \"Blondie\" and \"Angel Eyes\" aren't exactly threatening, but workable. Blondie's hair is sandy brown. This is due to imperfect translation from the original Italian. Mad props to Eli Wallach for doing all the dangerous stunts as he almost got killed in real life like three times during the making of this movie. Eli Wallach pretty much steals the movie with his character. Originally, Leone wanted Charles Bronson to play Angel Eyes but he was already committed to another movie, and Leone choose Lee Van Cleef as the villain, playing opposite to the character, he plays in the 'For a Few Dollars More'. I glad, Lee Van Cleef was chosen for the film. He was best as the villain. Still, it does get kinda confusing, story wise seeing how the films are supposedly connect to each other. In the theatrical trailer, Angel Eyes is referred to as The Ugly and Tuco as The Bad. This is due to a translation error; the original Italian title translates literally to \"The Good, the Ugly, the Bad\". Still, the Good, the Bad and the Ugly had tons of memorable lines, funny scenes, and epic action, but the movie is really long. It takes forever to get to the buried treasure part of the movie, even if you watching a way cut down version. Angel Eyes besides the opening, doesn't show up, until half way to the film. Lots of desert scenes that they add in the 2004 version was cut out for a good reason. The movie takes a lot of side steps missions like blowing a strategic bridge, bounty hunters, and money-schemes that were entertaining, but kinda distracting as the gold plot takes a backseat, most of the first act and second. The movie has a great sweeping widescreen cinematography by Director of photography Tonino Delli Colli. The Cemetery showdown is intense. I love how the movie is shot with all the dramatic extreme close ups to give the audience, a sense of tensed. The movie got tense, due to falling out between Leone and Clint Eastwood, as Eastwood got tired of all the camera shooting in different angles, sweeping long shots, and extreme close ups. Both never work together again, after this. I can see why Eastwood might had got upset. There is a bit too much artsy in the film, but it's not too bad. Many of Leone's trademarks, hugely influential to modern filmmakers. Unlike A Fistful of Dollars nor For a Few Dollars More, this film had a bigger budget and its shows. Mad props to the people had to build the bridge in the blowing up scene, it had to be filmed and build twice due to the camera being destroy in the first shot. Another to the crew building a cemetery, just for the Sad Hill shootout scene. The money was well-used. I love the Civil War theme. The theme shows how brutal the backdrop, the Civil War was during that time and how absurd it was. The dubbing on my version was really good. Love the Curse Cut Beep. Ennio Morricone composed the soundtrack. The main theme is turned into one for each protagonist: The Good's has a whistle, The Bad's an ocarina, and The Ugly's screamed. It works so well. 'Story of a soldier' is beautiful. It's eerily in a way, since it play during the torture scene. I also love the score, Ecstasy of Gold. It's haunting at the beginning, it draws you in, slowly. Then it smacks you in the face like a ton of bricks and voila! Depending on what version, you're watching this movie. It can take from 161 min to 186 min. The 186 minute is dubbed. If you find the 2002 extended, it's in English, but cut to 179 min. Then you have an old copy, like the 1984's version, its 142, but its cut as hell. In my opinion, just get the 2004 DVD. Tons of special features on the behind the scene production, documentaries, and additional footages like too badly damaged film negative. All of them are worth the price of 2004 DVD.

Instantly our pulses quicken, heart races and we must try our hardest to suppress a squeal of joy. Following on from two film predecessors; A Fist full of Dollars and For a few Dollars more, in a inherently Sergio Leon way, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly opens up with a series of intercutting close ups of sun beaten faces looking out towards the horizon, and wide shot of the setting, which appears to be an old rundown little town. But just as you would expect from the spaghetti western master, we are given very little information from the start. We don't know who these men are at first or what their intentions are, but from the looks of them, they don't seem all that two friendly. But what the opening shots do reveal, in particular Leon predilection for wide and close up paring, is that Leon was avid art collector; the close ups where reminiscent of Goya, while the vast unyielding landscapes where an allusion to surrealist painting style Leon was a fan off. As the men make their way down into what appears to be a salon, we don't follow them in instead we hear a shoot out occurring, then all of a sudden the camera pans to focus on a window in which 'The Ugly' leaps out with wine in one hand and a half eaten pigs leg in the other, this is Tuco (Eli Wallach), and those two items some him up best, he is a bear drinking, untrustworthy swine. But on the other hand he does phenomenally inject a whole lot of humour and wild edge to the film. Next we find ourselves with a little boy riding a donkey; he looks to the distance where he sees a lone man riding a horse towards him, we then passes him with little regard. Little does that boy know that man will go on to mercilessly shoot and kill both his brother and father, for that man is 'The Bad' also known as Angel eyes (Lee Van Cleef from John Ford's High-noon). Then last but not least, we return again to The Ugly we find himself in a tricky situation, involving three gun slingers. But cue the introduction of the man with no name (Technically he does have a name, its Blondie in the film and Clint Eastwood in real life) who saves Tuco only to return him to a nearby town to cash in on his bounty, justifying his title 'The Good' . But not everything is what it seems, it soon turns out the both men are in collusion and turning Tuco in is merely a trick to get the bounty, save Tuco from getting hanged and then gets the heck out of there. The plan is so genius that they could continue getting away with the same trick, oh wait they completely hate each other and can trust each other as far as they can throw. The relationship between the leads make for a great stand up duo; Tuco the loud mouth and Blondie the silent brooding one, similar to famous magicians Pen and Teller. Eventually for the rest of the film The Good, The Bad and The Ugly must unite in search for $200,000 loot stashed inside a person's grave, but only The Ugly knows where the grave site is, while The Good only knows which name it is buried under, but of course they can't trust each other with that information. While other western director like to cut to the chase and draw out the scenes violence such as Howard Hawks and Sam Penkinpah, instead on the other hand , something I particularly love most about Leon is how he always extends all precursors before a shot out or a act of violence which eventually end rather quickly . It's better that why, because we invest ourselves deeper into the characters, whilst also allowing the tension in the scene to build up to almost excruciating levels even before the first bullet is fire. What I also love about The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, is the moral ambiguity that runs thick throughout the film, never are the lines between good and bad really competently drawn through. I guess that it down to the decision to keep back stories and exposition rather low. But what it does offer you is the freedom to choose what side you cheer for because there isn't any real distinct good guy in the film, which makes it all the more exciting. At a lengthy 2hrs and 50 minutes, GBU is almost David Lean and Lawrence Arabia-esk in terms if scope and grandeur, and you can also drew comparisons between the two films in the deployment of the incessant use of panoramic shoots of the vast scenery and man insignificant compared to it. As long as GBU is, not once to I find the film meandering or tedious, despite its length it was able to move a furious pace, so it felt that we the audience were ourselves almost sucked into the action by an almighty whirl wind.

A three hour journey of excitement that leads you to the long awaited and explosive climax.

Sergio Leone's directing with the three leading actors makes this one of the best films i have ever seen... Perhaps the best. Actually yes, this is my favorite movie of all time and i don't see that ever changing.What makes 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly' iconic ranges from many things such as Ennio Morricone's memorable score not only defining this movie, but spaghetti westerns, to its unforgettable scenes, depicting beauty and grit in the world created by Sergio Leone. Watching the movie feels like listening to a long musical composition, watching it build and build into a heart pounding crescendo, at the same time basking in the scenes where time feels like it slows down so we could soak in the beauty that this ugly, fragile world has to offer.What I love about this film, is how it can be light-hearted and fun, yet still feel deep, heavy and contemplative at times. We don't get to know the characters at all (except a bit about Tuco), but we get to know them through their actions, and we truly find out the nature of why these three characters have these titles of 'the good,' 'the bad,' and 'the ugly.' To see these characters interact is a treat to watch, but what captivated me about the film was the great Clint Eastwood and his performance at 'The Man with no Name' or 'Blondie' as Tuco would address him as. He is the definitive embodiment of the stoic, anti-hero with an air of mystery as to where he comes from and his motives, which is what kept me in suspense through out the movie. From his strategic thinking in outsmarting Tuco, he is basically floating through a world of chaos, adapting to any unexpected messy situation these characters get thrown into. Then, when we finally get to the ending, we don't know what will become of the characters and that unpredictability is what makes this one moment in the movie one of the most intense scenes in cinema. Without spoiling anything, all I could say is that I felt the ending was clever in a way I didn't see coming at all.With a great setting, a great score, great performances and a simple, but very great story, this is a western film I highly recommend you should watch, if you have never watched any westerns before. On that note, this is not only a great western film, but a wonderful piece of art from Sergio Leone.

The camera pans across it. Then the shot slides onto a sunburned, desperate face. The long shot has become a closeup without a cut, revealing that the landscape was not empty but occupied by a desperado very close to us.In these opening frames, Sergio Leone established a rule that he follows throughout \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.\" The rule is that the ability to see is limited by the sides of the frame. At important moments in the film, what the camera cannot see, the characters cannot see, and that gives Leone the freedom to surprise us with entrances that cannot be explained by the practical geography of his shots.There is a moment, for example, when men do not notice a vast encampment of the Union Army until they stumble upon it. And a moment in a cemetery when a man materializes out of thin air even though he should have been visible for a mile. And the way men walk down a street in full view and nobody is able to shoot them, maybe because they are not in the same frame with them.Leone cares not at all about the practical or the plausible, and builds his great film on the rubbish of Western movie clich\u00e9s, using style to elevate dreck into art. When the movie opened in America in late 1967, not long after its predecessors \"A Fistful of Dollars\" (1964) and \"For a Few Dollars More\" (1965), audiences knew they liked it, but did they know why?I saw it sitting in the front row of the balcony of the Oriental Theatre, whose vast wide screen was ideal for Leone's operatic compositions. I responded strongly, but had been a movie critic less than a year, and did not always have the wisdom to value instinct over prudence. Looking up my old review, I see I described a four-star movie but only gave it three stars, perhaps because it was a \"spaghetti Western\" and so could not be art.But art it is, summoned out of the imagination of Leone and painted on the wide screen so vividly that we forget what marginal productions these films were--that Clint Eastwood was a Hollywood reject, that budgetary restraints ($200,000 for \"Fistful\") caused gaping continuity errors, that there wasn't a lot of dialogue because it was easier to shoot silent and fill the soundtrack with music and effects. There was even a pathetic attempt to make the films seem more American; I learn from the critic Glenn Erickson that Leone was credited as \"Bob Robertson\" in the early prints of \"Fistful,\" and composer Ennio Morricone, whose lonely, mournful scores are inseparable from the films, was \"Dan Savio.\" Even Eastwood's character, the famous Man With No Name, was an invention of the publicists; he was called Joe in the first movie, Manco in the second, and Blondie in the third.HALF REVIEW BY ----- Roger Ebert", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 4}, "heading": "Best Movie of All Time", "date": "2014-03-20T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2983247", "sentiment score": [0.1153, 0.4058, 0.3438, 0.1072, 0.028]}, {"content": "Unless you hate spaghetti Westerns, this film needs to be in your collection.

The story flows so well and just compliments all of it's characters. By far my favorite character was The Good, played by Clint. He is a bounty hunter who captures The Ugly numerous times just to free him before every hanging and splits the winnings with him. When they learn of a coffin in the desert that has $200,000, they go for it. Of course we have the Bad who is a ruthless killer who also wants in on the doe.The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is a terrific film and I thank all the IMDb users for their useful comments and that pushed me to finally rent this western classic.

It is ironic that, at the time the three Sergio Leone westerns were released, they were largely panned by critics as being poor and even laughable imitations of American-made westerns. The fact that they were filmed in Italy and Spain resulted in them receiving their amusing nickname which was intended to degrade them at the time.Somehow, over the quarter century or so since their release, the critics have tended to change their opinions, and now these movies are generally regarded as classics. Perhaps this is because Clint Eastwood was principally known only as the second banana, Rowdy Yates, in the television series \"Rawhide\" when the films were produced but since then has achieved super stardom. But I also think it goes beyond that. I believe the critics decided to take another look at these films and realized that they had been premature in writing them off. Actually, I believe the three films were considerably better than most of what Hollywood produced. In fact, I think that TGTBATU ranks among the best westerns ever produced bringing to mind the magnificent films of John Ford, the undisputed master of that genre, and his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, the incomparable John Wayne.I have nothing but praise for this film. In fact, I rank it as one of my favorite films of all time. I could write volumes of what is good about this film. But since its qualities have been oft repeated in other viewer reviews, I will focus on what others didn't like about it. Most of the IMDb reviews had only one major complaint: the film is too long. I disagree. In fact, in spite of its nearly three hour length, I was disappointed that it ended. I was so absorbed in the film that I was disheartened to have to return to reality. The combination of story, cinematography, acting and musical score left nothing to be desired other than more of the same! The sequences that seemed to drag on in the opinion of other reviewers were necessary to fully create moods and to drive home important points. For example, the opening sequence might be regarded as needlessly long as Angel Eyes taunts a hapless man over a leisurely meal. But to me, scenes like that are what makes the movie great! The time allows the viewer to fully appreciate the amazing replication of the primitive home and the pitiful life of its dirt-poor inhabitants. I felt as though I was sitting there at the table; I was half tempted to reach for a bowl and spoon to partake of the meal. And all the while the suspense was building towards the inevitable climax. You know it's coming but not when and the length of the scene drives you crazy but makes it all the more satisfying when it does happen.Another example is when Tuco punishes Joe by forcing him to walk through the desert. This is possibly the only time that one might become bored with the film. But again, I think the time for the scene was justified in that we are able to receive the full impact of that experience and enjoy the haunting music at the same time. Joe's subsequent predicament might not have had much credibility had this sequence been abbreviated.In my opinion, one of the essential elements of a great film is creating moods that absorb our attention. This often takes time, lots of time. For example, many of the scenes in the magnificent film \"Dr. Zhivago\" were almost painfully long but they were necessary to create those startling surrealistic moods, and the film would not have been great without them. In many ways, TGTBATU has this same sort of greatness. It is a sweeping epic with very compelling characters and magnificent settings that draws the viewer in and doesn't release him until the closing credits begin to roll. When it's over, you feel that you've been on a long and exciting journey. Such a journey takes time.In summary, if you haven't seen this film, buy it right away.

My expectations were high as this film currently has an IMDb rating of 9.0 and is ranked as the 5th best film of all time (according to IMDb). Needless to say, my expectations for this film weren't just met, but they were exceeded.The film basically follows Angel Eyes (Van Cleef) Blondie (Eastwood) and Tuco (Wallach) who are all trying to find some missing coins which are worth $200,000. Initially, it is only Angel Eyes that is aware of the hidden loot, but after Tuco has a chance encounter with an injured and rather thirsty Bill Bryson (who happens to be the man that Angel Eyes is looking for) Bill Bryson informs Tuco that he will tell him where the coins are hidden as long as he gives him water - he tells him which graveyard it is hidden in, but not the name of the gravestone. Desperate to find out which gravestone the coins are hidden in, Tuco obliges and runs to get water. However, in the few minutes that he is gone Bryson dies and tells a worn out Blondie the name of the gravestone where the loot is hidden. Reluctantly, Tuco decides to nurse Blondie back to health so that he can take him to the gravestone where the loot is hidden. Tuco had been punishing Blondie due to the fact that Blondie double crossed him earlier.There are so may things to praise this film about; firstly we have that fantastic Ennio Morricone score - I loved his music in Once Upon a Time in America and was equally impressed with the score in this film. Who can also forget the iconic signature tune which is played in the opening credits and several times throughout this film? Just brilliant.Then we come to the acting, Van Cleef, Eastwood and Wallach were all fantastic - check out the scene between Van Cleef and the guy that he intimidates at the start of the film. There is no dialogue between the men for a number of minutes as the 2 men just fix each other with icy stares- sometimes the best way to create atmosphere and tension is to use the 'less is more' approach and that perfectly sums up the first 10-15 minutes of this film. Eastwood was also fantastic and I feel that he is at his best when he plays the 'tough gunslinger'. He's a great actor and I feel that nobody combines grit and coolness quite like Clint. Wallach was also fantastic in the role of a fairly dumb outlaw. I thought he was convincing in this role and thought he was a really funny character.For me, the biggest strength of this film lies with Eastwood and Wallach and for the most part it is them that this film belongs to. The continual point scoring and 'one oneupmanship' between the 2 men was hilarious to watch. They both share great on screen chemistry and that for me is one of the main reasons that TGTBATU works so well. Another strength is in the story telling. You are constantly left guessing throughout the film and as a viewer you are never quite sure what is going to happen next which certainly made sure the film held my interest throughout. Although this film is quite long it never felt drawn out and pretty much every scene was relevant in advancing the plot. The film culminates in a rather tense finale which proved to be a great ending to a great film.TGTBATU is an absolute classic and is a film that I would recommend to everyone.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 5}, "heading": "An absolute classic which is rightly hailed as being one of the greatest films of all time", "date": "2013-12-21T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2926133", "sentiment score": [0.0445, 0.1397, 0.2233, 0.3399, 0.2525]}, {"content": "First, if you are not a Clint Eastwood fan, then why are you still breathing?

And then came the superb sequel that was \"For a few dollars more\". And as if that was not enough, Leone made the 3rd chapter of the story of the man with no name. And not only surpassed its predecessors but ended up being (maybe) the best westerns ever made.\"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\" starts when Tuco (Eli Wallach), an Mexican outlaw, finds in the desert a Confederate convoy with all soldiers killed inside a wagon. But one of the soldiers was alive and tells Tuco about a certain treasure he hid in a coffin in a cemetery. Tuco goes to fetch water on his horse, to give to the soldier so that he could speak better, but when he is back the soldier died, and the only one who heard the name of the coffin was Blondie (Clint Eastwood) Tuco's former business partner which was being tortured by Tuco crossing the desert without drinking water because Blondie had betrayed him. Blondie knows the name of the coffin but it doesn't know the location of the cemetery, which Tuco does. Now both bastards have to work together to find and maybe split the treasure. But the mission becomes difficult when both meet Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) a lieutenant of the union army that knew longer about the treasure but it didn't know the name of the coffin. Now the three men who hate each other will have to join and across an America at war to find the mysterious treasure.And why this movie is (in my opinion) the best Western ever made? Again, it was the fault of Leone and the exuberant cast. What Leone made in this film, was bring was what was excellent in the first two films and put it all together in this masterpiece. From the 1st movie is the superb narrative that flows in history always perfectly highlighting their characters in the story with chilling and (believe it or not) reflective dialogs.And of course, Leone also destroys (in a good way) in his amazing direction. Giving not only spectacular and epic duels (which here contains the best ones of the trilogy), but also with breathtaking Italian landscapes serving as the Old West. Thanks to the success of the previous films Leone manages to give the film a huge magnitude, with gigantic landscapes and moments with beautiful scenery. Not only landscapes but presents us with one of the greatest cinematic battles, the Battle of Langston Bridge.But as I mentioned before, Leone uses his genius in both script and direction, giving reflective moments to the story. Not only humanizes his characters, but gives the film a huge critic to America using a Western clich\u00e9. This clich\u00e9 is the civil war, if you look at most Western movies (especially John Wayne's ones) they always had as stage the civil war. And through it Leone makes his criticism. It comes in moments like when Blondie and Tuco met Angel Eyes, they had been imprisoned by Union soldiers. In this open-air prison, the Confederates soldiers are forced to play and sing songs against their will, while the guards torture other prisoners. Clearly a metaphor comparing the Union soldiers to the Nazis, but this is based on facts. In many prison camps during the war, there was heavy torture and even rumors of cannibalism. And even a time when Tuco unwittingly confuses Union soldiers to Confederates ones, because they were covered in dust. Another metaphor trying to say that no matter what side you are, everyone is equal.In performances the movie definitely surpasses its predecessors: Clint Eastwood once again the badass as he ever was in the trilogy. In this film we can see more of his human side and clear, despite his schemes and greed, it has clearly a \"good\" side; Eli Wallach excellent. Maybe his performance certainly reach the performance of Eastwood, as this character that even with \"ugly\" attitudes have a pure side; Lee Van Cleef again superb now as the villain. But maybe he's the only \"bad\" thing in the movie. Not his performance, but his character doesn't has moments of exploration that Tuco and Blondie had, but Leone does an excellent job showing why he is the devil in the movie.In conclusion, Leone did absolutely in his masterpiece the best Western ever made. Thanks to an ambitious narrative that not only gives unforgettable characters but makes a big social criticism. Thanks to a huge and beautiful direction with incredible views that captures tense and epic moments; thanks to a creepy and classic soundtrack by Ennio Morricone; thanks to superb performances; thanks to Sergio Leone with his genius that brought us a masterpiece trilogy that redefined the Western forever, concluding it here perfectly making it legendary.10/10", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 3}, "heading": "The Trilogy: 1st-The AMAZING; 2st-The Epic-Badass; 3st-The BEST Western ever made!", "date": "2013-10-06T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2882247", "sentiment score": [0.0171, 0.0782, 0.181, 0.4867, 0.2371]}, {"content": "The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is the final film of Sergio Leone's The Man With No Name Trilogy. This film is recognized by most as the best film from the trilogy, some argue that it's Leone's best film overall. I, on the other hand, found this film great but it did have it's flaws. I also cannot say this film is the filmmaker's best as I found this film to be equally as good as For A Few Dollars More.This film was mainly written by Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni. Both also collaborated in writing the previous film. I'll start by saying the great things about the film's screenplay. The film is huge in comparison to the previous film and even more when you compare to the A Fistful of Dollars. The best part of the film in my opinion are the characters as Leone and Vincenzoni have created people that are very focused on their goal, but at the same time keeping them interesting by adding personality with these characters which clearly defines them. Though I do wish that Lee Van Cleef's character was written more screen time to allow us to understand more about the character, which Leone did incredibly well for Gian Maria Volonte in For A Few Dollars More. The film's title is ironic because each one of the main characters are just as ugly as the other one, being driven by greed and will do whatever they can to get the gold, even if breaks the partnership between characters. The bad part, nothing ugly, about the film's story is the middle part of the film which at times can become a bit too draggy and doesn't keep me on my toes as it does on Leone's previous films. That is just a minor nitpick as it's still tolerable and it only affects me a few times during my many viewings of the film.Leone's direction and vision for this film is much bigger and concrete. The man knew what he wanted to do for this film and since his other two films he has gained a major boost on his confidence. This made the film feel very patient, showing shots that take it's time in moving on to the next shot or scene. The scope of the film has drastically expanded, showing huge location shots with actors looking very miniature on screen, which at times juxtaposes with the extreme close ups that are also abundant of this film. I think Leone was influenced by David Lean, as moments feel like something that came off from Lawrence of Arabia or at least similarly. Leone is known for creating a memorable climax, and this one may be the most memorable one.The film's director of photography is Tonino Delli Colli who would then work with Leone later on his future films. I wished that Massimo Dallamano came back for this film, the previous film's cinematographer, as he has created a particular style that suited Leone's direction and vision, but Colli didn't do a bad job for this film as he still kept it like a western and increased the scope of Leone's previous films. His work here has definitely become iconic but personally I felt that his best work was Once Upon A Time In America. Leone and Colli's photography shines specifically on moments like the scene with the open desert and the graveyard climax.Ennio Morricone comes back for this film and is definitely his best work. Morricone's score here is much bigger in comparison to his previous work. Morricone's score for this film is much more complex and diverse than his first film with Leone. Leone has created a particular melody and created three styles of delivering it, relating each to a character. Morricone's score stood out the most during the climax as it felt like a throwback to his previous score but interlacing it with his current score. A moment in the POW camp where the prisoners are playing music to drown out torture noises was a moment that showed so much emotion; this was achieved with great acting, beautiful photography, but mostly due to the music. This was the first time I felt that Leone can create something emotional and dramatic, which was not really present on his previous films.The acting spotlight here is equally shared by Eastwood, Van Cleef and Wallach. Eastwood plays it darker in this film, due to his character being very driven to obtain that gold and will do whatever he can to ensure that he'll get it. At the same time, Eastwood is given moments in this film that showcases a humanitarian point of view, which I thought was a nice touch. Van Cleef's character was a little underused in this film as Wallach and Eastwood had a wider screen time, but when he comes on screen (like the introduction of the character) he plays it cool and at times a bit dark. Van Cleef definitely surprised me because I never really saw him as a villain due to his fantastic performance from his previous film. Eli Wallach was like breath of fresh air, his humor and style of acting really drove the film forward and kept the tone light. Leone has brought back familiar faces from his previous films, kind of like a cameo and a treat for people who are fans of his work.The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a very well made film but it's minor flaws prevent it from being perfect. It currently ties with For A Few Dollars More but this is just my opinion of the film at the time of writing. I may end up loving this film a lot more as I grow older and with repeated watching. The film has definitely stood the test of time and remain feeling like a fresh and unique in comparison to the many Western films of that era.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 3}, "heading": "Timeless and Fresh", "date": "2013-10-03T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2880094", "sentiment score": [0.0067, 0.069, 0.3692, 0.4947, 0.0604]}, {"content": "One could make the argument for Godfather, Shawshank, etc. but I'm going with GBU.

Though dubbed \"the Good,\" Eastwood's character is not much better than his opponents -- he is just smarter and shoots faster. The film's title reveals its ironic attitude toward the canonized heroes of the classical western. \"The real West was the world of violence, fear, and brutal instincts,\" claimed Leone. \"In pursuit of profit there is no such thing as good and evil, generosity or deviousness; everything depends on chance, and not the best wins but the luckiest.\" Immensely entertaining and beautifully shot in Techniscope by Tonino Delli Colli, the movie is a virtually definitive \"spaghetti western,\" rivaled only by Leone's own Once Upon a Time in the West (1968).", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 3}, "heading": "Perfect in every way", "date": "2013-08-29T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2859917", "sentiment score": [0.0012, 0.0029, 0.0106, 0.2051, 0.7802]}, {"content": "This film's one of my all time favorites featuring Clint Eastwood*hums the theme song*..You can enjoy what he brought to \"Fistful Of Dollars\" or later on \"Unforgiven\" (you may even appreciate him more for his series of Dirty Harry movies) but Eastwood knew how to deliver his lines and even better he understood the true West as an underbelly of lies, deception, and ultimately money for power..This film, in my opinion, was a social statement meant to make people aware that history authors like to glorify Western folk heroes because of their good deeds, yet also make us aware that every hero had a dark side that showed itself during the course of their lives out West..", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Clint Eastwood-the best spaghetti western actor", "date": "2013-08-16T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2852112", "sentiment score": [0.0059, 0.0123, 0.0318, 0.215, 0.735]}, {"content": "\"The good, the bad and the ugly\" is a western movie and for many people considered to be the best western movie of all times.

The 'Once upon a time ...' movies would see Leone's films take on a much darker turn but although there is quite a lot of violence and death on display here, this is an almost jovial epic, (the humour comes from Leone's subversion of traditional western clich\u00e9s). Almost every sequence feels, and looks, like a classic, (the climatic gunfight has the choreographed precision of a ballet), Tonino Delli Colli's widescreen cinematography is magnificent, and although dubbed, (very effectively), the English translation of the Italian script is first-class.The plot is simplicity itself as Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef search for some buried gold but the plot is only the thread of a much richer tapestry centered round events in the American Civil War. Stylistically and thematically this film would later influence Eastwood as a director.

Watching the movie feels like listening to a long musical composition, watching it build and build into a heart pounding crescendo, at the same time basking in the scenes where time feels like it slows down so we could soak in the beauty that this ugly, fragile world has to offer.What I love about this film, is how it can be light-hearted and fun, yet still feel deep, heavy and contemplative at times. We don't get to know the characters at all (except a bit about Tuco), but we get to know them through their actions, and we truly find out the nature of why these three characters have these titles of 'the good,' 'the bad,' and 'the ugly.' To see these characters interact is a treat to watch, but what captivated me about the film was the great Clint Eastwood and his performance at 'The Man with no Name' or 'Blondie' as Tuco would address him as. He is the definitive embodiment of the stoic, anti-hero with an air of mystery as to where he comes from and his motives, which is what kept me in suspense through out the movie. From his strategic thinking in outsmarting Tuco, he is basically floating through a world of chaos, adapting to any unexpected messy situation these characters get thrown into. Then, when we finally get to the ending, we don't know what will become of the characters and that unpredictability is what makes this one moment in the movie one of the most intense scenes in cinema. Without spoiling anything, all I could say is that I felt the ending was clever in a way I didn't see coming at all.With a great setting, a great score, great performances and a simple, but very great story, this is a western film I highly recommend you should watch, if you have never watched any westerns before. On that note, this is not only a great western film, but a wonderful piece of art from Sergio Leone. From the films I've watched by him, everyone of those films possess that layer of depth to them that feels like that feeling of bliss in life that comes once in a blue moon.

THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY has become one of the most loved Spaghetti Westerns out there and it's easy to see why because it contains all the style and violence that the genre has become known for. It's also easy to see why this film gained so many negative reviews when it was originally released but I think it's safe to say that its reputation of a classic isn't going anywhere. As with the previous two installments, Leone does a masterful job with the style of thing and especially the ending, which is clearly one of the greatest ever filmed. It's really amazing to see what Leone was able to do with the budget he had and the fact that he constantly tried to top the previous film in the series is something mighty impressive. I think most directors would have been happy with A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS but Leone managed to build on that and then build on FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE. Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach are all wonderful in their parts and there's no question that the three of them and their chemistry is now legendary. The violence in the film is often graphic but it's also very realistic and fitting for the subject matter. Then there's Ennio Morricone's score, which is so iconic yet it still sends shivers down your spine each time you hear it. The action scenes are excellently put together including the terrific battle on the bridge as well as some of the comedy relief early on dealing with hangings. If there's one problem with the film I think it runs on way too long for its own good.

And, I'll simply say...I was glad I saw this.There are not too many 3 hour films I can watch and not fall asleep; This is one, LOTR is another and that's pretty much it. Much like LOTR, to me 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' did not make me wanna put the film down, despite watching the 3 hour extended edition.****CHARACTERS****I loved the three main characters so much. Each were twisted, had their evil personality but at the same time each were so lovable. 'The Good' played by Clint Eastwood was actually my favorite, by a little margin. Despite being the good, he did dirty work like freeing Tuco, deserting him, killing people and so on, but he was such an interesting character. Tuco, the Ugly, was extremely lovable and made laugh on many occasions. His character had a lot of attention time and had great character development, just like the other two. I loved the character arcs. You really feel Tuco's need to get revenge on Blondie. It all made sense. The Bad, Angel Eye, was extremely awesome and stole the show much like Blondie whenever he was on screen. Angel Eye was simply evil, there wasn't anything else to him. I loved how at the scene where he interrogates the person, you understand what type of character he is. He is a ruthless, dangerous man who will not stop until each task is 100% complete. ****STORY****The second most important thing with a film is the story, and this film has a great, interesting story that makes you interested all the way until the very end. The story was moving, but it was the characters that moved the film along!****SOUNDTRACK***Normally, the soundtrack isn't a major aspect of a film but boy, this film had a memorable soundtrack.

From it's great direction,acting and score The Good,The Bad and The Ugly is a flawless masterpiece that you'll watch again and again.TG,TB&TU tells the story of three gunslingers named Blondie(The Good,Clint Eastwood),Angel Eyes(The Bad,Lee Van Cleef)and Tuco(The Ugly,Eli Wallach)who are on the search for 300,000$ in gold coins. With Blondie and Tuco teaming up and Angel Eyes not far behind,the three gunslingers will stop at nothing to get the gold even if it means going through the civil war or traveling through sunny,dirty grind of the west. It's an unforgettable journey that the three men and viewers wont forget.TG,TB&TU is a film I love for many reasons and one of the reasons is that it's a brilliant finale to the amazing Dollars or Man with no name Trilogy. With A Fistful of Dollars and For a Few Dollars More,Sergio Leone brought brilliant direction,tension filled standoffs and gunfights and changed the Western forever. But With TG,TB&TU,Leone created an epic film something bigger and larger than the first two films. The gunfights and standoffs are given a much bigger scale and filled with more tension and excellence. TG,TB&TU also succeeds at being a great third film because where in most trilogies the third film is always the weakest,TG,TB&TU is one of the rare occasions in film history where the last film of a trilogy is the best one and tells a great story. Leone obviously wanted to top the first two films and he tops them both in a flawless way and with the greatest of ease. Also, TG,TB&TU is a different film from the first two where A Fistful Of Dollars was about fighting families and For A Few Dollars More was about two gunslingers trying to get an outlaw for gold dollars,TG,TB&TU is about a journey through the West and a Adventure about trying to find gold coins and traveling through Hell and high water to get it. This is the greatest third film ever made and in my opinion when filmmakers want to complete a trilogy TG,TB&TU is a film that should be the template on how to complete a trilogy. Another thing I love about this film and the other two films is the way Leone paints the west the way it was:dirty,dusty and ugly. When you watch the film as a viewer you'll feel like you're in the dust and dirt with the characters giving the film a realistic feel and making you feel like you're in the west. With this film,gone was the white hat/black hat good guy/bad guy characters of the American western films. The characters like Blondie and Tuco aren't painted in black and white,there is a gray area with both of them unlike Angel Eyes who is a clear cut bad guy with no gray area and is vicious from beginning to end. With these characterizations in Leone's trilogy the western film was forever changed and the Western genre after this film became much more gritty and dirty and whether Leone mean't it or not reinvented the Western. The Civil War scenes are breathtaking and gives the film a sense of realism where you feel like you're in the civil war with the soldiers. I also love the fact that Leone shows the Horrors of the Civil War,showing the viewer how dark,brutal and bloody the Civil War or War in general can be. TG,TB&TU despite it's epic running time of 163 amazing minutes moves at a great pace and there is not a wasted scene in the film. This is an epic that feels like it's shorter. The Action and violence in the film is excellent and done in a fast and stylish fashion and will truly blow your mind when the Action happens. The last 20-30 minutes are some of the best moments in film history. Remember when I talked about the great standoffs and shootouts in the first two films? Leone takes the standoffs of the first two films gives us a final,excellent standoff that fits with the films epic tone and is so masterful and truly unforgettable and will stay with forever. This film and the first two films are the reasons Sergio Leone is not only one of my favorite directors of all time but also one of the greatest directors of all time. Clint Eastwood is excellent as Blondie(The Good),bringing an intensity with his eyes,snarl and image,but also bringing a level of depth to the character. Next to Dirty Harry Callahan,The Man With No Name is his most iconic character. Lee Van Cleef is amazing as Angel Eyes(The Bad),a ruthless killer who will kill anyone or do anything to get wants. Eli Wallach gives a brilliant and masterful performance as Tuco(The Ugly),with Wallach bringing humor,intensity and depth to the performance. A great performance. Sergio Leone's direction is excellent and masterful,giving the film an epic scope and landscape. Leone's gunfights and action scenes are excellent and have great suspense and timing. I love Leone's close-ups in the film and you can see the expressions in the actors eyes and what they are thinking. Great job,Leone.Ennio Morricone's score is brilliant,amazing and one of the greatest film scores in movie history. From it's masterful opening theme,the score is intense,memorable and iconic and Morricone's best score although Once upon a time in the West's score comes close. A flawless and unforgettable score from Morricone.In final word,The Good,The Bad and The Ugly is a flawless masterpiece from beginning to end that will live on forever and stand the test of time.

I wish my jumpy sequence might not hinder the logical understanding of the film, although it is never a major concern of Mr. Leone and his team.I cannot claim myself an ardent Western genre follower, also without any trickle of fetish towards neither guns or other weaponry, nor killing for fun, plus being an out-and-out urbanite, my natural response over the usual tonal settings of Western films is quite nonchalant (also the bleak milieu is not my preference to admire), what I need to fathom is whether it will evince any on-screen dynamite to maintain a buoyant vibe through its storytelling and action. THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY, without any doubt, has done a crack job here, the lengthy narrative never cease to fall into tepid, three leading characters are richly depicted with accumulated details and minor plots, Eli Wallach's the ugly, who receives the most amount of screen time and rendered as a complete hypocrisy and opportunist, is the arch-protagonist, Eastwood and Van Cleef's roles are less colorful but more pragmatic to be idolized in the hero and anti-hero cinema realm. One cannot evade Morricone's masterly work (not only in Leone's filmography), but here, his knack of enhancing the whole film's temperament has been comprehensively facilitated, the hyena-mimicking theme tune for me is something worth persisting for my entire life. The very much discussed and highly appreciated Mexican standoff could be regarded as the pinnacle of the wholesome western films, Leone's obsession with relentless close-ups is another trademark of its own kind. Leone's film career is an underachieved one, and most of his fame has been accruing after his untimely decease in 1989 at the age of 60, with only 7 feature films under his rein (another one I have watched is his swan song ONCE UPON A TIME IN America, 1984, 8/10), if only he could live a bit longer, his feat would easily stride outside his comfort zone and evolve himself and his work with the time, like what Martin Scorsese has attained.

Most people generally root for that scoundrel, Tuco Benedicto Pacifico Juan Maria Ramirez - known as the rat! What I enjoyed was that Blondie was never *too* Good, while Angel Eyes was so good at being oh, so bad. Tuco, being the Ugly? You understand why he resorted to his ways as his character developed, and you tend to actually root for him. But you still never want to turn your back on him. One of my favorite intimate scenes was Blondie, taking a pause from a pursuit, crossing paths with the soldier. Not one word is said, but the moment between them is truly touching. The only person we truly don't get too close to, is Angel Eyes, but you simply don't feel cheated by that. The cinematography is exquisite. Whether it was the DP, Tonino Delli Colli, or the vision of Sergio's direction, you find a depth to the film like never seen before. The deep focus, using wide angle lenses to maintain focus from, say, a shoe in the foreground to people yards away, to the truly extreme closeups of only shifting eyes, is cinematic genius. There is not one actor that's off in this film. And the writing - three men pursuing a hidden treasure, through the back yard of the Civil War - is outstanding work, with just enough comic relief to give you a chance to relax from the countless number of climaxes throughout.\"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly,\" is the benchmark of not only westerns, but of filmmaking in general.

The complex relationships between the three protagonists had me on the edge of my seat throughout the film, never knowing if they were going to work together or kill each other in cold blood.The soundtrack too is utterly iconic. While I associated the predecessor's tones with cowboy music, I often associate the whole Western genre with The Good, The Bad And The Ugly's backing tune. It has also become quintessential as the accompanying music to any stand off, whether it be in a parody or simply on the school playground.Any fan of the series will know that Eastwood's character appears alongside van Cleef's character in For A Few Dollars More.

Much of this is due to the fact that Wallach is, simply put, one of the best and most versatile actors of the last six decades, but much also has to be granted to the film's screenplay, penned by Leone, Agenore Incrocci, and Furio Scarpelli, from a story by Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni. It crackles with depth, humor- especially quotable one and two liners, pathos (see the scenes with Union and Confederate soldiers), and rage, and is one of the rare films that deserves the moniker epic.The Good, The Bad And The Ugly, despite some flaws, is a great film, for it is so engaging and well written that it moves far faster than its three hour time, actually 'feeling' more like a 90 minute film; an effect that often occurs in the long and slow films of Bela Tarr. From its opening credits to its end the film never takes itself seriously, which helps mitigate said flaws, and the trilogy, as mentioned, and as a whole, is probably the best example of an artist recognizing his own flaws and correcting them with each subsequent film.

But despite all this-or maybe because of it-the film is a three hour spectacle of shameless thrills that will glue you to your seat.The film revolves around three crooks searching for $200,000 in stolen gold. It is not \"good guys against the bad guys\", but who will win among the bad guys. Don't expect morality tales like Dancing With Wolves, Shane or John Wayne movies. All the protagonists are mainly selfish opportunistic greedy killers wanting to steal the proceeds of a heist by another bunch of killers.Clint Eastwood is \"The Good\", an anti-hero, a crook who masquerades himself as a bounty hunter. He is The Man With No Name (Nicknamed Blondie by his Mexican ally) who has his own code of honour. He does not hesitate to kill without mercy when threatened but is not a sadist. In fact, he shows little acts of kindness like when he shares his cigar with a dying confederate soldier. He does not talk much, using his eyes and his gun to do the talking for him. In all of Eastwood's strong silent roles, I consider this his most riveting.Lee Van Cleef \"The Bad\", paradoxically named \"Angeleyes\" is the opposite of Clint. He is a gun for hire, a soldier of fortune(literally) and one ruthless bad ass. He relishes his killings and indulges in sadistic torture to get what he wants. In a brutahl scene, he kills two men who hired him to kill each other. One was a cripple with a family, the other a sick old man in his bed. Cleef played this bad ass role with an aplomb that will always make him a powerful screen presence in all his movies. His menacing evil and \"don't mess with me\" attitude is obvious even when he is motionless.Eli Wallach in the role of \"Tuco The Ugly\" is not much better than Angeleyes, except that Angeleyes is more refined in his crimes. He is a Mexican bandit whose list of crimes include robbery, murder, rape, and having sexual relations with a \"female member of a white race\". He is the most complex of the characters who oscillates between being Blondie's friend/ally, and his deadliest enemy. Eli Wallah was born for this role. Even though he has third billing, he is the most recognizable character and effortlessly stole every scene he was in with his garrulous comic antics. And that makes us perversely love him, even more than Blondie.Worthy of mention, is Ennio Morricone's score. Check out the incredibly haunting score during Tuco's mad dash in the cemetery or the mournful score in the prison camp. They were amazing but both pale to nothing in comparison to the film's incredible score in the credits. It will stick in your mind forever. It is easily the most recognizable film score in the world.Sergio Leone delivered a masterpiece and none of his films can hold water to it. In fact no Western can be compared to Leone's masterpiece. He captured the grit of that era like no mainstream Hollywood Western can achieve. The barren landscapes, the deserts, the bleak depressing environment, the hard characters with their lined faces and hard eyes. The gun duels are exaggerated but beautifully executed and the last triangle duel had a touch of spiritual poetry which is hypnotic.This film is stunning and remains one of my favourite film and definitely my favourite Western.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "The Good, the Bad & The Ugly... and The Masterpiece", "date": "2012-03-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2577711", "sentiment score": [0.0258, 0.1519, 0.3139, 0.4163, 0.0922]}, {"content": "At three hours in length, the word epic can be applied to Sergio Leone's western.

With a script that violently veers from traditional Western themes, Sergio Leone's artistic classic changed American culture as much as Woodstock did. Only a book could detail all the interesting aspects of the film, but here, I will comment on the music. Music is universal and sometimes music strikes us in a way we're not even conscious of, and it draws us with a power and mystique we can't yet identify and probably don't give that much thought to at first. Don't we often respond first by liking or disliking something before we know how to analyze why? So it was with the music in the Good the Bad and the Ugly. All I knew was that the music created an alluring mood in a mysterious and enticing way, giving the sense of what film critic Bill Warren calls an \"astonishing score.\" The music is, in fact, exceedingly more than mere background or accompaniment to the film's action; its \"lonely, mournful scores are inseparable from the film\" (Ebert). Critic Vince Leo says that Morricone's score enabled the film to go from \"good film to masterpiece.\" Not only that, \"Unlike most films, where the composer would create the music based on what happens on the screen, it is said that Leone worked the opposite way, constructing scenes to fit the pieces of music\" (Leo). One might say that with The Good the Bad and the Ugly, we enjoy a film made for its soundtrack rather than a soundtrack made for a film. If asked to describe the music of the film without reference to research, I would have described it like this: full of melody, a whistle pipe sound, rattle snake clicking at times, escalating tension on some kind of stringed instrument, slightly orchestral sounds, choral\u2013like chanting voices, dramatic and paced buildup of tension\u2014all of which was not overpowered with bass, rhythm, and vocals, meaning therefore not a band trying to create a full sound at high amperage. Somehow the music linked to the action, or shall I say non-action; for the music came into presence most it seemed when the characters stopped, spoke little, and hovered on the verge of a new twist in the drama: someone was about to draw, see an ominous presence, or experience an encounter of deep pathos and random violence\u2014violence random to the victim but part of the consuming scheme of getting the gold buried in the graveyard somewhere. The famous signature score for the film came to signify in popular culture, a dramatic moment with peril in the air, a kind of pop icon score tied to antiheroes and subjugation of one person's dreams to those of another. A look at the critics fills in the detail that clarifies exactly what Morricone did. Max Garrone calls the film \"balletic violence,\" with its \"grand arias of whoops, whistles, Jew's-harps, gunshots and other errata.\" Also, we learn that the sound comes from a \"blend of guitars, drums, and hyena-like cries from the singers\" (Leo). Getting more precise, Warren points out that Morrricone, \"blends elements of Mexican mariachi music with contemporary jazz, sweeping orchestral passages, choral voices, and an overall vividly distinctive approach.\" The music so much penetrates the film that it \"incorporates the howl of a coyote\u2014the first thing we hear in the movie itself\u2014into the themes he creates for each title character, though the wail is orchestrated very differently each time\" (Warren). Director, Serge Leone, then must mean for us to hear the coyote's pathos in each character, whether good, bad, or ugly\u2014a wail that gives us the prime musical elixir that penetrates and binds together the film's tone of deep pathos.

In fact the blu-ray I rented looked pretty awesome.The tale of the three titular desperados is long and elaborate. How long? How about 3 hours long. Long enough to have two on screen deaths and a full meal eaten before a line of dialogue is uttered.The Good is Clint Eastwood, a rough n tough cowboy who plays as fair as you play him. He sports a perpetual three day growth and an equally permanent short cigar propped out of the corner of his thin lips.The Bad is Lee Van Cleef, a dodgy soldier on the lookout for a man with one eye, for reasons that I will explain later.The Ugly is the only guy with a name used regularly, Tuco (Eli Wallach). In fact Tuco is pretty much the star of the show, though Good n Bad get their moments.Good, Bad and Ugly are eventually all in pursuit of the same target, stolen gold coins, the whereabouts of which are only known to a one eyed soldier who sports a patch.The greater part of the film plays like those riddles where the farmer must get the chook, the fox and the wheat from one shore to the other without something eating something else, only he can only fit one thing in his boat at a time. The Bad knows the location of the gold, the Good knows not the location but specifics once you get there, and the Ugly is the key to bringing all loose ends together.Each of the grimy trio spend ample time getting to know \u2013 and beat the shtuffing out of \u2013 each other. They take turns leaving each other for dead and at various times all seem to hold the upper hand, only to have it taken from them.There are loads of close ups highlighting shifty eyes, many slow drawn out scenes including what must be the longest Mexican stand off on history, and I must say the makeup jobs were quite well done. As the film is set in the US civil war era some of the settings are surprisingly intricate and feature a cast of thousands of well costumed extra, further dispelling any notion that I had of a 'spaghetti Western' being a cheap knock-off, and though the length and long periods of inactivity were a little different to my modern day ADD sensibilities I was rarely bored, which in a three hour 45 year old film might be the strongest recommendation I can give.Final Rating \u2013 7.5 / 10. I wish I could explain it better but the circular sounding whistle that forebodes every gun fight (and parody) know to film originated in this film.

Soon tiring of Tuco's behavior, Blondie ends their volatile partnership and heads off on his own.Angered by the double-cross, Tuco exacts a laborious revenge on Blondie, but just as the punishment reaches its zenith under a burning hot sun in a remote part of the desert a wagon carrying dead Confederate soldiers interrupts. With his last breath, the sole surviving Rebel tells Tuco of a stash of treasure buried in a cemetery, and, while Tuco is distracted, tells Blondie what grave it is buried under. Their difficult partnership is quickly restored as they trek across the West, through Civil War conflicts, towards the treasure.So far I've only covered the Good and Ugly. The Bad just so happens to be Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), a ruthless mercenary who has also learned of the hidden loot and eventually crosses paths with his rivals. He has the least screen time, but is necessary as a pure villain to lessen the crude vulgarity of Tuco.It's a long film. But it's not about the destination, it's about the journey, and Sergio Leone allows himself plenty of time and space to indulge in quirky idiosyncrasies. I especially like Tuco having a bubble bath in the midst of his current location being blown to smithereens.Villains always interest me, and actors mostly choose villains over heroes as they make for better characters. Blondie may comfort dying soldiers and play with kittens, but he's just too bland. Angel Eyes, is hardcore, and a better character, but he's nothing compared to Tuco. Eli Wallach owns this film, and takes most of the screen time away from Eastwood and Van Cleef. The scene where he searches the cemetery, as the camera spins around and around and around has such a beautiful innocence to it. Even though Tuco may have killed and robbed many this scene makes him seem like an easily excitable child at heart.

This movie slouches nowhere and every aspect of it is masterful. Clint Eastwood is back as \"The Good\", this time known as \"Blondie\", and is as great as ever. Lee Van Cleef returns as well, but not as Mortimer. He plays \"the Bad\", Angel Eyes; a completely different character. Angel Eyes is cunning, obsessively brutal and if you look closely maybe a psychopath. You've got to admire Cleef's capabilities as an impersonation actor. He's a whole another character than he was a year ago in \"For a Few Dollars More\". And Eli Wallach \"the Ugly\" a.k.a. Tuco, a truly great character. One might presume him as the comedic relief, and while definitely hilarious, that's hardly his role. The writing gives him depth, even a peek into his younger years which is why the writing is so great. And before I delve elsewhere, let me be clear this installment is indeed a prequel.Many other great characters appear in the film, like the sadistic Corporal Wallace played by Italian actor Mario Brega , the left-handed gun-slinger out for revenge (Al Mulock, R.I.P.), who serves as the basis for one of the greatest lines of all time, courtesy of Tuco:\"When you have to shoot, shoot! Don't talk.\" Aside all these, my favorite would have to be the Union Captain, played by Aldo Giuffr\u00e8 . The character is not a reflection of only great acting, but also serves as the symbol of what the whole movie is about.The focal point of the movie would definitely be the devastation that war brings, and the many live sit tends to waste on useless efforts. All three of the titular characters, though motivated by greed no less, can't look away from the mutilation before their eyes. This tragic theme is brought out to its fullest by Ennio Morricone, our composer. This has got to be one of his best scores ever, the rawness of it. He captures the fighting spirit beautifully. One of my favorite scene sin film history would have to be when Angel Eyes finds the battered Confederate regiment, and the glorious cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli actually shows the villain step out of the darkness, even if only for a moment, to observe the plight of the soldiers. The music really adds to it, but enough. After all there is a limit to how you can write on IMDb.Anyways, this film sports truly awesome characters, clever writing, beautiful cinematography, and a timeless score. And oh yes the greatest gun-slinger duel of all cinematic history.

After all he was going to see The Good the Bad and the Ugly, an epic 3 hour movie. The movie starts, it blows the young man's, my, mind and suddenly it ends. 3 hours have gone and I haven't touched my popcorn and only once sipped from my soda. This movie changed my perception of the art of film.The Good the Bad and the Ugly is not only the greatest western ever made, it's one of the best and epic pictures ever. Still in my opinion probably the most underestimated movie. While watching this masterpiece you can enjoy it with all senses. The scenes are beautiful in many ways, the music is spectacular in itself and really carries the film into new dimension, the story itself is grand and ambitious and the characters revolutionary for their time played by fairly good actors. It seems there are not enough adjectives to describe the greatness of this movie.Sergio Leone had a very unique style in his movies, which I think culminates in The Good the Bad and the Ugly and in this film you can see this style has grown mature to its true glory. There is something unbelievably beautiful in those wide screen shots of rough plains and desert terrain, the close-ups of faces time after time and long drawn scenes where tension can grow. Sometimes it almost seems Leone was testing how long he can hold on a single scene. The visual art itself tells a million stories without any words needed. For example it takes almost 10 minutes in before anyone says anything at all. Still you can sense the film and the tension. Another one is the final \"triello\" where the main characters stare at each other for what at first seems like an eternity, but before you know it, one of them lies in a grave dead. What other director has the guts to extend his scenes to the ultimate? And all the worn faces? They all have a story of their own to tell about their scars and wrinkles and adds to the epicness. The desert scenes are like from a surreal and captivating painting. A glorification of visual art!The music by Il Maestro Ennio Morricone is epic itself, bold and different. The score of this film is not like any other. At times it makes you cry, at times it makes you excited. It sometimes adds to the visual of the movie and sometimes supports and carries the viewers through those long scenes making sure you will not be bored for even a second of those 179 minutes, making it an experience you will not forget. Not only the main theme, but any piece of music played is a symphony of its own e.g. \"The Ecstacy of Gold\", \"La Storia di un Soldato\" and \"Il Triello\" just to mention a few. The work of a genius!The story about three greedy renegades searching for a case of gold coins is a good story in itself, but it certainly doesn't end there. The story has many levels. For one there is the Civil War and when you start to dig deeper into the story you can truly see the anti-war reflections and symbols. For one condemns concentration camps in WW2 and other wars and also shows how brutal the trench wars of WW1 could have been for the gain of nothing. The film also shows how towns get filled with veterans without legs or arms and cemeteries grow gigantic in days. The crimes of the Good, the Bad and the Ugly suddenly seem minimal in scale in comparison with the war. Another thing is, we really don't seem to get any information about the lead characters and only Tuco seems to have a background. Still we see these three know each other from a long time ago as they refer to each other as \"old friends\". There is some serious tension going on between the three of them. The Ugly is a criminal of the worst kind who cheats everyone and has an obscene language. The Bad is pure evil incarnate and seems to have no feelings at all. He calmly shoots everyone in his way in search for the gold. The Good you cannot really figure out. He is a mysterious and obsolete character who seems to be above all moral, but in the end shows he has some feelings after all. You can't really say he is a good person though, being a quite controversial character.In a sense I think it is, or at least was, the most underestimated movie of all. At the time it was made critics hated it. It's not a Hollywood production, Leone was at the time unknown in the world, so was Eastwood just being in the beginning of his career. Eli Wallach wasn't that famous either and Lee van Cleef was a forgotten movie veteran. It contained brutal violence and it was dubbed and worst of all, westerns was a dying genre. But this movie only grows with time. Not only did it solely revive the westerns, it recreated the movie hero to its modern shape: the controversial Clint Eastwood character. Its score was revolutionary and has affected to modern film score probably more than any other. Still it remains unique. No one has been able to copy the style of Sergio Leone.To me The Good, the Bad and the Ugly truly is the greatest movie ever made in almost any aspect you can measure it in.

There are few words that describe the brilliance of such a movie, but considering as how this film remains (to this day) to be one of my all-time favorites, I thought I should compose a few to express my fond opinion about it for anyone who has not yet experienced the pleasure of seeing it.To put it simply, this movie is utter perfection; the endless landscapes, the classic gun skirmishes, the solid performances, the incredible soundtrack... No western has even caught GLIMPSE of the heights to which this film soars, let alone reached them. This is not just the greatest western, it is one of the best films ever made, with almost no notable exceptions.The music is utter brilliance. The theme song will be playing through your mind for weeks, if it has not already. Ennio Morricone is at his all-time best here, delivering one of the most poetic and outstanding soundtracks for any western (or, arguably, any film), period. And yes, Metallica fans, THIS is the true way that \"The Esctasy of Gold\" is meant to be heard: in its original version.The camera-work is also of high notability. From the huge wide-angle shots of the walloping scenery to the close-and-tight views of the characters' narrowed eyes, the contrast in camera shots will turn even the slower scenes into sheer excitement.Storywise, this film is without equal. The beautiful simplicity of a bounty hunter-turned-treasure hunter, his unlikely bandit partner and their evil rival racing to find $200,000 in Confederate gold is truly spectacular; but what makes it even more memorable is the broadness and scope on the jarring reality of the Civil War. In truth, this story isn't just about three men, but rather three men and their journey amidst the brawling past of a struggling nation, which is depicted fantastically. And the finale of the Trio Duel has got to be one of the most cinematically and musically excellent sequences ever captured on camera. Some may cringe when they learn that the film lasts a good 2.5 hours, but nowhere has a film of this length felt more fitting.To describe the cast is nearly impossible. Lee Van Cleef puts up one of his greatest performances here--he seems BORN to play \"Angel Eyes\". His presence on-screen is truly what drives the story and conflict. Eli Wallach delivers an outstanding role as Tuco; his hilarious dialog and occasional brawls with Blondie make him by far one of the most memorable characters to graze any form of theater. Clint Eastwood is truly something to behold. Although Clint is definitely one of my favorite all-time actors, this is not quite my absolute favorite performance of his (admitedly because he's not quite as bad-ass as in, say, A Fistful of Dollars); however, this point is hardly worth mentioning, because his role as Blondie adds the perfect contrast to the others' personalities. While Angel Eyes and Tuco are considerably violent-natured, Blondie is much more passive; he rarely partakes in conflict except when he absolutely has to, but when he does he delivers the ultimate punishment to anyone dumb enough to stand in his way. In some ways, I think the movie wouldn't have been nearly as effective if Clint's character had stolen the show. Either way, every character is simply rounded and chiseled to perfection; there is no room for improvement here.To sum it all up, this movie is simply breathtaking. It's absolutely fantastic; it's utterly brilliant. The music, the plot, the characters, and the incredible direction of Sergio Leone make this \"Spaghetti-Western\" hardly JUST a spaghetti-western and hardly worth any point of criticism. I have rated this movie a 10 because, unfortunately, there is no higher number available to select (believe me, I would rate this film a 200 if I had the chance). If you have yet to see this film, you must make it an objective to watch it--regardless of whether you like the genre or not. If you've been searching for a film that you could finally term \"THE BEST MOVIE EVER,\" then look no further.

This movie is excellent and its story has a lot of ups and downs, the movie also has the famous western movie star Clint Eastwood. So I was mesmerized by the movie and recommend others to appreciate it.The movie has three leading roles which has different characters. The good person is called Blondie. The bad person is called Angel Eyes. The ugly person is called Tuco. The story happened during American Civil War, and developed gradually among the three western cowboys.Along with the story developing, a man tells the ugly man that there has a huge government wealth worth $200,000. The man tells the region of secret wealth, and the region named Sad Hill Cemetery has thousands of graves. However, the man does not tell the ugly man what the name of the grave which conceals the wealth, but tells the good man. Thus, the good man and the ugly decide to find the wealth jointly. Meanwhile, the bad man who disguises as a Union soldier also begins to find the huge wealth, and the three people meet in battle coincidentally. Then, they against each other by fist and gun fight intensely. Finally, after a lot of fights, the good man and the ugly man find the way to Sad Hill Cemetery.However, the way is blocked by the war between Union and Confederate, and the two forces fight constantly in order to occupy a bridge. Finally, the good man and the ugly man destroy the bridge by bombs. In the end, the bad man arrives in the region of secret wealth at the same time. The three cowboys decide to gun duel and the winner can get the wealth. Finally, the good man kills the bad man in the duel and releases the ugly man. The good man separate the wealth with the ugly man, and the good man leaves the ugly man in the desert. The final scene is that the good man rides his horse and disappears in the distance.The movie uses third person view to describe the fantastic story. The story depicts three different people deeply. They have different dispositions and distinguish each other brightly. The movie has a strong western atmosphere. For example, the whole story develops in the desert, and this is the typical character of the west of America. The three people have classic cowboy's appearance and trait. They have cowboy wear, especially the classic hat. They have a cool handgun and good gun skill. So they can hit a thin rope from a long distance. They judge other people with narrow eyes.This movie is different with former western movies. People do not divide to good or bad clearly. There is no a totally good person or a totally bad person. The good man also wants to gain the wealth and more money by fighting with others. The ugly man can be touched by some sorrowful things and help others by his own way. All people have two sides, good and bad. This idea in the movie causes big change in future western stories and movies. This movie also uses huge scenes to describe the most destructive of wars. Hundred thousand people die in the war and their bodies fall apart on the desert. This is a big satire of three people shuttle between two armies just in order to find the secret wealth. The movie also uses fierce gun fight to make the story ups and downs. For example, in the end, three people duel each other. They stare each other last 5 minutes and no one open the fire without careful thought. This scene makes audiences feel nervous and exciting.Personally, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is a very legendary movie and shakes me a lot. Thus, I saw the movie 3 times and think it is very wonderful. This movie not only is a lot of intense gun fight, but also reflects people's inner thoughts vividly. The three people have the same purpose but have different characters, so there are a lot of conflicts in the story. In the whole story, many scenes impress me a lot. For example, a command of Union is wounded in the war and will die soon. After the good man and the ugly man destroy the bridge between two armies, the command smiles and dies in happy. This sorrowful fragment reveals that people do not want to battle in war and they want to pursue peace. Another scene is that before the good man and the ugly man arrive in the destination, the good man meets a nearly dead soldier of Confederate. The good man puts his clothes on the soldier's body and gives his cigar to the soldier. The soldier smokes the final cigar and dies. This story tells us how the cruel is in the war.The movie also reflects the spirit of the Wild West. Like in the course book, the three cowboys are strong and do things without the law. They kill people cold and unconcerned. They are individual in most of time and there is no woman to accomplish them. They solve problems by dangerous fight or duel and do things what they want to. They are uncontrolled and use unscrupulous divisive tactics. They pursue the material wealth and have can-do spirit.I love this movie is also because of its wonderful music. In intense gun fight, the music is strong and curse. In sorrowful environment, the music is slow and emotionally. Especially before the end of movie, the ugly man run between thousands of graves to find the right name of the grave which conceals the wealth. The music describe the situation coordinately and becomes classic until today.You cannot miss this excellent movie, despite the language in the movie is Italian, but this does not block you to understand the story.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 3}, "heading": "Excenllent!", "date": "2011-11-28T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2524849", "sentiment score": [0.0073, 0.0443, 0.2433, 0.5558, 0.1493]}, {"content": "Out of all the movies I have seen, this must be one of the few that I have seen over a dozen times already. And that's coming from a non western fan! You clearly don't have to be a western fan to have a love and appreciating for this movie. Every movie lover in general should be capable of appreciating the quality, art and talent that is all present in this movie.It's one of those rare movies in which everything comes together perfectly. The story, the directing, the acting, the settings, the music. Everything fits and works out perfectly. All elements strengthen each other as well. The music strengthens its images, the director its actors, etcetera. Would the movie had been just as good and unforgettable with a different cast? Or different music, or a different director? Probably not. It would be like replacing an instrument in a Mozart composition, or changing some of the colors in a Picasso painting. All of the elements need each other to become the great masterpiece that \"Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo.\" is.One of the reasons why I have always loved this movie is because it's buildup as a real adventurous movie, in which the hunt for a treasure plays a very central role. It takes the main characters to all kinds of different places, where they meet all kinds of different people and each time run into different problems as well. Really, this movie is basically an adventure movie, disguised as a western. It also really makes this movie unique in its genre and so extremely likable and easy to watch, time after time, despite its long running time.Also the interaction between the three main character is just great. They often trade roles and alliances with each other and constantly try to be one step ahead of the other. They never thrust each other and for good reasons. None of the characters are truly good or bad, even though the title of the movie might suggest otherwise.And needless to say that the three main parts are also perfectly cast ones. Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef all rarely have been better. And they also make it real difficult to pick a favorite character. Each of them has their own qualities and certain amount of charm and likability level to them.There is also no big surprise in it that the movie is really skilfully directed and put together by Sergio Leone, who obviously was a master of the genre. He perfectly combines both visual and story elements, with an equal amount of eye for detail for both. He pretty much perfected the spaghetti western genre at the time pretty much on his own and his influences can still be seen back in modern movies now days.One of his finest moments of course comes during its final shootout. But I actually think it are the movie its last 30 minutes in general that are just great, the moment Tuco first enters the cemetery. It's really something that's among the greatest moments out of movie history.The shootout, or Mexican standoff, itself is really nothing short of brilliant. Its compositions, the editing, its close-ups, the Ennio Morricone music. Could had things been more perfect? It has such a great buildup, in which the characters are slowly moving and looking around at first. The music helps to buildup the tension, then it swells up and when you expect things to go down it goes suddenly entirely quiet. However then the music suddenly starts again and the buildup gets even more intense, with fast cuts and even more extreme closeups. Truly one of the best and most memorable movie moments out of movie history.The only shame about this movie is that there are actually still people out there who haven't seen it yet!10/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 4}, "heading": "If more westerns were like this, it would be my favorite genre.", "date": "2011-11-22T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2522472", "sentiment score": [0.0078, 0.0149, 0.0251, 0.2345, 0.7178]}, {"content": "The legendary \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.\" It was a long time coming - \"A Fistful of Dollars\" (1964) was good, \"For a Few Dollars More\" (1965) was better but the best of Sergio Leone's \"spaghetti western\" \"Dollars trilogy\" was/is \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,\" released in 1967. The last film in Leone's \"Dollars\" trilogy is best remembered for two things: for truly being the best film Leone was capable of directing at that time, and for making star Clint Eastwood a household name (he'd been rising overseas due to his starring roles in the two previous \"Dollars\" films). (Eastwood, of course, wouldn't become a big-league Hollywood star until \"Dirty Harry\" in 1971.) The legendary \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" is set during the Civil War, and concerns three men's quest for a fortune in Confederate gold buried somewhere in a cemetery. The three men are: The Man With No Name/Blondie/\"The Good\" (Eastwood), Angel Eyes/\"The Bad\" (Lee Van Cleef), and Tuco/\"The Ugly\" (Eli Wallach). All three have itchy trigger fingers but therein lies the problem: they all know the secret to the location of the buried Confederate gold (one knows the cemetery, but not the grave; another knows the name of the grave but not the cemetery). This film, in its full-length unedited 179-minute running time, may very well be the first epic (spaghetti) western, or at least, the first epic western that I've seen. It's one of the most thoroughly engaging, action-packed, and provocative films I've ever had the pleasure of watching. At center stage is star Clint Eastwood, playing the \"Man With No Name\" for the third and probably last time, and he's at the top of his game here as a truly bad-a** anti-hero. Sure, he speaks softly, but he carries a big six-shooter and he knows how to use it! But don't overlook the contributions of co-stars Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach. It's been a while since I've been so thoroughly captivated by someone as truly evil and sadistic as Van Cleef's steely-eyed killer Angel Eyes; there is also something to be said about Eli Wallach's portrayal of the unkempt, desperate con man Tuco, who also serves as this film's comic relief. Leone was at the peak of his skill in \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,\" clearly the best film of his \"Dollars trilogy.\" His love of wide-angle shots to capture the oppressive desert landscape, and intense close-ups of the actor's faces were unmatched here. It's also the best film of his to make truly excellent use of the extensive talents of the brilliant Italian composer Ennio Morricone (I'm listening to his score for this film right now as I type this up).It only seems fitting that as the western film genre's most iconic star, Clint Eastwood would go on to make his dark, violent anti-western \"Unforgiven\" in 25 years later in 1992.10/10", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Good, better, best!", "date": "2011-11-14T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2518540", "sentiment score": [0.0187, 0.1082, 0.2553, 0.4748, 0.1431]}, {"content": "Absolutely irresistible, The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly is both the quintessential spaghetti western and the ultimate film from director Sergio Leone (not to mention one of the most popular westerns of all time), though For A Few Dollars More and Once Upon A Time In The West are pretty hard to beat. Needless to say, it's hard to talk about this without repeating the same praise others have heaped on this film.Strangely enough, for something that's become known as one of the definitive Clint Eastwood vehicles, the real main character (as far as the script is concerned) is Eli Wallach's Tuco Ramirez. It's through the eyes of Tuco that most of the action is witnessed and all of the character development takes place. As flashy as their roles are, Eastwood's \"man with no name\" and Lee Van Cleef's Angel Eyes seen almost cardboard by comparison.When it comes to deleted and extended scenes, I find myself (surprisingly) in agreement with United Artists' studio hucksters from way back when. Added scenes are either unnecessary and awkward, like the introduction of Tuco's gang, or they interrupt the flow of the story, like Angel Eyes' trip to the pitiful rebel camp. It's much more effective to watch Van Cleef disappear after his encounter with Bill Carson's woman and become almost forgotten, only to reappear at the Confederate prisoner-of-war camp, in time to get in on the action.One surprise that awaits those who've seen the movie multiple times and then listened to Ennio Morricone's soundtrack album, is that the climactic showdown theme Il Triello (the trio) differs substantially on the album from the take used in the final film, with the movie version featuring a callback to the musical pocket watch in For A Few Dollars More and the album version containing an extended horn solo at the end, lasting longer than in the film.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 2}, "heading": "It's All Good!", "date": "2011-11-11T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2517032", "sentiment score": [0.154, 0.4376, 0.1896, 0.1523, 0.0665]}, {"content": "This movie is completely frank.

This movie even has a trademark western theme that will be used in many parodies to come. Like the title there is three main characters in this movie and each one brings a lot to the table, I first thought The Ugly would be the one left in the shadow. But that character stands out a lot to this movie and brings life into it. Despite his devious and mischievous characteristics he is still sort of likable. The Bad is played by Lee Van Cleef and he does a good job of portraying the charismatic and yet ruthless villain in this movie. The good is more of a anti-hero of sort than actually a good guy, but he does still have that code of honor which he carried with him during the previous films. He is cool and calm gunslinger but just isn't the good guy in this story. Anyways the character Tuco aka The Ugly surprising stood out a lot in this, I mentioned it before but he is really good with his role and slightly reminded me of Jack Sparrow when it came to his characteristics and mannerisms. Not a lot but very slightly. Each and every character from the three stands out. And when it comes to the plot it boils down to the three gunfighters going after $200,000 in stolen gold. And it takes place during the civil war so there is many obstacles they must overcome, including each other. Compared to the previous two film in this trilogy this one is most definitely the most character driven one and has a lot of character development.

There are several reasons for this. For one thing, it has never really dated at all in all these years. The immorality of its central three characters is a factor of course. The black and white moral certainties of the traditional American western are nowhere to be found here. One of the reasons for this is the film's Italian origins. The movies of Italy had no qualms with projecting morally ambiguous heroes onto the screen. Nor did they see any issue with and filling their stories with plenty of violence. Add to this, the Italian tradition of operatic drama and you have the basic ingredients of the spaghetti western. The immorality, cynicism, violence and operatic sense of drama were the template where this most American of genres was filtered through, the result was a somewhat distinctive sub-genre.But what makes The Good, the Bad and the Ugly stand out from most spaghetti westerns is because of the personnel behind and in front of the camera. Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and, especially, Eli Wallach all shine in their respective roles of 'the good', 'the bad' and 'the ugly'. While behind the scenes were two monumental cinematic giants in the form of director Sergio Leone and composer Ennio Morricone. These latter two form one of the most outstanding director-composer partnerships in the history of the medium. Leone shoots the film with consummate brilliance, with extreme close-ups and widescreen vistas; he has an understanding of cinematic space like few others, while he paces events within that space in a highly individual way - he takes his time, is quite minimalistic yet is always dramatic and at times epic. Of course the film would not be anywhere near the masterpiece it is without the contribution of Morricone. The soundtrack in this film is quite honestly legendary. If you were to have looked at his ideas on paper without hearing the end result you would be forgiven for thinking that this music would be wildly inappropriate for a western - electric guitars, feedback, chanting, avant-garde elements - yet it hardly needs saying that the result is one of the greatest examples of film music ever composed. It will always remain so.The fact that the film is epic, yet simultaneously tough, muscular and cynical is a somewhat unusual combination. It's storyline of greed, betrayal and brutality is not one usually given the epic treatment. No doubt this is one of the aspects that confused critics back in the 60's who disparaged this film. It does seem extraordinary from a modern perspective that this movie was greeted with a lukewarm reception. But I suppose this may explain why it seems nowadays to not have dated at all - it was clearly ahead of its time.

Or rather this is where it begins (in a minor major plot spoiler). Clint Eastwood for the third time dons his trademark multicoloured poncho to mark his place in the international hall of fame, while Sergio Leone imprints himself as one of the greats of world cinema. After a poorly remade \"Yojimbo\" and a barely passable \"For a Few Dollars More\" Leone manages to take hold of all that worked in his previous movie (long focused eyeshots, Enrio Morricone's soundtrack, quirky but memorable one-liners, the Eastwood character) and molds it together with a very good plot, great cast, witty dialogue and a markedly improved budget. The end product is an absolute classic Western. Despite a wacked-up moral compass it permeates with a sense of profound humanity, which manages to entice in between the wit and humour of the main action. Running a mere 3 hours in the extended version time flies by unnoticed, which says a lot about how well and how entertaining this movie is.The 'bad' is money-hungry (albeit all three of our antiheroes love their piece of gold) and scrupulous hired killer Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef). The 'ugly' is wacky wanted dead or alive criminal joker Tuco (Eli Wallach). The 'good' is a morally ambiguous gunslinger, who seems to be more interested in cash than the idea of right or wrong. In the first scene with him in it we see Clint gun down three bounty hunters simply because they were after the same man. Somehow however in this dastardly world, where the Civil War reigns supreme, his character always seems to come out as the better man. Naturally being the fastest gun in the state with the bestest aim period always helps. Especially when there is treasure buried in a cemetery deep in the Civil War front-line. Given the era in which this is based the moral ambiguity of good seems to speak in volumes that in such times of war and strife the definition itself seems to shift drastically. The grey area is vast in Sergio Leone's wild west and suitably so. Nonetheless both Tuco and Blondie (the Man Without a Name has a nickname) are extremely likable antiheroes, while Angels Eyes makes for a memorable... eee... villain?Given the budget and scope of the production Leone manages to create a shameless epic, where simultaneously the small-mindedness starkly contrasts, but also beautifully completes, the tragic enormity of death and war. The audacity of war seems to be reflected in these petty squabbles over money, as if the war itself is nothing more than such an feeble argument enhanced to the stage of mass slaughter. Within this logic Blondie turns out to be an almost angelic figure, who in all his money warmongering is able to have brief flashes of sincere and unabated selflessness. But than again it hard not to agree with Tuco and he exclamation that Blondie is nothing more than a dirty son of a &^%$*.An absolute classic movie with an influence on Westerns, cinematography in general and pop-culture that is impossible to undermine. The iconic eye shots, music, showdowns and characters remain as influential as they were over 40 years ago.

I am in awe at practically everything about this movie. The story is indelible -- a chase across the wild Civil War laden frontier for a supposed $200,000 of stolen Confederate gold buried in a cemetery somewhere. All sorts of gunshots fired, men fallen, twists and turns of faith within the plot -- you never know what to expect next. The relationship between Blondie (Clint Eastwood) and Tuco (Eli Wallach) is so ambivalent that it's entertaining. Each strands the other in the middle of a vast desert, each has opportunities to kill the other. But ultimately they team up with the common goal of acquiring great riches - - though you never know when someone may turn on the other.The acting is done perfectly. Eastwood plays Blondie to be the quintessential bad-ass, the man we all wish we could be, who's got no fear to kill but ultimately has good intentions. Then Wallach portrays Tuco as \"The Ugly\", which is convincingly done as Tuco is preoccupied with material objects rather than things like faith and friendship. He rushes Blondie to recovery only when Blondie's survival is mandatory to find Bill Carson's hidden gold. Tuco conceals his sins (which include greed, lust, wrath, drinking, etc.) with constant prayer and reference to the Lord. I find this to be especially intriguing. It echoes the real world phenomenon where the most religious people are often the ones who are most befallen by vice. Tuco wants to believe that he's as worthy as his brother (who is leading an actual Catholic mission), but is committed to doing whatever it takes to satisfy himself, at no matter what cost.On that note, I find it amusing analyzing the difference between \"The Ugly\" and \"The Bad\" (which was spectacularly portrayed by Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef)). At first thought, both titles seem negative, but that doesn't mean they are identical. In fact, it doesn't even mean that both are the exact opposite of \"The Good\". While Angel Eyes may be characterized by greed, and finds it acceptable to physically assault prisoners of war and anyone that stands in his way, he is markedly more intelligent and more self-respecting and resourceful than Tuco. At the Yankee prison, Angel Eyes doesn't even bother beating Blondie to get information on the location of the gold, figuring that he's \"smart enough to know that talking won't save (him)\", this just after he tortured Tuco, who succumbed. Angel Eyes clearly views Blondie as a more capable traveling companion. In other words The Bad has a sharp eye for detecting and appreciating the assets of The Good, whereas The Ugly doesn't have much keenness of any kind, only seeking to serve himself through sensual pleasures. Also at the end of the movie, just before the final showdown, Angel Eyes seems to understand the sporting nature of Blondie's wish to duel for the rock at the cemetery's center (which supposedly bears the name of the grave where the money is), while Tuco seems to merely be along for the ride, only accepting the challenge because of the possible reward. Note that The Bad's entertainment seems to normally arrive through mental means -- his battery of the prisoners allows him to assert dominance over them. He \"always sees the job through\", showing resoluteness and conviction. Perhaps this indicates that The Bad is more similar to The Good than The Ugly is. While The Bad may utilize his assets of intelligence, strength, and persistence corruptly, at least he HAS them, like The Good and unlike The Ugly. The Ugly seemingly has no hope to ever become a respectable figure, as he hypocritically worships a god yet displays insolence towards real people and ideas that are worthy of reverence. This complements the idea that being good isn't only about possessing favorable traits and abilities, but also about cultivating them through good habits.There are too many epic scenes in this film to list them all here. There are the escapes of Tuco from the gallows after Blondie shoots the rope that holds him aloft. There's Tuco's surreptitious entry through Blondie's window at the inn, the bathtub gun-pull scene, the bombing of Branston Bridge. The fact that the captain witnesses the explosion of that \"damn bridge\" that he wanted so badly to see annihilated, while he lays wounded and just as he dies quietly upon the neighboring hill.....still gives me chills when I think about it. A truly poetic and uplifting moment that was.But what truly ties all these great aspects of this film together is the musical score by Ennio Morricone. It is absolutely magnificent -- as good as any music you will ever hear. It penetrates the mind and brings the action and emotions of the set and the characters right to you, be it during the ethereal scene that features Tuco's epic frolic through the cemetery in pursuit of the grave, during the three-man shootout shortly following that (which is an incredible innovation by Sergio Leone that makes you wonder how it had never been attempted before), or during the poignant scenes at the Yankee camp when prisoners were forced to play that nostalgic sounding music against their own will. I have never heard a soundtrack so powerful as the one that guides The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, and perhaps that is fitting, since I can't say I have ever seen a film as undoubtedly splendid as The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Maybe the greatest movie ever made", "date": "2011-08-22T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2477656", "sentiment score": [0.0164, 0.0739, 0.1384, 0.5175, 0.2539]}, {"content": "Has 'The Good, The Bad And The Ugly' acquired too much of a halo over the years, putting it beyond criticism? To me it was a rehearsal by Leone for the vastly superior 'Once Upon A Time In The West', my all-time favourite.When I last watched Blondie, Tuco and Angel Eyes I missed the start. The Man With No Name (except the endlessly repeated 'Blondie') was stumbling across the desert. Tuco was carrying on in a sadistically clownish manner that was simultaneously tedious and repellent. It was only sloth that held me in my seat.Most film directors are forever pulling the legs of their audiences. Leone is no exception. Using all sorts of tricks, he allows the story to creak along in the most improbable manner, either hoping that viewers won't notice or don't care. One of Sergio's little jokes is that if something isn't seen by the camera, neither will it be visible to the characters, even though they're looking in different directions. The best gag of this kind is when Tuco and Blondie are captured as they stumble into a huge army camp they somehow fail to spot.In like fashion, useful props materialise out of nowhere. While Tuco scrambles in the cemetery to dig up the stolen gold, Blondie manages to construct a makeshift gibbet from a convenient tree and a length of rope long and strong enough to tie up the 'Titanic'. And where did the the shovels come from in the treasure-hunting scenes? Almost every new twist was improbable.You have to admire the mixture of frailty and resilience of participants in Leone's films. Baddies are dispatched with a single shot. Tucos and Blondies are beaten or baked to within an inch of their lives but bounce back as readily as cartoon characters flattened by steamrollers.Some people don't mind poor lip-synchronisation, including Signor Leone, but I do. The distraction of mouths often moving independently of the words they purport to speak is aggravated by the laboured dialogue. Thank goodness Leone stepped up several gears for 'Once Upon A Time In The West' by using a brilliant writer and employing a much better cast (Henry Fonda, Charles Bronson, Jason Robards, etc) than the irritating Eli Wallach and the dull-as-ditchwater Clint Eastwood.Despite these grumbles, there's a lot to be said in favour of 'The Good, The Bad And The Ugly'.

This sums up the very essence of the 'Western Spaghetti', a pivotal sub-genre that traced the singular evolution, hence the survival, of the Western genre in two polar opposite directions : the \"anticonformity\" and the \"overconformity\" or let's just simplify and say \"demystification\" and \"amplification\".DEMYSTIFACTION: Akira Kurosawa's innovative \"Yojinbo\" ended the classic 'good vs. bad' antagonism, which directly inspired Sergio Leone. Like \"A Fistful of Dollars\", the realism of \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" lies within the lack of morality of the three main characters, each of them has malicious motives. Leone's intuition over using Kurosawa's characterizations proved to be useful for the Western genre that was begging for a metamorphosis. John Ford's era was over, and with all due respect to John Wayne, everyone knew how the West was Won, and were tired of the pompous idealism displayed, despite the breath-taking imagery of Monument Valley. Even the mythic Civil War, the powerful symbol of the fraternal fight that ultimately consolidated the American spirit, is treated like a vulgar subplot, which somewhat betrays the foreign aspect of the film, and in the same way, sweeps off all the dust of semi-propaganda stuff disguised in entertainment. The myth was agonizing, and the 'Western Spaghetti' genre proceeded to a sort of creative destruction.Take the three main characters, the irony in the title, is that all their 'nicknames' are interchangeable, there is something ugly in the bad, and vice versa, and the good isn't 'boy-scout' good. Listen to the opening credits, flute for Blondie, Clint Eastwood as the Good, ocarina for Sentenza, Lee Van Cleef as the Bad and human voices for Eli Wallach as Tuco, the Ugly. Different instruments were used for each but they all play the same iconic melody, inspired from the howling of a coyote. Symbolically, each character is different, but the deadly greed inhabiting their hearts is the same, it's \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" rather than \"The Good vs. the Bad vs. the Ugly\". Their relationships are all tactical, cynical and hypocritical, with friendships based on a mutual need to reach a hidden gold. The Good and the Bad need each other, because they know half the secret about the gold's location, and Sentenza, need them alive to find it. They're all tied to each other until the strongest and cleverest wins; this was the humanistic reality during the dark ages of the last century.AMPLIFICATION: I guess the fact that I watched it for the first time when I was 10, built my personal affection to the film, because at that age, my expectations were not tarnished by the cynicism of the classic know-it-all film buff. For me, the three characters were not similar; the Good was the hero, the Bad, the villain, and the Ugly, the comic relief. They happen to be the only recognizable actors' faces in the film, but it hardly matters because we don't need them overshadowed by other supporting performances. Eli Wallach, in a career-defining role, is the fastest talking and provides the best moments of the film as the indisputable scene stealer. His humor also relies on the exciting duo he formed with Blondie whose cool sense of humor, and cynical detachment proved at many occasions to be the yin to Tuco's yang. And Lee Van Cleef is the senseless, cold-blooded killer who makes the Ugly look Good. He represents the dark side of the film, a man who always finishes his job, and from the first scene involving him, I took him as the bad guy of the story. The characterization is why I loved the film both as a kid and as a movie buff.The line between amplification and parody is very thin, but there's a difference. When parody takes all the conventions into derision, amplification insists on them, providing the typical Leonesque shots. Time is dilated, locations are magnified, like belonging to a unique dimension, and the whole film oscillates between extreme close-ups and extended shots from very far away. All the effects are amplified with cinematic hyperbolas exceeding the limit of believability. In his 'Great Movies' review, Ebert stated that Leone invented a rule which consisted on the characters' point of view limited by the screen. I never understood until I re-watched the film and got it, and I respect Leone even more for having pushed the limits of creativity to this point since most of the greatest effects from the film depend on that rule, and are transcended by the iconic score of the musical genius, Ennio Morricone. \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" has all the tragic, comic, epic and musical elements that makes it a kind of operatic masterpiece.CONCLUSION :Film-making is far from being an exact science, and you can make a masterpiece out of the least complex plot elements, the lowest budget, and the cleverest directorial tricks. Not to diminish the quality of Leone's \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" but the point is that the movie works as if it was self-aware of its own restrictions and transcended it with a magic that another director, wouldn't have judged necessary. Some apparent weaknesses are sometimes the necessary drivers to push the creation to the limit of genius while confidence can work as a tricky obstacle, maybe that explains why \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" is the highest ranked Western on IMDb Top 250 and undoubtedly the most iconic.So, to conclude, I would simply say that there's two kinds of people in this world, those who love the film, and those who don't get it ...", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Authentic in its Ugliness, Intense in its Badness and Operatic in its Goodness ...", "date": "2011-07-30T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2466724", "sentiment score": [0.1839, 0.3816, 0.1982, 0.178, 0.0583]}, {"content": "I don't really believe in lists that much or calling one song, movie or whatever the best since there is a lot to be said about different good things.

The road there, and how it all plays out, is pure movie magic.Right from the start, you know this is going to be an essential. The three men, slowly walking towards each other, then opening the door, BANG BANG BANG... then the Ugly, with his twisted expression and meat in hand, mid jump. Then an epic plot begins to unfurl, and yes, GBU is very epic in every sense of the word, and exceeds its predecessors in every way.The plot of this film is less straightforward than in the previous installments. There are now three characters that demand your attention, and they're all after the same thing. It's like the best treasure hunt ever. While in the other Dollars movies the first 25 or so minutes are cloudy and require lots of thinking to comprehend what's happening, GBU lays it all out to see the whole way through. Filled with great fights, battles and a very tense conclusion, the Good the Bad and the Ugly's story will grab your attention for its 3 hour runtime.I didn't like that Clint had to share the spotlight in A Few Dollars More. But here, it's not only acceptable, but exceptional because of who and what he shares it with. Lee Van Cleef expertly handles the ruthless Angel Eyes, who will do whatever the job as long as he is paid. Eli Wallach becomes Tuco, the crazy bandit whose only allegiance is to himself and his money, and Clint plays Blondie, the 'good guy' , who fights for himself, cash, and whatever else he feels like. 3 standout, differentiated characters, each with names other than their respective actors. It may not be a big deal to you, but I like each character's nicknames.Each character is deep and layered, with moral haze that leads to some very intense scenarios. Who will betray who, and when, is asked by the viewer several times during the run of the film. The characters stand out, and a very well acted.As usual, the music is perfect, drawing from the earlier Dollars movies and creating a new score. It perfectly sets the tone. The Confederate soldiers sadly singing to drown out torture is an incredibly sorrowful tune.The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is brilliant cinema from start to finish. In fact, it is the closest thing I've seen since the Godfather to be considered by me as a perfect film: the plot, characters, music, camera-work and ending are sublime. It's a subtle, stylish masterpiece that shouldn't just be seen by fans of the genre, it should be seen by anyone who likes movies. 9.7/10", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "When all westerns are forgotten...

I just love everything about this film, the writing, the cinematography, the cast, Ennio Morricone's score, everything. Even the title gives the film more depth as the film has to prove to you that Blondie is the good, Tuco is the ugly and Angel Eyes is the bad. Each is proved in a different way. With Blondie, we have serious doubts when we first see the title \"The Good\" under his picture right after he leaves Tuco in the desert. As the movie goes on we slowly come to realize that though he may not be a saint, he is certainly better than his two counterparts, this is proved at the very end when he allows Tuco to keep his share of the gold, even though he could have easily taken it all for himself. This is something we cannot imagine Angel Eyes or Tuco doing. With Tuco, it's different, we first see \"The Ugly\" title when we first see him and we are not even sure what it means, the best conclusion we can come to perhaps is that he certainly doesn't look very attractive in the scene. But we later see that 'ugly' is meant to mean pitiful in this situation, because although Tuco is a vile character, we pity him because we find out about his past. Finally there's Angel Eyes, with him we have no doubts about the text \"The Bad\" which appears after he murders his employer, this certitude of his evil nature is reaffirmed throughout the film. So the character development in this film seems not so much to be with the characters but with our own perception of them.Opinions vary about what the film really is. Is it a satire of westerns? Is it a an antiwar film? Is it camp? Is it art? Is it all of these things maybe? I think perhaps Leone left the film to the viewers own interpretation, and that, I suppose, is the way art is.This films does have a few small flaws: 1.The Ecstasy of Gold scene is a little unbelievable, could a person like Tuco, who seems to struggle with reading, find the name on a grave while running through a graveyard in circles? This scene is also a little hard to watch because the camera follows Tuco very fast, causing the screen to blur. This does work artistically however as it seems to have present a \"blinded with greed\" metaphor. 2. There are a few other unrealistic scenes, such as the one where Tuco and Blondie walk through an abandoned town and kill Angel eyes men , conveniently placed cannon shots aid them and they kill men shooting from the hip, while the Angel Eyes men carefully aim and miss. The flaws in this film are easily outweighed by it's strengths however: 1. The characters are very well written and portrayed. 2. The pacing is superb (it seemed no longer then A Fistful of Dollars really). 3. The story, while not one of the films stronger aspects, is still very good. 4. The dialog is brilliant. 5. It has one of the greatest scores of all time. 6. The cinematography is stunning.

He demonstrates a great understanding towards his character and is full of heart. He also carries the film very well, because of this. Eastwood is slick, causing unbelievable chemistry between his and Wallach's character. Lee Van Cleef is amazing in his brief, yet undeniable role.Sergio Leone's direction is sophisticated and full of depth. The kind of camera angles used are beautiful. Cinematography is staggering, just at the right speed.I haven't a heard a better soundtrack from any film. The laughable and hilarious skills used to put them in this film are shady. The main theme is one of my most favorite parts of this film.Storyline is at time silly, but its so hilarious that its hard not to see this film.

To underline and celebrate this kind of anniversary, I decided to pick one of my favourite movies of all times.Everything about this movie just seems perfect to me.Let's start with the director's work. Sergio Leone is one of the most gifted directors of all times and he had a feeling for monumental and impressing landscapes. His images are as epic as the scripts and stories. I also adore the way he captures the emotions of its actors. The devil is in the detail as he concentrates on seemingly instinctual nervous movements and actions, the impressions of the actor's faces and especially the looks of their eyes. Even almost fifty years after the release of this monumental milestone of the western genre, his way of filming remains unbeaten and unreached. It is emotional, well crafted and perfectly organized.The filming goes hand in hand with the majestic score of the movie. Ennio Morricone is maybe the greatest composer for cinema alive. The instruments are diversified, the melodies epic and still catchy and filled with emotions of pressure, anger, despair, hope and joy that fusion perfectly with the chosen images. Without the music, often only chosen randomly to underline a conceptual background by many others, the movie wouldn't be the same. Sergio Leone really knew what he wanted and I music has never had such an important role in a movie since the end of the age of silent films. Without the works of Morricone, there would have been no place for many grand composers such as John Williams or Hans Zimmer that create stunning soundtracks nowadays.Another amazing thing is the acting around the three key personalities. Lee van Cleef as Angel Eyes does the best work of his career as a cold hearted, pitiless and cool villain with an eerie look. He is not the usual bad guy but a rather silent, patient and intellectual villain and this what makes him appear so cruel and dangerous. Eli Wallach as Tuco, one of my favourite actors of all times, does also the best job of his long career in this movie. He plays an ugly little bandit that seems to be naive, superficial and rude at first sight but turns out to be much more diversified and is finally a crafty, darkly humorous and brutal villain that is nevertheless very sympathetic because of his high degree of charisma and the high amount of bad coincidences that he lives throughout the whole movie. Finally, Clint Eastwood as Blondie does also an amazing job and has developed since the first two movies he had done with Sergio Leone before. In this movie, he is extremely smart, calm and thoughtful but nevertheless a mean villain that plans and organizes everything at his advantage and that never stops to surprise. Those three memorable actors at the peak of their early careers have an amazing chemistry and I have never ever seen a movie with three outstanding actors. Normally, there are one or rarely two actors that give good movies a certain kind of soul and creativity, but this movie is graced by the works of three great actors. If that was not already enough, the supporting actors such as Aldo Giuffr\u00e8 as a drunk and desperate Union Captain that befriends with the characters of Wallach and Eastwood.One must also underline the story itself. It takes the time to slowly introduce each of the characters in their own special ways. The viewer gets the time to get used and connect with them before the main plot kicks off which is an unusual and great idea. The further development reveals more and more about the characters and their past. Lee van Cleef is shown as he fulfils his dirty works and contracts, Eli Wallach meets his brother, a catholic friar that confronts him with old family problems and Clint Eastwood remains the tough vagabond and mysterious man without a name. The story is filled with many memorable and diversified situations, connecting a the elements of a treasure chase with a tale of revenge and scenes of the American Civil War. The movie is not just a western, it's has some slight social touches that look behind the brutal characters and gore or desperate war or prison scenes. The movie has some touches of a drama, an anti war movie, a satire of the usual westerns and an epic adventure flick. There is much to discover and analyze beyond the main plot that is a breathtaking treasure chase filled with cliffhangers.Finally, this movie has also had an important influence on an entire genre. The Italian spaghetti western genre got finally accepted and boomed as well as the whole western genre. The movie made an incredible gross with a very low budget. Many critics regard this movie as a classic nowadays and even people which use to hate westerns happen to like this flick, especially women. That's why this movie is way more than just a western, it is an epic masterpiece for the ages and everybody that disagrees on that has a very subjective point of view because the artistic factor of this flick is very elevated and the acting memorable. Everybody that hasn't seen this movie yet should do this right now, it is one of those movies one should have seen at least once in a lifetime. Personally, I watch this flick at least once a year and I'm always looking forward to it and never get bored. I happen to invite friends that don't know this movie yet to open their minds and until now, I never got less than enthusiastic comments.I would say that this movie is probably my favourite one of all times until now and will surely stay in my eternal top five.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "An epic masterpiece for the ages", "date": "2011-04-05T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2409383", "sentiment score": [0.0081, 0.0132, 0.02, 0.2063, 0.7524]}, {"content": "One of the mysteries of modern life is how this motion picture currently comes to occupy its No 4 spot on the IMDb list of all-time greats. If not totally insane, the story is undeniably either ridiculous, ludicrous, hilarious or risible. Perhaps the word I'm looking for is laughable. I'm not saying it isn't entertaining. It is that also.It is an American Western partly written by an Italian director, Sergio Leone, who shot it in Spain. He invented a new cinematic genre, by linking the maniacal overstatement of Italian grand opera with the Spanish picaresque tradition, as he himself has indicated. Picaro is a Spanish word for \"rogue\" or \"rascal\", and the picaresque novel is usually satirical, depicting, \"in realistic and often humorous detail, the adventures of roguish heroes of low social class who live by their wits in a corrupt society.\" The viewer is asked to believe that two picaros, Clint and Eli, can make good money, if not a steady living, claiming bounty rewards for Eli's sins (which include playing cards with a marked deck), and then having Clint shoot through the rope which is hanging Eli, from some considerable distance. Eli then fortunately stays sitting on his conveniently placed horse which gallops away. Pull the other one; it's got bells on.For a detailed exposition of the plot, and the different putative locations, see the FAQ, which is required reading if some sense is to be made of the narrative, as filmed. This is of little help when actually watching, however.Two of the weirdest scenes occur at the very beginning, and at the very end. The opening starts with one of Leone's trademark facial closeups, of a peculiarly evil-looking individual. A little further on Eli bursts through a window. Difficult to tell why, since he leaves about three gunmen dead on the floor of the room which he has just left. He was apparently in the middle of gnawing his dinner.Some way into the movie we leave Spain, which has been doubling for Mexico, and enter what looks like the Sahara desert. I was expecting at least a camel, or possibly Omar Sharif, to materialize out of the sand. But no, instead we get a driverless coach and six, full of dead and dying soldiers, coming out of nowhere like a bat from hell --- had we wandered into Hammer Films territory? Skip to the end, where our two heroes, Clint and Eli, now find themselves in what has been called a Mexican standoff with evil-eyed Lee van Cleef. Difficult to know why he hadn't been shot a long time earlier, since he didn't appear to have any valuable information about where the buried treasure was, like the other two. Anyway, he sure gets shot now in an amazingly pointless and prolonged three-cornered duel, which takes place in a uniquely circular cemetery, specially designed for the standoff.Leone is fond of scenes where a man is shown to be terrified by suspension from a rope round his neck. This turns up four times in this movie, and once more in his far greater masterpiece, OUATITW. This film (GBU) is much inferior, but you can't say it isn't entertaining.

Another amazing movie from Sergio Leone. The Good, The Bad and the Ugly has so much good about it, and quintessentially it is one of the best westerns ever made.

Clint Eastwood gives one of his best performances ever here, and Eli Wallach is perfectly cast and more than a match for him.

The Good, The Bad and the Ugly is also the most violent of the trilogy, and one of the most violent of the genre, not a bad thing whatsoever.The pace was spot on too, even though the film is nearly three hours long, it is never boring or dull. The best things though about The Good, The Bad and the Ugly are the visuals and Ennio Morricone's score. The film looks amazing, the cinematography is gorgeous and the sweeping images and scenery are very lovingly crafted. Morricone's score is even more impressive than that, it is simply one of the best film scores I've ever heard, and if I had to say which was Morricone's best score, I would immediately say this.Overall, there is nothing bad or ugly about the film.

It already happened to me to see classical movies, live again the feelings I had at the previews viewing and discover new perspectives brought up by the years. With 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' something different seems to have happened. It's my third viewing if I remember well. I scarcely remember the first one, I was a teenage and I must have seen the movie at the same time I was seeing other classic westerns like these starring John Wayne. Then I saw it again in the 90s and what struck me was the fabulous acting especially Eli Wallach's. This latest experience is different as I dare now discharge all the labels and enjoy what is best in this film - the camera art, the dynamic of the characters, the superb acting of the three lead actors, Ennio Morricone's music which entered the best soundtracks gallery, the color and diversity of the extras and the fresh perspective brought to a moment of history often present in the American film. By the mid 60s when Sergio Lepne had the chutzpah of undertaking the trilogy project western was a genre in stagnation. The period of the big films of John Ford was passed over, actors like John Wayne or Richard Widmark were beyond their pick, and westerns were not considered a source of blockbusters by the big studios.It was kind of natural to expect renewal to come from out of America, as in Europe the Far West space was keeping its fascination and the potential of staging eternally human dramas. After the success of the first two films in the trilogy Leone wanted the third one to be a quality upgrade, more ambitious and more stylish. Although he could not hire the actors he wished, he was lucky to receive as replacement Eli Wallach who gives here one of the best performances of his career, a combination wicked shrewdness and surviving skills, a dangerous creep with a sense of humor. The viewing is a fest from start to end. That was the period of Technicolor and big screens, and Leone masters the technology and the format, which fit the endless desert where most of the action happens. While filmed in Spain, one can say that never had Andalucia looked so Texan. The local extras faces carved by wind and sun fit perfectly the cinematographic landscape. Morricone's music fills in the vision in a synthesis that was played and quoted in endless movies that followed (to mention 'Kill Bill''s theme as the last I remember). Especially visible and special is the reconstruction of the Civil War background. From 'Gone with the Wind' to 'Cold Mountain' this is one of the most filmed episodes of American history, allowing for numerous mass and battle scenes. Amazingly the vision of the Italian Leone fits perfectly in the gallery. Moreover the juxtaposition of the situations of fortune seekers and of the soldiers caught in the absurd of the was allows for a comparison with anti-militaristic nuances. Soldiers and adventurers play death games with little chances of survival. And yet, for at least one moment the the game of the fortune seekers seems more rational and even more human than the organized game of destruction called war.The actor that dominates the film is without any doubt Clint Eastwood. Closing up the trilogy that launched his career, 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' brings the last touches to the portrait of the Man with No Name from the previous movies, the soldier of fortune and killer who never draws first his gone and never kills without a reason. The script places him here in different situations than in the previous movies, but the scene of the duel in three close to the final brings him back the poncho as the sign that the cycle draws to its end. In the permanent game of trickery and death Blondie is the only of the three characters that allows to himself manifestations of humanity and acts of compassion that endanger him. Howevwe he knows and we know that he aims and shoots faster and better and he will eventually prevail.

For those of you not familiar with the storyline, it revolves around the attempts of three rouges to find a missing fortune in Confederate gold in New Mexico during the Civil War. The 2003 DVD has an excellent audio commentary by film critic Richard Schickel, who also collaborated with Eastwood on a definitive Eastwood biography. I gave this film a 10 out of 10 star ranking in IMDb. It scored 20 points in my ranking system, placing it in fourth place all time. Here's the Good: Eli Wallach and Leone created one of the great villains in the history of cinema. Tuco is equal parts amoral scourge, paisan sympatico and stand up comic. The only characters in the history of Westerns that compare are Little Bill in \"Unforgiven\", Judge Roy Bean in \"The Westerner\" and Joe Erin in \"Vera Cruz\". Gene Hackman and Walter Brennan both won Best Supporting Actor Oscars for those performances. If the Academy ever decides to start handing out retroactive awards, this would be a good place to start. The movie is notable for launching Clint Eastwood to life long international superstardom. Eastwood went on to direct and star in two Westerns that occupy the second and third places in my all time list, \"Unforgiven\" and \"The Outlaw Josie Wales.\" If not for the success of TGTBTU, those films might not exist. The best soundtrack in the history of Westerns.....the signature laughing hyena, the eerie whistling, the soaring mariachi trumpets, and most importantly, the twangy guitar solo and macho male chorus constantly driving the plot forward. Other than the theme from \"The Magnificent Seven\", this is only Western soundtrack to become a part of the general popular culture. Hugo Montenegro's cover version reached number two on the Billboard charts in 1968. I call Leone's counterpoint between the long, flowing episodes of deep sentimentality and short bursts of graphic violence \"John Ford on steroids\". Coppola would copy this technique several years later in an even more gruesome scene in \"The Godfather\". Fantastic 10 minute opening sequence with no dialog, a homage to \"Rio Bravo\" and \"Comanche Station\". This is bookended at the film's climax by another spellbinding five minutes with no dialog. I admire Leone's bold decision not to sandwich in a gratuitous female romantic interest. Last \"all guy\" Western until \"Brokeback Mountain\" (just kidding). This may be the first \"Vietnam\" Western. This is impressive, since in 1965 when the story was conceived and written, opposition to the war was not yet fashionable. This was a watershed film for Westerns in terms of realism. It wasn't the first one to completely break with production code restraints, but it was the first popular and successful Western to do so. There would be no going back to the world where justice always prevails in the end, everyone's wardrobe is perfectly pressed, bullet wounds are bloodless and there are no gratuitous graphic rapes. Brilliant casting of Lee Van Cleef, a minor actor in many Westerns from the golden age of the '50's, including \"High Noon\", \"The Bravados\", \"The Gunfight at the O.K. Corral\" and \"Ride Lonesome\". His presence is one of many Leone homages in the movie to classic Westerns (including a number of references to 1948's \"Yellow Sky\"). The presentation of Van Cleef's facial features as sculpture reminds me of Boetticher's use of Randolph Scott in the Ranown cycle of films. The best use of the Civil War ever in a Western. The only competitors I'm aware of are \"Dances With Wolves\", \"Major Dundee\" and \"Escape From Fort Bravo\". It's impressive that the portrayal of the Civil War battle is realistically based on the Battle of Glorieta Pass, which took place in New Mexico in 1862. It is often falsely thought that this movie is set in Texas, where there were no major Civil War battles. This misinformation, spread by Leone himself apparently, has deceived some critics into thinking the basic setting of the movie is implausible. Finally, of the five Leone Westerns, this is the perfect blend of Leone's distinctive style with a clever, fast moving and entertaining plot. The other four movies are all fine films, but the first two \"Dollar\" movies were very low budget and Leone's style was still evolving. Meanwhile, in \"Duck, You Sucker\" and \"Once Upon A Time in the West\", Leone disconnected himself from the needs of his commercial audience. Leone was quoted by his biographer, Richard Frayling, as saying that he made OUTITW \"for cineastes only\". TGTBTU is satisfying for both scholars and popular audiences. The Bad and the Ugly: I don't have much negative to say about this film. I've read critics who feel it is too long, that the story's not interesting enough, that the Tuco character is irritating. that Wallach's acting is hammy and that the premise of three criminals riding around loose during the Civil War is implausible. I don't think any of these arguments hold water. When it was released in the U.S. in 1968, it was roundly panned for its excessive violence.

You dig.\u00a8 I wonder what would've been of Clint Eastwood's career if it weren't for the \u00a8Dollars\u00a8 trilogy. Before working with Italian filmmaker, Sergio Leone, he had a career as a television actor in Rawhide, a western based TV series, but he couldn't get a decent job in Hollywood so he began to look for work abroad. He reached international success thanks to Leone's reinvented spaghetti westerns: A Fistful of Dollars (1964), For a Few Dollars More (1965), and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly (1966), known as the \u00a8Dollars\u00a8 trilogy. He proved producers wrong because they thought that people wouldn't pay to see movies of actors they could see for free on television, but audiences were more than willing to see him in the big screen. His pairing with Leone couldn't have worked out better for him since the director's trademark was combining long wide shots with extreme close-ups. These wide shots couldn't have been enjoyed as much on the small television sets at home. Eastwood's rough features and manly charisma also contributed to Leone's success, and both seemed destined to work with each other. There is no need to see the previous \u00a8Dollars\u00a8 movies as The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly stands out on its own and is actually a prequel since the movie takes place during the Civil War in the early 1860's before the other plots take place and they are all separate stories that only have Clint Eastwood's character in common. When I see Eastwood's latest films as a director I can't help but think how much he was influenced by the great Sergio Leone. He must have learned a great deal working with the Italian director in this masterpiece. It is just shot beautifully and to perfection by Leone, the cinematography and scenery are amazing and feel real, and the score is perfect. Eastwood may be a different director than Leone was, but he pays close detail to his craft and also knows how to shoot beautifully.The plot is pretty simple for a movie that is about three hours long, but Leone's use of the camera and extended shots makes the film longer. He also adds several side stories that work really well in the narrative. The film begins by introducing each character (although in the opposite order: The Ugly, The Bad, and The Good). The film begins with an extreme close up on a bounty hunter (Al Mulock) and then when we see the wide shot there are three of them who are quietly entering a bar. Once the men enter we hear three shots and out comes Tuco, also known as The Ugly (Eli Wallach), who escapes. In the next scene we are introduced to The Bad, Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), who is tracking down a peasant farmer. The scene is truly a classic as no words are spoken for about ten minutes, but the tension can be felt. Angel Eyes is actually looking for information on the location of a treasure of coins lost during the Civil War and he is told a soldier named Bill Carson has it. Finally, we are introduced to Blondie, The Good (Clint Eastwood), who saves Tuco from a group of men who want to turn him in because there is a reward on his head. Blondie saves him only to collect the reward himself, but once Tuco is about to be hanged he shoots the rope and sets him free as part of a scam in which they divide the money. They later turn against each other only to discover the location of the treasure that has been buried and the race begins to see who can get to the treasure first as the three men have different information regarding its whereabouts.The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is my all-time favorite Western. Any other film in the genre will always be measured by its standards. The opening scene in which we are introduced to Angel Eyes (The Bad) is just so beautifully shot that no dialogue was needed and we were already hooked (Ennio Morricone's amazing score can also take some credit for that). The first ten minutes have no dialogue whatsoever but it sets up the general tone of the movie: several wide shots where we can see the great landscape and deserts combining them with extreme close ups of the characters facial expressions, the tension and suspense is built with long and slow scenes and suddenly the violence happens so quickly that we are caught off guard. The film doesn't celebrate violence, it portrays it truthfully. The main character is the quiet Blondie (The Good), but without a doubt Tuco (The Ugly) is the one who has the most lines and brings some unbalance and goofiness to an otherwise serious picture. One of the funniest scenes is when he is in the tub and one of the bounty hunter shows up to kill him but before shooting he begins the classic speech villains tend to give and Tuco pulls out his gun and fires at him saying, \u00a8When you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk.\u00a8 Tuco plays a key role and his character is kind of the gray in an otherwise black (Angel Eyes) and white (Blondie), good guy and bad guy western movie. He breaks the conventionality in the genre. The final Mexican standoff scene is also truly memorable and one of the best shot sequences. This is a truly unique film that has stood the test of time; it catapulted Eastwood into a movie star, and has influenced him on his way to becoming a great director. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly is one of my all time favorite movies and is a must see film.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 4}, "heading": "A Western Masterpiece!", "date": "2010-09-17T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2312001", "sentiment score": [0.0275, 0.0882, 0.1623, 0.4584, 0.2636]}, {"content": "\"Nostalgia is a product of dissatisfaction and rage. It is a settling of grievances between the present and the past. The more powerful the nostalgia, the closer you come to violence. War is the form nostalgia takes when men are hard-pressed to say something good about their country.\" \u2013 Don DeLillo \"God's not on our side because he hates idiots also.\" - BlondieItalian iconography meets Akira Kurosawa meets Hollywood Westerns, Sergio Leone's \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\" marks the point at which cinema took its first big steps (if we ignore the works of Godard) into the arena of postmodernity. From here would spawn the likes of George Lucas's \"Star Wars\" and later Tarantino's \"Kill Bill\", each generation of Leone devotees increasingly flat and weightless.Leone's own work would become increasingly suffused with postmodernism's undertow of nostalgia and regret, films like \"West\" and \"America\" less about plot than they are a film nerd's feverish dreams, all the tropes of the gangster and the western genre fetishized and mourned, a series of melancholic referrals to Ford, Hawks, Boetticher, Anthony Mann, Raoul Walsh, George Stevens and the hard boiled literature of Chandler and Hammett (the first two \"dollars\" movies are essentially film noirs with horses). These films aren't about the passage of time, but the passage of cinema, a child's attempt to hold on to the images of his past. No surprise that Leone's cites John Ford's \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valence\" as his favourite Western, as it's Ford's most melancholic and nostalgic film.Leone's films are thus primarily concerned about living with the image of \"America\", and never \"being\" American. His films revolve around a vision of America as an all pervading presence always seen from a distance, through the image. In this regard, many of his films rely on flashbacks and memory. Think the nostalgia, longing and melancholy of Colonel Mortimer in \"For a Few Dollars More\", of Harmonica and Cheyenne in \"West\", and the protagonists of \"Dynamite\" and \"America\", all of whom reflect Leone's own nostalgic feelings towards an America which he imagined, discovered, idealised, desired and naively longed for as a child (and latter as an artist). Paradoxically, however, Leone's nostalgia doesn't owe itself to distance from or homesickness for real things and places; his is a purely artistic, and so dangerous, nostalgia. What he misses are signifiers, artistic representations, and so the constant in Leone's films is therefore not subversion (that's Altman), like many claim, but rather infatuation; in the end, myths remains myths and at most they can be restated and updated, but not overturned.French philosopher Jean Baudrillard dubbed \"The Good the Bad and The Ugly\" the moment when modernism died and cinema began its crawl toward postmodernism. Baudrillard uses this term in a negative sense, speaking of a cultural obsession with \"lost objects\", referrals and went on to predict art's progression toward a kind of \"weightlessness\" (eg \"Kill Bill\") or reliance on resurrection and pastiche. While this is true for Leone's later films, \"TGTBATU\" belongs more to that sweet spot in world cinema (the late 60s and early 70s) in which iconoclasts like Antonioni, Altman, Peckinpah, Kubrick, Godard etc were thriving.And so while \"TGTBATU\" pulls from everywhere, both stylistically (the opening credits are modelled on the James Bond franchise, a series which Leone loved) and logistically (the film had financial backers in Germany, Spain and America, the cast were from all over the world and all spoke different languages etc), it's far more than a celluloid mash-up. It retains a certain weight typical of the 60s, more akin to the violent works of Siegel and Arthur Penn or the revisionist westerns of Altman, Peckinpah and late career Huston and Ford. Of course during this period you also had other extremely important but less known directors like Monte Hellman, Sydney Pollack, Robert Benton, Abraham Polonsky, George Hill, William Wiard, Elliot Silverstein and Ralph Nelson all making different kinds of interesting westerns (\"Tom Horn\", \"A Man Called Horse\", \"Soldier Blue\" etc).The point is, Leone didn't \"shatter the myth\" of the Old West. Everyone during this period was doing that. Everyone was working against traditional concepts of heroism and justice. No, what Leone did was re-mythologise the West using the iconoclastic techniques of 60s and 70s cinema. He dirtied things up and then put these larger than life men back up on pedestals.Of course what \"TGTBATU\" is really known for is its wonderful \"comic book\" style. Bob Dylan crossed from folk to electric in 1965, and here was Leone making the same transition, serving up a rock and roll Western with electric guitars. And so we have masterful widescreen Techniscope compositions, powerful juxtapositions between wide shots and extreme close ups, Ennio Morricone's innovative score, a cast of slimy, dirty heroes (the film's sloppy sound dubbing works in its grimy favour) and a tale that is flippant, ironic and playfully told.Though thin like a comicbook, the film also has a very primordial undertow, a certain weight, with its dreamlike terrain of bombed out ghost towns and a soundtrack which mimics rattlesnakes, coyotes and horses. Its plot may simply consists of sweaty scroungers navigating a landscape perpetually covered in war, death and suffering, but there's nevertheless something very \"human\", existential even, about the film. Leone distills human nature down to simple elements and then injects a tone of regret such that the film seems to mourn the very \"archetypal humanity\" it revels in. Seems to mourn the very greed, violence and death that orbits around and within its small cast of characters. According to Leone, there's a little bit of good, bad and ugliness in everybody.

The style of the action is perfectly done and like stated it is quite violent maybe more than one might suspect if you don't know anything about the movie. The characters are superb, Clint Eastwood is of course the best and the coolest. The bad is a really brilliant villain and the ugly is great comic relief. Even though this might seem like a light weight no depth movie with stereotype characters, it's not because they are so well done and brilliantly acted that the viewer gets a stronger feeling for them than any other film like this. Sure the story is not that deep but it's neither predictable, just perfectly balanced. Then the music, must be among the best ever for a Western film, especially at the ending such a feeling it gives.

Not only is it my all-time favorite Western and therefore, one of my all-time favorite movies regardless of genre, but is a landmark in the history of cinema itself. First of all, it is proof that oftentimes the simplest ideas are the best ones. The plot is fairly simple: three men try to reach a buried fortune of Army gold coins while the Civil War erupts around them. The story is even simpler and yet the audience gets wrapped around in it as 160 minutes and those 160 minutes just seem to whip by so fast that when the movie does end, we're craving for more. The film is also evidence that the Western is not a dying genre, for this landmark film from Italian director Sergio Leone has aged like wine; time has done nothing to varnish its style and authority. And it is also proof that Spaghetti Westerns, which are low in budget and oftentimes flamboyant and over-the-top, can be art, too.This was the third and final time that Clint Eastwood worked with Sergio Leone. He returns again as the mysterious Man with No Name: a cigar-chugging bounty hunter quick on the draw and minimal in emotions. Here is the pinnacle of the vintage Eastwood as an actor, where he could manufacture a character by doing little other than squinting and hissing some sparse dialogue. Eastwood's in prime form here. The movie also features Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes, a mercenary/bounty hunter/Army colonel, the exact opposite of the warm-hearted character he played in the previous Western \"For a Few Dollars More.\" But oddly enough, even though Eastwood gets top billing, the central character is Tuco, played with outstanding charisma and sharp energy by Eli Wallach. Wallach had played bad guys and anti-heroes before, but here as the bumbling, deliberately comical, greedy, self-centered, and yet somehow likable and personable Tuco, he steals the show. The movie stays interesting as these three men change partnerships with each other, whenever it seems convenient and when it'll bring them closer to the 200,000 dollars in stolen coins. These three characters, wonderfully written and acted, are an important column holding this film's roof up.Sergio Leone was very much the David Lean of Italy. He could set up beautiful landscape shots and cinematography tricks like few others could. That's part of the reason why so little can happen for so long and yet the tension mounts higher than most. The way he also contrasts long shots with close-ups and montages it all is sheer brilliance. His timing is also exquisite. He knows how long to go, when to cut, when to produce a long take, when to crop a short one, and so on and so forth.And I cannot leave out Ennio Morricone's music, which is even more famous than the movie itself. His main theme, which has been used in parodies and cultural references for more than forty years, is justifiably famous. But whereas it is usually used in parodies to produce a comical effect, here it fits the mood of the picture down to the bone. There's not a single weak cue of music in this marvelous soundtrack.But what's most remarkable about this movie is that it sustains itself for the entirety of its 160-minute length and throughout most of it, very little happens. There are long stretches - minutes upon minutes - where virtually nothing happens. Oftentimes there isn't any music. It's not just the suspense of waiting for Leone's trademark bursts of action; the cinematography and the montage and the directing are so taut and winded together that the audience cannot even force themselves to look away. And if one seeks proof, they have to look no further than the film's climax. Of course because it's a Western, it will have an obligatory final showdown. But consider this showdown. We have three men facing each other down and it goes on for four minutes. Four minutes and the actors are hardly even moving. The only real movement is the camera, which is locked-down, but montaging amongst what is very nearly static images. Coupled with Ennio Morricone's heart-thumping music, this showdown, where very little happens for so long, comes across as one of the most electrifying climaxes in cinema history. Sure the music helps a lot, but it's the directing by Sergio Leone that really makes this scene so intense.\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" is most definitely one of the most important films of all time and it certainly has earned its immortality in the realm of the cinema. It is undoubtedly the greatest Spaghetti Western of them all and Sergio Leone's masterpiece. The first film is this trilogy, \"A Fistful of Dollars\" was nothing more than an off-beat, but fun remake of \"Yojimbo.\" The second film was also entertaining and fun. But the third movie is a masterpiece. Even at a great length of 160 minutes, and having most of it consumed by silence and stillness, the film never falters to goes on for too long. It goes on and when it does at last end, the audience is left craving for more. They can satisfy themselves in two ways: a) seeking out Leone's director's cut, which is about twenty minutes longer and b) watching the movie again, something I have done and will continue to do many, many times.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 4, "votes": 5}, "heading": "Never before has two hours and forty minutes whipped by so fast", "date": "2010-08-26T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2301318", "sentiment score": [0.0087, 0.0264, 0.0666, 0.4003, 0.4979]}, {"content": "Italian-born film director Sergio Leone completed his western trilogy with Clint Eastwood in what constituted a prequel to the \"Dollars\" movies. \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" qualifies as a sprawling tale of greed about three men and their tenacious search for a Confederate strong box containing $200-thousand dollars in gold coins. This memorable United Artists continued a trend in Leone's filmmaking. He kept making films that were bigger and bigger. Eventually, he would make an even bigger western than \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" entitled \"Once Upon a Time in the West.\" Previously, Leone's first oater \"Fistful of Dollars\" had been produced on a shoestring budget and shared sets with another Continental western lensed in Spain. When Leone produced \"For Few Dollars More,\" he imported a second American actor, veteran heavy Lee Van Cleef, and commissioned art director Carlo Simi to construct an entire western town in Almeria, Spain. Reportedly, the El Paso town set cost more than the budget for \"Fistful of Dollars.\" Meanwhile, Van Cleef reunited with Leone and Eastwood for \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,\" and Leone imported yet another American actor. Eli Wallach, who had played the bandit chieftain in John Sturges' classic \"The Magnificent Seven,\" signed on as the third American actor. Essentially, Leone cast Eastwood again as a bounty hunter designated as \"The Good\" and called him 'Blondie,\" while Van Cleef played \"the Bad,\" and Wallach appeared as \"the Ugly.\" \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" became Leone's most expensive western to date and he set the action against the American Civil War. Naturally, all three eponymous characters are a little larger than life themselves. The relationship between the Eastwood as well as the Van Cleef character changed drastically because Van Cleef was not playing Colonel Douglas Mortimer. Ironically, Van Cleef's character was named 'Angel Eyes,' and he made his living as a man who hunts down other men and kills them for a price. No, \"the Bad\" isn't a bounty hunter. Meantime, \"the Good\" brings in a slimy, profane Mexican bandit named Tuco. He collects the reward on Tuco's head, and later shoots the noose from around Tuco's neck, so the slippery Mexican can escape. Later, Blondie and Tuco split the money. This relationship comes to an end because Blondie doesn't think that Tuco will be worth more than $3-thousand. Clocking in at 180 minutes, \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" bristles with shoot-outs. Live is cheap in the world of the Italian western and the horses outnumber the corpses. Money means everything. The three protagonists refuse to let a national catastrophe like the Civil War interfere with their plans to find the cashbox. Eventually, they do and confront each other in a massive graveyard to shoot it out. Anybody who considers himself or herself a connoisseur of Spaghetti westerns must watch \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.\" This savage western made quite an impression on audiences when it was released and Grammy Award-winning composer Ennio Morricone's orchestral soundtrack emerged as a hit on American music charts.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 5}, "heading": "Leone's Civil War Epic with Clint Eastwood", "date": "2010-08-24T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2300649", "sentiment score": [0.0292, 0.0993, 0.1914, 0.4927, 0.1874]}, {"content": "The movie was a classic.

There are many movies which are considered among the best ever by the majority of people that are as overrated as this one is. However, that this is one of the most overrated of all time, no one can deny that.I hate westerns. However, considering the fame of this one, the fact that it is in most lists of the all time's greatest movies, the fact of being a Spanish-Italian production and the value that most people give it (including this guy who is a friend of mine, who owns the movie and loaned it to me), I decided to give it a look, even though its long runtime could easily scare me off.I know that its Italian title is 'Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo', but I don't know if it was filmed in English language and later dubbed in Italian or the contrary, although I believe it was filmed in English.This spaghetti western was directed by Sergio Leone and stars Clint Eastwood as Blondie (\"The Good\"), Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes (\"The Bad\") and Eli Wallach as Tuco (\"The Ugly\").To be frank, the character Tuco annoyed me very much, not to mention that he was worst than snakes. Angel Eyes was nowhere near as annoying, being a more likable character in comparison. Blondie is a more complicated character. He's supposed to be the good guy yet he teams with Tuco during most of the movie and actually saves him twice from his execution rope (including in the end, when he was supposed to kill him). He kills Angel Eyes, yet he doesn't kill Tuco - and after everything that Tuco did to him. He is not that good after all...There's some good in this movie but I saw far more of bad and ugly in it. There is brutal violence in this. Plus, the movie is way too long. And it doesn't really offer much during its runtime of nearly 3 hours.Certain sequences were filmed in a way that strongly resembles me '2001: A Space Odyssey'. The first 9-10 minutes are a good example of this. The opening is long and has music, there is no dialog, the slow pace of the scenes gives us time to appreciate the scenario. Another good example of this is the Mexican standoff scene that lasts 5 minutes near the ending when the 3 main characters stare each other down in the graveyard's circular center, calculating alliances and dangers (and the amazing distance which the camera films it).The famous film score by Ennio Morricone (who is a genius, like John Williams) is phenomenal, especially the spectacular and unforgettable main theme. But the music that plays when Tuco is running in the Sad Hill cemetery is equally memorable.I didn't know that this movie was part of a trilogy, much less that it was the 3rd one.

Three lawless gunslingers are after it.

The haunting whistles of the first moments of the title sequence are instantly recognisable even to those who have never seen a Western. Clint Eastwood is instantly recognisable in a career-making role. No matter your verdict, this is an immensely important film.Director Sergio Leone has a sense for painful irony. 'The Good', Eastwood's character, begins the film by double crossing his partner (Eli Wallach's conflicted Tuco, 'The Ugly') and leaving him in the desert. This irony goes to the level of sight and sound. As 'The Bad' (Lee Van Cleef's Angel Eyes) tortures his victims at a Civil War P.O.W. camp, he orders the other prisoners to play their instruments to drown out the screams. The expressions on the faces of the musicians speaks volumes, and is more affecting to a modern audience than the scenes of torture themselves, gorged as we are on Saw and Hostel. It is this attention to storytelling detail in every frame of the film that makes it so rich and deep. How film-making has changed.While the film is long and slow, it has to be. The tension built up in the early parts of the film is punctuated by brief flashes of action, but it is the waiting before the action sequences that grabs you by the insides and slowly squeezes. There are ideas and emotions being played with in this film that cannot be quickly explained or unravelled, and these need the full three hours of the film to come to their conclusion. With the luxury of time, Leone is able to make a shared meal as tense and troubling as the moment, hands on guns, before a shootout.Even if you think the middle sections of the film dragged somewhat (philistine!) the finale is something special. In so many ways, it is the perfect climax to a film filled with moments of brilliance. There are too many parts to the film, too many special moments, to comment on any more, so I will simply say that this is a film I should have seen long before I did finally watch it. It is a film that, if you haven't seen, you should as soon as possible. And if you have seen it, a second, third or fifty-seventh viewing is in order.

Lee Van Cleef hovers around the the center of the film menacing everyone, although his performance fades between the tension of Wallach and Eastwood. Ostensibly a story about the search for buried gold, GBU undercuts its exploitative surface by giving us almost Beckett-like relationship between a man that is wanted for murder and his partner who turns him in for the reward and then shoots the rope off his neck, a droll comment on human existence if there ever was one. Other existential moments occur in this rich film, such as the beautiful song the confederate prisoners sing while Angel-Eyes tortures Tuco, and the essay on the nature of the futility and pointless brutality of war appears when Tuco and Blondie witness a battle on a bridge they must cross.Chaotic, cynical, sentimental, violent, GBU resembles an opera more than anything.

Well, not so fast. Are we really okay with brutal (if brief) mistreatment of women, fast and senseless bloodshed, and lots of bad overdubbing of dialog?Maybe.Yes, this is a cinematic movie, and if you can overlook its flaws (some) you will be wowed and dazzled by its merits (very many).Overflowing with archetypes, filmed with huge widescreen effect, brimming with familiar scenes vividly re-imagined, this is a movie that is dramatic (or ironic) in softspoken (or cynical) ways. There are gunslinging shootouts, long lonesome treks across the desert, and showdowns between tough guys. Yup. And it's all built around a story that leads scene after scene to one big moment after another. There's no question this is a movie that is great fun to watch. In fact, for its visuals, the sheer cinematography and sets and editing, this is as good as it gets, amazing stuff. The man behind that was Tonino Delli Colli, the cinematographer for some other of director Sergio Leone's legendary movies beyond this one: Once Upon a Time in the West, and Once Upon a Time in America (and well as the astonishing Life is Beautiful.) But overall, for its content, its plot, its message (if that matters), is TGTBTU a great film, a masterpiece?Well, the movie is smart. It deliberately plays off of its genre, which had worn itself thin by the 1960s, so things push over the top in a campy, awesome, excessive way. It almost feels obliged to revisit and exaggerate all the themes of American Westerns, including the Civil War, including slapping women around and killing people in a flurry of fast six-shooter magic. Even the title makes clear this is about a stripped down, pumped up version of older classics. Whatever his aura over time, Clint Eastwood is no great actor, not in my book, and here he is easily out shined by Eli Wallach, who plays a less attractive type, and by Lee Van Cleef, who plays a more attractive one. But Eastwood isn't meant to be acting, not exactly. He has aura. He's stoic and inscrutable, exaggerated make-up and all, and he shoots a mean Colt, or Smith and Wesson, something classy and throbbing. He's a great archetype, in a movie that is about archetypes. It's not a \"realistic\" movie, of course, not at all, and it's actually a comedy at times, overall, and it's totally fun and never laughable.Go ahead, compare it to The Wild Bunch, and then to Butch Cassidy, both coming just after this one (and no doubt influenced by it). Both of these later movies have more impressive acting, and more intense intentions (both in brutal violence and in cinematic innovation). But all three have a similar effect, playing within a genre that has always, since the 1939 Stagecoach, been beautifully trapped by its limitations (that's part of its staying power for fans). The Searchers (1956) and High Noon (1952), for starters, are working within the genre, and gnawing at it, as if its something to feed off of. That's where The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly really shines. I have trouble with aspects of it, but I really like it in a bigger sense, looking the other way as needed. I switch to first person because I think it's a personal preference, and a lot of guys I know love the movie to pieces, and a couple women I know think it's either stupid or insulting or boring (actually boring!). It's an Italian production, which explains some of the out of sync dubbing. Sergio Leone obviously has an intuitive sense of what makes a movie moving, something sorely missed in a lot of productions since. It's gritty, dirty, and it pounds \"profound\" hard in a male kind of \"toughness prevails\" way. Sorry guys, but bite that bullet. Oh, and the soundtrack? Amazing, perfect, and rising above the movie, which is great in its own way, I admit.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 5, "votes": 8}, "heading": "More good and beautiful than bad and ugly...but some of all four!", "date": "2010-05-21T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2253004", "sentiment score": [0.0224, 0.2052, 0.5496, 0.206, 0.0168]}, {"content": "Sergio Leone's 1966 Western The Good, the Bad and the Ugly unfolds under this hostile, violent and hate filled umbrella of Civil War America; a fitting backdrop of ongoing warfare and hostilities to which two American men and a Mexican bandit strive to find a large box full of valuable coins buried out in the big country somewhere behind Confederate Army lines. In using a plot item as routine as said example and applying it to a relatively routine singular strand arc for the film's narrative to take, Leone essentially breathes so much life into a set up and plot plan that about half way through you forget the basic bare bones of the movie and find yourself going with it, utterly immersed in the tale the director's laying out in front of you. So much has been written and said about the film, like other such examples at the top of each genre, that further comment and analysis may seem futile. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly may very well be the pinnacle to the western as Psycho might be to horror or Apocalypse Now to the war, for instance. If it isn't, or either of the said examples aren't, then there will still be a large cluster of individuals that would sternly argue otherwise.The film begins with a loud and confrontational title sequence, a brash and expansive manner in which to announce your film has arrived; the sort that sees a flashing of character faces and arrays of different colour, a sequence in which even the little animated horse gets the full force of a cannonball that's been fired off. It sets the tone for a no holds barred ride of guns; gunslingers and no nonsense people with no nonsense attitudes as observations of greed and that of both a mid and post-war crumbling society plays out. The film features some of the best direction I've ever seen; Leone's ability to shift gears and change the film's tact from one thing to another, as loyalties shift and events take a turn for the different is near-flawless. His ability to essentially construct a number of small, minute set-pieces amidst this wide-open and dusty, hostile setting is immaculate; but the change of tact he applies later on towards the end of the film in capturing a Civil War battle between the North and South is just as impressive; portraying a larger fight sequence as the inevitable showdown between the film's three main players draws nearer and that sense their showdown will be of a similarly epic proportion, despite it being just another gunfight and despite the fact all of those thus far have been between grossly outmatched participants.Leone is all for spectacle and action to propel the plot, but his ability to capture the little things; the terrain and just the sounds that it omits is wonderful. The introduction of Angel Eyes, aka The Bad (van Cleef), for instance sees a young boy flee into his house on first sight of him as he arrives; Angel Eyes' boots stomping on a stone floor whilst he approaches an elderly man sitting at a table as a dog barks outside, all of it a routine use of composition and SFX, but the drawn out editing process; the fact a kid ran for his life at first sight of him and the semiotical driven noise of a barking dog which suggests a rabid animal or ominousness build the scene and character without anyone ever explaining or saying anything.They call him The Bad because he shoots without mercy and takes without conscience, leaving a family in tatters and on another occasion beats a girl to a near pulp until she gives him what info he's looking for. The name Angel Eyes is wholly ironic. This makes Clint Eastwood's 'Good' (aka Blondie) and Wallach's 'Ugly' (aka Tuco) perhaps look more favourable than they actually are when it's revealed they're mostly in it together against this blackly dressed; father/husband murdering; woman slapping figure of evil. Tuco and Blondie's relationship is a strange one, a mutual appreciation of one another and the death they leave in their wake. Tuco would no sooner shoot Blondie, than hang him, than act like they're best friends. No longer is 'The Good' of a western limited to wearing the sheriff's badge and/or cleaning up towns of drunks and no-good varmints; as here, 'The Good' would much rather come across as upstanding; fleece a local sheriff of $2,000 and then make off with the cash against the guy he was initially in tow with.Tuco's raging attitudes are captured in a single shot that encompasses a sketching of Christ on the cross as he swigs alcohol whilst wearing an eye-patch, the film at a point where Tuco seems to be doing good in aiding an old friend but perhaps with a traitorous eye still on the prize as the patch acts as a visual distinction of the two sides of his face doubling up as his sinful and righteous attitudes, whereas he gives the Holy Trinity throughout. But THE scene that encapsulates his character is in a store early on during which, betrayed and foaming at the mouth for revenge, he fondles some handguns in front of an elderly clerk before angrily discarding them. He then fondles some more and asks for bullets, drawing you into the scene in an utterly effective manner and its threat element within as we wonder what he has in store for the clerk above all else. There's a solid hour of character involvement and some set-piece exchanges which work wonderfully well; and a later juxtaposition between diegetic musical content with an interrogation brought a smirk to my face when I realised whom it was that felt so inspired to pay homage to such a sequence.

I know this film is highly rated and people love it. And yeah, I found it enjoyable. I like a good shooter film with Clint Eastwood.

I liked the drunk military man, but it wasn't realistic.The dubbing was annoying. Clint Eastwood speaks English and he speaks to a variety of characters who are speaking Italian. Okay, one or the other. Hire actors who speak English or get Italians and subtitle the film. It's awkward to have Eastwood talking to people who, on the set, who probably didn't understand.Lastly, I need more Lee VanCleef. If he's \"the bad\", he should have a bigger role. Instead you have mostly Eastwood, who is \"the good\", being just as bad as the villain. I respect the idea that good and evil are not clear-cut, but why do I side with Eastwood if he's no more good than VanCleef? That being said, the film had a lot going for it. Very fun shooter, great bridge explosion scene (possibly better than \"River Kwai\") and the very memorable theme song. As far as Westerns go, I don't know that it was really much more advanced than \"Stagecoach\". Maybe more epic and longer, and Eastood can out-act John Wayne any day, but there wasn't much new here.I recommend this and feel I need to see it again, but perhaps see \"For a Few Dollars More\" first... that will give you some VanCleef action and Klaus Kinski.", "rating": 6, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 12, "votes": 36}, "heading": "A Good Movie, But Had Some Annoying Flaws", "date": "2010-04-09T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2233616", "sentiment score": [0.0236, 0.2661, 0.5422, 0.1616, 0.0064]}, {"content": "As I was scrolling through IMDb 250, I saw \"Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo\" at #4.

One of the key parts of what made the film entertaining was the score. 99 times out of 100 it fitted the scene in question perfectly, and added to the feeling of the moment perfectly. The camera work was actually surprisingly good too, the use of cameras created tension and build up with out the use of massivley expensive special effects. The one particular scene which I feel sums up the film is the amazing showdown scene in the cemetry. The use of music, cameras and the brilliant acting of our three leads.

One of which is the lack of details or explanation to a lot of situations which occour. Like one minute the leads are in one place, and the scene changes and they are in a completely different situation several months later with no intervening details. The Ugly; Again there is little which is awful about the film. I would moan about the length, but I feel this is a touch hypocritical, considering I have moaned about lack of details.

This was my second viewing \u2013 the first being in 2006, when my interest in cinema was still in its infancy \u2013 and, just as Leone's film gained status only in subsequent decades, my admiration has since grown substantially. By the early 1960s, the Western had become a tired genre, and even the best American entries {such as Ford's 'The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance (1962)'} could more closely be described as somber rather than thrilling. Leone's low-budget Italian productions breathed new life into the Western, the director's highly-stylised (and purely cinematic) film-making style tackling the recently-emerged Revisionist Western sub-genre with a cheekily-parodic sense of humour.Though 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly' clearly identifies each of its three protagonists with a titular adjective, the separating lines are decidedly blurred. Blondie (Clint Eastwood) is the archetypal anti-hero, a laconic, cigar-smoking bounty-hunter who makes every word, and every bullet, count. Tuco (Eli Wallach) is a slimy opportunist, a bottom-dweller whose unabashed enthusiasm \u2013 especially opposite the apathetic Eastwood \u2013 makes him an oddly-likable character. Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) is a crafty, intelligent schemer, greed and contempt mixing behind those cold, steely eyes. Leon's film revolves almost exclusively around these three characters, and the American Civil War is utilised purely as a historical backdrop. As was the director's style, the film is a triumph of contrasts: an epic period of American history is used merely as a stage for an intimate battle-of-wills between three determined men with their own selfish aims.Contrast, too, is evident through Leone's camera lens. Few directors (perhaps David Lean or Sergei Bondarchuk are his only true rivals in this field) have more inspiringly utilised the cinema screen as a canvas. Leone switches between landscapes and portraits, at times cutting unexpectedly from a distant long-shot to an extreme close-up of Eastwood's sweaty brow, his eyes narrowed and alert. I wrote in my review for 'A Fistful of Dollars (1964)' that that Leone's landscape was the human face. Unlike Ford, to whom setting was significant (one reason why he so adored Monument Valley), Leone's Westerns unfold in an anonymous landscape, dry and unremarkable and unforgiving. Colour is instead injected through Ennio Morricone's score, perhaps the most memorable ever composed for a film. The composer's contribution is uniquely cinematic, refusing to linger in the background and instead serving to overwhelm and enhance Leone's imagery.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 4}, "heading": "\"You may run the risks, my friend, but I do the cutting\"", "date": "2010-03-02T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2215438", "sentiment score": [0.0343, 0.2123, 0.2799, 0.3757, 0.0979]}, {"content": "I avoided seeing this film for many years.

Wallach's and Eastwood's stories are intertwined, and they eventually meet up with Van Cleef, although he disappears for long stretches of the film. The saga is long and drawn out and the characters are put through a lot in their quest for riches.But I'm not sure that's what the movie's about. It seems to preach the gruesomeness and pointlessness of war, showing wounded soldiers, some who've lost their legs or arms on the battlefield. The three main characters are just passing through. They have no allegiance and their outsider's point of view helps emphasize the absurdity of all that meaningless killing. I wonder if the gunmen's quest is merely the framework for an anti-war movie...Still, there's plenty of gunslinging action, as well as cannonfire and explosions. This Italian-made western is a pretty big production. The biggest of Sergio Leone's spaghetti westerns, yet, following the low-budget \"Fistful of Dollars\" and \"For A Few Dollars More\".If Eastwood's \"man with no name\" in Leone's \"Dollar Trilogy\" is meant to be a single character, this film (the final of the three) shows the birth of that man. This is where he acquires his iconic poncho.As far as westerns go, this isn't the usual John Wayne cowboy fare. If you've seen Leone's earlier westerns, you have an idea of what to expect, except this movie is different even from them. It's not about saloons or cattle trails, cowboys or Indians. It's not even about a ruthless villain that must be stopped. It's about three men all looking out for themselves and all after the same thing. Three men who don't trust each other and who can handle a pistol. The movie is violent, but fun. It takes place across many locations, right in the middle of Civil War action. The war is the backdrop, not the Old West. The whole thing is not quite like any other western film I've seen.IMDb currently rates this as #4 on its Top 250.

Everything about this movie was perfect. The direction, the score, the setting, the acting, everything. The characters are developed and are definitely memorable. This movie has it all, humor, action, adventure, drama, and definitely the greatest ending to a movie in the history of film. The plot of the story is definitely more than a simple hunt for treasure, morals are spread through out the film symbolically and explicitly.Sergio Leone's visionary, direction style is shown once again, and I can go on and on and on about it, but then i'd be writing for days upon days.Tuco, blondie, and Sentenza/Angel Eyes. Three of the most iconic, and memorable characters ever. Tuco displays the \"ugly\" side of people. Tuco is selfish, apathetic, a liar, a cheater, often two faced and down right dirty. Sentenza/Angel eyes is a cold hearted, sociopathic, bounty hunter, who does whatever it takes to get his job done. Blondie is not the typical good guy. He is amoral, greedy, and holds many of the characteristics as Tuco and Angel eyes. He is not the same type of good guy that John Wayne portrays, Blondie portrays a more realistic form of what a \"good guy\" would be in the west. Greed, dishonesty, and selfishness are traits we all have. Blondie however is the epitome of masculinity, with his poncho wearing, cigar smoking, quick with the pistol ways, and I cant help but admire him. What especially stands out about these characters is how they are able to accurately display human nature. Critics deem these characters as amoral, but everyone who exists on the planet is amoral in a certain sense. Sergio leone, and his great cast capture this reality in this epic adventure.\"$200,000 is a lot of money, we're gonna have to earn it.\" That line is definitely one of the greatest lines in the movie, as well as one of the most masculine. The final scenes from Tuco's ecstasy of the treasure to the Mexican standoff (which is one of the most creative and unexpected end to an epic western)left me in awe, along with ennio morricones ultimate score. People argue that this movie is just about a greedy treasure hunt, and can't live up to something as captivating as a revenge story, like once upon a time in the west. First of all it is not just a greedy treasure hunt, as i said before it is a trip into human nature, adventure and masculinity. Secondly, what it comes down to is your taste in movies. If you're a more masculine, adventurous person, you'll admire the good the bad and the ugly, but if your into revenge, and honor then once upon a time in the west is your movie. You can learn a lot about people by the movies they enjoy.Its just a shame that people today cannot enjoy this fantastic movie.

It's key is the trio of main characters who all bring something different to the table and all serve as integral ingredients to a film that might appear a mere adventure film on the surface, but which is both a comedy and character drama as well as a great war movie at the same time.Clint Eastwood's the Man with No Name, this time called Blondie, continues somewhat on the more ruthless note he took on from the previous film (For a Few Dollars More). However, he's not a truly malicious character but more of jerk-friend who is also extremely observant and at the end of the day doesn't stab anyone in the back so hard that they wouldn't get up again. This creates his rather odd relationship with Tuco.Lee Van Cleef's Angel Eyes is the very embodiment of evil as far as characters go. He wipes anyone who's in his way, is entirely devoid of any morals and generally manages to create a menacing mood with his presence. This is a stark contrast to the character he played in the previous film and made all the more unsettling by the fact that his appearance is almost identical to this character from the previous film, right down to the pipe.Eli Wallach as Tuco the Rat is easily the most memorable character from the film. Appearing at first filthy, amoral and without any redeeming qualities he is suddenly thrust into a wavering partnership and later, one could even say, a type of friendship with Blondie. We find out that there is more to Tuco than meets the eye though he never stops being the seemingly greedy scum that he is at the start, by the end of the film the viewer is even able to sympathise with him to a degree.What truly sets this film apart from other westerns and as well as the rest of the Dollars trilogy is that even in its close-to-three-hour length, the film doesn't feel excessively long.

The question is, will anything exceed them ever if we are talking about westerns. Unlike mainstream Hollywood westerns from 1950s and 1960s that were showing us idealistic picture of wild west of 19th century, with lots of patriotism and propaganda,these sometimes called \"spaghetti westerns\" are something completely different. Somebody said-\"John Wayne would never shoot to a guys back. Clint Eastwood would never have a problem with that.\" This main difference between typical representatives of these two different kinds of westerns is what sets them apart. It began with \"A fistful of dollars\" and continued with \"For a few dollars more\". With each next movie they were getting better and better. \"Good,bad,ugly\" is crown of all of them. Story about three men searching for 200.000 dollars in gold and without choosing ways to get them. This is a real story about wild west, story about real people without make up. People without almost any moral barrier, instead of idealistic characters shown in Hollywood westerns of that time who were unrealistic. In \"Dollars trilogy\" everything is based on interest- association,rivalry and fighting for money. Allies and enemies change over night depending on current interests. Characters of Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef were allies in \"For a few dollars more\" but enemies in \"Good,bad,ugly\". That was all based on interest. Man without name or Good (Clint Eastwood) is typical anti-hero,but you somehow feel that he is a good one. We know nothing about his past (that gets revealed in \"Once upon a time in the West\" with Charles Bronson) but there is something in him that makes us wish to be the way he is. He is ready to take the punch,but when he strikes back no one stays alive. And he always manages to outflank them. Like the rest he does everything from interest, but he is iconic figure because of what he is. Bad (Lee Van Cleef) is real bad guy who chooses no way to find out where the money is. He is calculated and ready to do everything necessary to satisfy his greed.Man without any moral brakes. And Ugly (Eli Wallach) known as Tuco Benedicto Pacifico Juan Maria Ramirez also known as Rat is comical in his greed and lack of any moral barriers. Slave of his own ego and instincts. His life credo is-\"When you want to shoot,don t talk,just shoot\". If he wants something, he wants it now. Man of revenge (\"If someone double crosses me and leaves me alive,he understands nothing about Tuco.Nothing\"). But he forgets about revenge if it comes to interest. In the end he is left with half of the money but stiff,scarred and angry which perfectly represents his personality.All three characters are allies and enemies depending on current situation and their interests as we see throughout the movie. The question remains until the end-who is going to outsmart who? And when they found a money there comes that final scene of gunfight between all three of them. Camera shows us their faces and eyes-we see what they feel and their personality. Good-Cold blooded and self-confident knowing that he controls the situation and with advantage because he knows that Ugly has no bullets in his gun (because he put them of from his gun when they were sleeping) and he can concentrate on Bad, but Bad and Ugly know nothing about that so they have to concentrate on each other and Good, which puts them in difficult situation in favor of Good. Bad-Calculated and moving around thinking who is he going to shoot first-Good or Ugly? Ready to fire in any moment. And Ugly-Scarred and also thinking who to shoot first. He is in most difficult situation. Such a dramatic psychological scene. And everything is over in seconds,Good fires first and kills Bad,Ugly has nothing to fire with as he discovered in that moment with feel of anger about Good. What a perfection in filming. Good leaves with half of the money and leaves Ugly with another half to continue to hate him for the rest of his life. Film has excellent soundtrack-opening melody, melody when Ugly runs on graveyard searching for money and the best melody-scene of final gunfight. There are also other good melodies in movie. In my opinion \"Good,bad,ugly\" is second best western ever made after \"Once upon a time in the West\" which is first.

Good Bad and Ugly was such an awesome, awesome film. From the second it began, I was glued to the screen, continuously wondering exactly what would happen next. Having watched it for the 2nd time last night, I am still unable to get this amazing piece of art out of my mind. There is no way possible that Sergio Leone is not the greatest director of all time. But enough of me rambling, let me give a reason for my madness.....This film has some of the best acting you will ever find from an allstar cast. Clint Eastwood returns in his role as The Man With No Name, or as he is referred to in this particular film, Blondie, and he plays the role flawlessly, supplying lots of memorable quotes in the process. And then there is Eli Wallach playing the comical bandit called Tuco. Tuco is one of the most hilarious characters ever in movie-making, and there are plenty of scenes where he makes an absolute fool of himself, as well as making others look like idiots in a very funny manner. Finally, there's Lee Van Cleef playing the role of ruthless hit-man Angel Eyes. Van Cleef does superbly in getting the audience to really despise the character he plays because he obviously puts so much emotion into playing the merciless Angel Eyes, who doesn't hesitate to kill ANYONE.....for the right price, that is.But it has been proved numerous times that good acting alone will not make a movie a classic. And fortunately, Leone's masterpiece features one of the most clever plots ever. The story revolves around gunslingers Blondie, Tuco, and Angel Eyes looking for a treasure of gold buried by Confederate troops in a remote cemetery. But here's the interesting part- none of them are able to find the gold without one of the two others. See, each of the three men know a vital fact about the location of the gold that the others need in order to find it. Tuco knows the name of the cemetery, Blondie knows the name of the grave the gold is buried under, and Angel Eyes, like Tuco, knows the name of the cemetery. With an innovative story like that, a director like Sergio Leone, and a stellar cast of actors like Eastwood, Wallach, and Van Cleef, you know ahead of time you are going to see something special. Everything unfolds at such a smooth pace throughout the film, and there are lots of interesting twists that keep you guessing.But there are two things about this film that stand out to me, even above the acting and story. And those two things are the musical score done by Ennio Morricone and the ending climax of this film. I won't say anything other than they are two things that need to be heard/seen by everyone.

Leone gets off on the grit: the beard-stubble, the sun-chapped lips, battered hat-brim and dirty leather boot. Not only is this the greatest Western ever made it may also stand as the greatest visual story ever committed to film. Leone is so genuinely fascinated by this period and its mythology that every frame is full and compelling... action occurs in both sprawling long shots and lightning bursts of quick-cut gunshot.

Most other action films, especially westerns, are celebrations of cool, but this film masters cool -- heck, practically invents it -- and also applies it sensibly. Nothing is merely for cool's sake, it is for the sake of telling a story full of mistrust as well as one that searches for depth in the blanket adjectives of its title.Set in the West during the Civil War, the film identifies its characters right away: The Good, Blondie (Eastwood), The Bad, Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), and The Ugly, Tuco (Eli Wallach). Each is after nothing but money, making the word associations merely relative to the principles that they live by. Distrusting of one another, they are soon forced to work together -- specifically Tuco and Blondie -- in order to find 200 K in buried gold, because one of them knows which cemetery it's buried in and the other knows which grave.Gold is also every word that comes out of Clint Eastwood's mouth. Although his body of work today is enough proof of his talent, he clearly owes much of his career to director/writer Sergio Leone. In this their third western collaboration, Leone knows what Eastwood's strengths are and he gives him some killer lines. Every man supposedly wants to be James Bond, but every American man should want to be Blondie. Every time he speaks, you know you're either going to be impressed or enlightened with his machismo and/or wisdom. Wallach is also invaluable to the film as Tuco. He keeps things interesting playing a money- grubbing rat. In a film of this length, he helps keep things from getting too serious and dull.Leone also hones his craft in this movie. His gritty close-ups and split-second gunfire shots give this film its style, suspense and power. There's some \"it\" quality to his film-making that is hard to describe, but every shot feels important or at the least cool. Distinct \"chapter\" breaks also contribute to the Western mythos/tall tale idea that has made the genre an important one of the 20th century. There is a clear journey-like story line that recalls what made Homer's \"The Odyssey\" one of the first great Western (in the global sense) literary classics. There is a clear objective with obvious obstacles, unlikely partnerships and plenty of surprises.If all that wasn't enough, there's the score. Ennio Morricone not only provides one of the most memorable themes in movie music history, but the timing of the music, the way it lifts the important scenes up into a realm of cinematic immortality is unlike anything before or since it. It's exciting and epic when it needs to and it's suspenseful and emotional when the action gets intense. With so much silence in this film, picking the right moments to break it is challenging, but Morricone nails it. And if it doesn't do all that for you, well, it's still cool.\"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\" proves that all three of those descriptors are relative. It's no great revelation, but it's interesting to see how you watch and form opinions of characters assigned to general moral stereotypes and then to see how those opinions are affected as the film goes on.

When you go to a fine restaurant and spend half your paycheck on a piece of meat, you unconsciously force yourself into denial that that piece of meat is the best you've ever eaten. Even if you would have been more content with McDonald's. Why? Because you just spent half your paycheck on it, and some French guy somewhere says it's fine meat, thus you have to agree. You HAVE to. You're unwilling to admit your disappointment. You tell yourself that your taste buds just aren't evolved enough, even though that is just stupid. It works the same way with movies. Once you've seen 500 pages of perfect reviews, read that the film received 100% rating from professional critics, admitting to yourself that you weren't content with the film isn't easy. It's even harder to admit it to other people. It's nearly impossible to write a review stating it. This opening paragraph can apply to thousands of movies. But this is how I felt about The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly. It wasn't bad, but it lacked the full contentment I expected.Emphasis on story/plot has died out over the years. In 2009, top critics put only slightly more emphasis on it as they put on the color of the main character's shirt. Perhaps this is why we see movies, forget about them, go see another one just like the last one, forget about it: repeat the same hollow cycle until we die. Aristotle put story at the center of all fictional work; modern critics put cinematography and acting at the center. Whether you side with an ancient dead guy or bitter middle-aged men devoid of sex lives, it's hard to deny that the latter mindset just leads to pretty moving pictures and eventually is completely forgettable. That is the main flaw I had with The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.While this film has purely awesome moving pictures (more on that later), the plot is weak. In fact, it's so weak and so predictable that I found that I could quickly care less about anything happening. For the film's credit, I will say that the predictable linier plot did have some quirky variation, and added scenes that you wouldn't normally expect in a Western. However, the fact that the driving force of this epic film is nothing but a clich\u00e9 treasure hunt is the reason I found it so lacking. Couldn't the writers have been a little more creative? If they had been, this would have been an absolute perfect film. If they had been, there would be nothing for me to criticize. Even those who already find this a perfect film, can you really deny that a little more creativity would have made it even more perfect? Furthermore, the Civil War scenes pumped an even more annoying vibe into The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly because they were just copy/pasted from generic war films. They added nothing but another layer of seen-this-thousand-times to a generic plot that was already getting annoying because I've seen it a thousand times. And none of this criticism is from a modern standpoint. Everything I just criticized was unoriginal in its time.What was good was the ugly. You've read this part in hundreds of other reviews, so I'm not going to take much time here. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly perfected true grit like never before. That's where the credit lies. From rugged faces to rugged deserts to rugged clothing to rugged buildings to rugged camera style, nothing was left of the sanitized world we live in. Some people criticize the realism of this and the realism of other aspects of the film, to which I say: I just don't care. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly can be taken as a mature fantasy set in a overdone western world\u0097what's wrong with that? People also criticize the film by saying it's not as good as its prequels, which is a matter of taste. However, it isn't a matter of taste that the prequels didn't even come close to the epic scope or raw grit of this film. They didn't have the brutal nihilism of the characters. They were more polished, with tight conventional plotting and less overt backdrops.Another incorrect criticism of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is that it is nothing but a macho, quirky, masculinity-fest with no bearing on the realistic world. Those people make me laugh. The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly pretty much singlehandedly brought the nameless antihero into cinema. While this character really gets annoying in modern films, he works here because he was one of the first, as well as one of the best. While I will agree that he has little bearing on real life, it's the secondary characters that break the clich\u00e9. The title of the film as well as the film itself both illustrate the opposite that the typical period western would illustrate: the world is not black-and-white. Good doesn't always win. People can stand on both sides of the moral line. Good guys can do immoral things. It's here that the true underline genius comes out, because this is something even modern filmmakers don't understand.Overall, there is nothing I can say to shake people from the belief that The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is the best film ever made. Be it due to nostalgia, or be it due to a level of depth I missed, I can't change that. I'm not trying to. But I just want to say that The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is typical in some aspects.

In fact their brilliant portrayals have immortalized Blondie, Sentenza/ Angel Eyes and the enigmatic Tuco. Lee Van Cleef is fiendishly unforgiving as the merciless Angel Eyes. Clint Eastwood is rugged yet suave, cocky yet adorable as laconic cigar-smoker Blondie, a role that laid the foundations of his illustrious career.

Wallach is amusing, capricious, nonchalant, uncanny and yet tenacious as Tuco, perturbed by his insecurities and dampened by his solitude. It is the tacit amicability between Blondie and Tuco and their mutual hostility towards the evil Angel Eyes owing to the vestiges of virtue present in them, redolent of their moribund morality, which gives the story, the impetus and the characters, a screen presence that is not only awe inspiring but also unparalleled.Sergio Leone's magnificent and ingenious direction in synergy with Ennio Morricone's surreal music, Tonino Delli Colli's breathtaking cinematography and Joe D'Augustine's punctilious editing makes the movie, a treat to watch and ineffably unforgettable.

If you can't get enough of this type of movie, rather than wasting your time with the mostly substandard 400 to 500 hundred remaining Eurowesterns (the vast majority of which stink to high heaven), I would recommend trying the Clint Eastwood films Hang 'Em High (1968), Two Mules for Sister Sara (1970), Joe Kidd (1972), High Plains Drifter (1973), Outlaw Jose Wales (1976), Pale Rider (1985) and Unforgiven (1992). Obviously, they aren't spaghetti westerns, but the Leone kinship is obvious. Think of them as the Leone/Eastwood films they never got around to making together.Also, the films of Sam Peckinpah, especially, The Wild Bunch (1969), The Ballad of Cable Hogue (1970) and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1972), which were also key films in the \"deconstruction\" of the Western. Oh, McCabe and Mrs. Miller (1971) by Robert Altman is another key film.P.S. By all means, avoid Spanish \"Paella\" Westerns, which are even worse than the very worst Italian made ones. Especially A Town Called Hell (1971) by Eugenio Martin, it is absolutely lousy despite the stellar cast.P.P.S. Contrary to what some people may try to tell you, there are no Late Spaghetti Classics (after 1973). No, Keoma, Four of the Apocalypse and China 9, Liberty 37 are not lost classics, they are pretentious, preposterous failures, deservedly (and mercifully) forgotten.

Having watched many westerns in my childhood i could have sworn that i had seen The Good , The Bad and the Ugly . Surely everyone of a certain age has? Well as it turns out i probably hadn't , or if i had i remember nothing of it. This is the final film of the Sergio Leone \" \"Dollars\" or \" man with no name\" trilogy of which i have been watching recently and although this is the most famous of the three ' for me it's not quite the best . Blondie (The Good) and Tuco (The Ugly) are con artists, trying to steal as much money as possible during the Civil War. Angel Eyes (The Bad) is trying to locate a bank robber going by the name of Bill Carson, in order to collect his stolen gold. After a few scams, Blondie cheats Tuco by keeping his share and leaving him in the dust.Tuco eventually finds Blondie and drags him off into the desert, torturing him in revenge. Then they run into Bill Carson, who tells Tuco the location of a graveyard where his stolen gold is buried. As Tuco looks for water to keep Carson alive long enough to help more, Carson tells Blondie which gravestone marks the buried gold, and dies before he can say more. Angel Eyes soon figures out that they know, and all three want a 50% share of the gold, but only two of them will get it.The amazing thing about this superb trilogy is that they all were made within three years. Each movie having it's budget increased. A fistful of dollars - 200K . A few Dollars more - 600K and finally the good , The bad and the ugly 1.1m. In the latter it really shows that leone had a lot more money to spend. Lavish sets , a huge amount of personnel and no doubt an increased salary for the ever popular Clint Eastwood and Lee Van cleef but as any movie fan will tell you an increased budget does not always make a better film .I have no doubt which is my favourite of the trilogy and that is \" A few dollars More\" . It is the perfect western. This film is not, simply because it's trying to do too much. It's an hour too long and the plot drifts off in different directions. Sure it has all the superb hallmarks of a Sergio Leone western. It looks amazing , it has a wonderful soundtrack and it finishes with typical tense showdown but it's the bits inbetween namely the civil war scenes that distract from what should have been an amazing western. Angel eyes , the lee van Cleef's character is not engaging enough and i would have loved to have seen him return as Col. Douglas Mortimer who we saw in the previous film instead we get a character who is given third billing behind Blondie and Tuco. In fact the best character is Tuco ' who is played by Eli Wallach and he gets the vast majority of the screen time.This lacks the brutality of the previous films and maybe that is because Sergio Leone was going for that wider audience. 8 out of 10", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 4}, "heading": "Not as good as A few Dollars More", "date": "2009-02-05T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2018535", "sentiment score": [0.0045, 0.0318, 0.2501, 0.5877, 0.126]}, {"content": "\"Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo\" is a great movie, and ties for my 1st place among westerns.

I found it a little slow in the beginning and that is the only thing that keeps me from awarding 10 stars. From the moment that Tuco finds out about the gold, no western (or movie at all) is better. Van Cleef is very good as Angel Eyes, Wallach is even better as Tuco, and Clint himself is as always PERFECT as \"The man with no name\".The movie ticks in at 175 minutes, which is very long even though it didn't feel like it after the slow first half hour or so. It has a complex story, unlike the aforementioned \"first\" spaghetti, much happens before the good, bad and the ugly gets on track of the treasure, and even more happens after they begin to seek it.

This is a genre I tried my best to avoid. I am more into thrillers. But this one was special.The plot is interesting in itself. 3 men are determined to get to the cash box that was buried under the ground in a certain place(trying my best not to reveal the plot here!). The excitement is in watching the many twists unfold. The characters are known as Blondie, Tuco and Angel eyes. The real names of the characters are not revealed here. We come to know a little more about Tuco in the course of the movie. It could be said that Tuco is the central character in this movie as he appears in most of the movie. The plot moves throughout America and they go in search of the cash box even to war torn areas. The story is set in the late 1800's during the civil war. So the movie also effectively works as an anti-war movie as well.The most impressive thing about this movie is the great music by the legend Ennio Morricone. This might be the best ever music I have ever heard in movies. Maybe that's an exaggeration but surely this is one of the best. The music in the scene where Tuco searches frantically for the cash box is filmed brilliantly and the music builds into a crescendo at the end of the scene. Another aspect that impressed me is the beautiful cinematography in certain scenes of the movie. The long shots showing the beauty of the place are absolutely breathtaking. The war scenes are shot well and I was surprised to hear about the budget. With this budget I was surprised to see the advanced effects and the meticulous depiction of the war.I also came to understand a few things about a part of history I didn't know - the American Civil war. The bridge destruction scene is also another one I totally loved. The closeups of the character's faces is also another feature that I liked specifically about the movie - especially when they are actors with such great screen presence such as Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach. I have never thought of Clint Eastwood as particularly good looking or talented. But this movie proved me wrong. His performance as the calm bounty hunter with a sense of humour enhanced his image considerably in my eyes. His quiet sexiness is something I have never seen in other movies of his(Maybe I am biased because I saw only his newer movies). Lee Van Cleef is notable for his portrayal of the villain. Eli Wallach's portrayal of the crooked and funny Tuco is IMO one of the best characters in movies ever. His line \"When you want to shoot, shoot, don't talk\" has become one of my favourite quotes as well.Finally this movie has encouraged me to seek out more \"Sphagetti Westerns\" and regular classic Westerns as well. The movie is quite a classic and is highly recommended for all movie fans because it is more of an exciting adventure movie with beautiful camera-work than a Western.10/10", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Impressive western, masterful music", "date": "2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1999855", "sentiment score": [0.0091, 0.0643, 0.2441, 0.5507, 0.1318]}, {"content": "Clint Eastwood returns as The Man With No Name in this final installment in Sergio Leone's epic Dollars Trilogy (or Man With No Name Trilogy). He plays Blondie (the Good), a sharp-shooter of debatable honor, iron will, and questionable motives. Leone also brings back Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes (the Bad), a sadistic man who always keeps his promises \u0096 as long as you pay him for it. Eli Wallach rounds out the trio as Tuco (the Ugly), a thief worried only about his own hide. The three men are held together by the wish to locate a stash of gold, its location imparted to them by a dying man. Alas, things are not so simple. The man whispers some of the information to Tuco, but only Blondie knows the true location. And so our thieves must overcome backstabbing and betrayal, as well as their mutual enemy of Angel Eyes, to reach the treasure.Sergio Leone creates a visual masterpiece. Not even Orson Welles can hold the audience in his hands the way Leone can. The cinematography and editing are perfectly in sync, working together to mold the audience as Leone sees fit. The famous Mexican standoff, with its rapid-fire cutting and incredibly close shots, is jaw dropping, forcing you to hold your breath. And of course, the film simply could not work without Ennio Morricone's incredible (I repeat, incredible) score. Even if you don't bother seeing the movie, look up The Ecstasy of Gold on YouTube. It will leave you speechless and blow your mind.After a disastrous experience with my first foray into Westerns (for the record, \"Shane\" is a horrific movie), I all but damned the entire genre to the pits of hell.

With its superb cast, its beautiful and wide scenery, and its superior action sequences, this film is a masterpiece. A picture that embodies the perfect personification of masculinity. A true man's picture, and one that will stand tall among most movies today.The simple tale of how three gunslingers form an unlikely alliance of hate, in order to find $200,000 (that's $6 million by today's standards) worth of stolen gold, in a country that is ravaged by war, is elegantly told by the maestro of westerns, Sergio Leone. For its time, Spaghetti Westerns were not considered genuine art, but rather, entertainment instead. Sergio Leone is probably the only director who is smart enough to make his film compelling to mainstream and critical audiences alike. His direction is smart and strong, and you see how well his direction is as per the amount of manpower and creativity in handling the action sequences. The action sequences are raw, crisp, grand, explosive, and taut. Especially the Standoff at the end. Leone should probably be awarded a Nobel Prize for that scene alone. Leone is probably why westerns are popular among the youth of the '60s, hell, he probably influenced would be filmmakers at the time. I know of one who was particularly influenced by Leone's direction - Quentin Tarantino himself said that this film is the best-directed film of all time. And yes, although the film may be long, there's not a scene that goes by that you'll say boring.Clint Eastwood - The Good. The legendary Man With No Name. His character perfectly embodies with the true meaning of masculinity. As per in his previous films, he plays a mysterious gunslinger, one with a deadly aim and a strong sense of honor and pride. He is the perfect hero, and this film stands out as one of Clint's, if not his, best film ever.Lee Van Cleef - The Bad. Here, instead of the fatherly Doug Mortimer in the previous \"For A Few Dollars More\", we get the stone-cold assassin Angel Eyes. Van Cleef plays him chillingly to the bone. He is wicked, he is ruthless, he is cruel. He would kill anyone, be it his targets or even his own client.Eli Wallach - The Ugly. He is Tuco, a criminal on the loose. He is the most interesting character in the film, as we see the ugly side of man through him. He is two-faced, slimy, arrogant, and hate-able. But that what makes his character great. There is no substitution for Wallach, he will always be Tuco no matter what.The cinematography is absolutely beautiful. We get to see the backdrop of the glorious Wild West and the battlefields of war in all its unfaded glory. Even the cemetery scene is filmed extremely well. The music - that's another thing. The music, is masterful, so sublime, so grandiose, and so haunting. It's mesmerizing, really, to hear the great Ennio Morricone's score while looking at the actions of people, it perfectly matches the film. Not forgetting to mention the iconic and haunting theme song that's embodied itself in popular culture even until today.So, yes, this is truly cinematic brilliance. If you want to see the film in all it's glory, I reckon you readers get the extended cut DVD of the film. It's Leone's true version of this film, and it would do you some good to see his true film, not to mention the remastered picture and 5.1 sound so that you can hear the gunshots and explosions in all its fury.

The DVD cannot do it justice.In spite of historical inaccuracies, some preposterous scenarios and other plot weaknesses, brutal violence, some awful acting, and lip-sync problems with the Italian actors, it is a great film that engaged me completely for three hours.It is visually stunning with Leone's extreme close ups and its recreation of the time of the American Civil War. The protracted scenes (often whole stories in themselves) add to the visual poetry and to the evocation of the time.It is Leone's homage to the classic American Western. It relies heavily on the standard Western conventions but it is not constrained by them. Leone does it with his tongue planted firmly in his cheek. It should not be taken literally or even seriously and should be enjoyed for what it is.The characters are multidimensional. Eastwood's non-acting and Wallach's over the top performance add to rather than detract from the movie.It is possibly the most accurate portrayal of the American Civil War on film, showing it as the brutal and senseless conflict that it was.Its comments on greed, violence and human nature are poignant and yet the humor leavens the lessons.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "See it in High Definition", "date": "2008-09-18T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1948058", "sentiment score": [0.0211, 0.0992, 0.2092, 0.5159, 0.1546]}, {"content": "like Lawrence of Arabia, I saw this in infomercial free late nite TV.

Picking up clues, and with many criss-crossing adventures en route, they each make their way to the treasure. Can they find it, and who will emerge alive ?The Good, The Bad And The Ugly, or Il Buono, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo to give it it's proper name, is simply the finest western ever made. Many accused Leone of being a hack; he made westerns, but he made them in Spain, and he wasn't even an American. Not only was he not a hack, he made pure cinema - a genre stylist unburdened by all the boring moral constraints of so many westerns (clean-cut good guys, white supremacy, social responsibility). As a result, this film is the purest distillation of the western myth, with the most amazing cinematic treatment ever committed to film. Its style is beyond criticism and its influence cannot be underestimated; Leone's themes, his camera angles, his use of music, his intuitive widescreen style, his moves, his incredible closeups - all have been and continue to be copied by lesser men. At a time when everyone was making crappy new age films like Barefoot In The Park and Georgy Girl, Leone was going back to his cinematic childhood of Gone With The Wind to create an astonishingly mythic epic which is the greatest depiction of the American Civil War despite not being about it. The three main characters are larger than life in the best way possible; Eastwood is extraordinary as The Man With No Name here, his character gradually mellowing from the hardened bounty-hunter he was as he witnesses the horrors of the war. If you do not cry at the scene near the end where this hardest of hard men dispassionately comforts a dying boy you are truly heartless. Wallach is amazing as Tuco, giving one of the greatest physical performances I have ever seen, all darting eyes, fastidious little movements and operatic comedy; he can be scary, funny, vicious and tender, all in the same scene. Van Cleef on the other hand is the purest depiction of black-hearted evil in any film. His introduction, as he rides a black horse out of a desert sundown and commits three horrific murders is amongst the greatest screen villainy of all time. These three incredible turns are all-time career bests for three astonishingly talented and prolific actors. Also superb are Guiffr\u00e8 as the doomed drunken Yankee Captain Clinton, Pistilli as Tuco's brother Pablo and Brega as Wallace, Van Cleef's burly henchman (Brega plays similar heavies in the two previous Dollar movies). The other unforgettable element to this movie is Ennio Morricone's astounding music, which I think I must say is simply the greatest score ever recorded. There is no movie I can name with better, more original or dynamic music. The music is in unique harmony with the images and emotes from the first note to the last crescendo. The music completes every scene. It is lustful, haunting, touching, humorous, ominous, grandiose, suspenseful, operatic, delicious, magnificent, riveting, quiet, melancholy and philosophical. There are too many great musical moments to mention, but perhaps the greatest of all is the L'Estasi Dell'Oro sequence as a crazed Tuco runs amongst the graves of Sad Hill accompanied by the silken soprano voice of Edda Dell'Orso. Morricone is probably the most gifted film composer who has ever lived - he is certainly the most prolific - and this is the finest of his many many great scores. In an average movie I hope for maybe five strong scenes with atmosphere and originality. In this long movie, every single scene, bar none, is a brilliant little vignette, yet each flows into the other with perfect rhythm. What else is there to say about this extraordinarily beautiful film ? It is a diamond, an absolute diamond of world cinema, made by one of the few truly original directors, and don't believe for a second anyone who tries to write it off as trashy or simplistic. It contains so many moments of pure storytelling genius it would take me forever to list them. It is a great story, an astounding assault on the senses, a hugely entertaining masterpiece and an everlasting testament to Leone's total command of cinema. Featuring exquisite photography by Tonino Delli Colli and fantastic sets by Carlo Simi, it was shot at Elios Studios in Rome, in Castilla-Leon in northern Spain and in Leone's favoured locations in Almeria. Stunningly well written by Agenore Incrocci, Furio Scarpelli, Luciano Vincenzoni and Leone. Re-mastered and re-released in 2003, with several additional scenes which didn't make it into the original US release, notably a sequence where Tuco reunites with his gang and one where Angel Eyes visits a ruined fort. Trivia - Eastwood/Blondy is the good (buono), Wallach/Tuco is the ugly (brutto) and Van Cleef/Angel Eyes is the bad (cattivo); the latter two are often transposed in much of the English-language publicity and merchandise for the movie.

Also, they were westerns. But there's nothing distinctly Italian about spaghetti westerns... except maybe the flair for spectacular overacting.As a genre, it reached its peak in the mid-60s, even though it was still relatively young at the time. Today it's misunderstood, made fun of, or loved. Which is okay: that makes it like just about every other genre of film, thus validating its cultural significance.None of the spaghetti westerns are more significant, though, than Sergio Leone's. His Man with No Name Trilogy is much beleaguered and loved today, as is the underwhelming Once Upon a Time in the West, a film most memorable for featuring Henry Fonda as a villain. But of the Trilogy, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly -- the third installment that is actually the most basic of the three -- is something miraculous. The movie's tagline was \"For three men, the Civil War wasn't Hell -- it was practice!\" While that may seem like a silly tagline, the movie is not: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, Dr. Strangelove, and Pulp Fiction each go down in my book as the greatest cool movies of all time.But you may be asking: how does a western, shot in Spain with an entire cast speaking only Spanish except for the principle three stars, directed by an Italian with a fetish for the Civil War, with hardly any dialogue and a plot with more holes in it than the fishnet your local deli makes its employees wear -- well, how does that work? Quite simply... I don't know. I just know that The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is one of the best times I've ever had watching a movie. The plot revolves around $200,000 in gold coins. Blondie (Clint Eastwood, and \"the Good\" in the title) is after it, as are Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef, \"the Bad\") and Tuco (Eli Wallach, \"the Ugly\"). That's the plot. Yeah, really.Sergio Leone is famous for his camera direction, his quick cut close-ups with alternating wide shots. Here is no different. In fact, it's remarkable to note how few regular shots are used -- or, if they are more common than I perceived, how well the close-ups and wide shots are executed so as to draw attention to themselves.Equally famous is the way in which Leone could drag out a showdown. While nothing in this film quite matches the incredible 15-minute standoff from Once Upon a Time in the West, it is still fun to watch the final sequence, as the three square off to see who would live long enough to find the gold coins.But more than these trademarks -- how about that score? Ennio Morricone, whose work is vastly under-appreciated and is pigeonholed too easily, created a theme here that is simultaneously catchy, memorable, and chilling.So maybe that's it. What makes The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly work is the expressive combination of the genius of each individual, wildly-varying ingredient of this pasta gumbo. It looks awful on paper, but, heh, so did The White Album, and we all know how that turned out.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Dub at your own risk", "date": "2008-08-29T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1937555", "sentiment score": [0.045, 0.298, 0.4638, 0.1726, 0.0207]}, {"content": "Once every few years, a movie pops up that thousands or maybe even millions consider to be one of the best films ever made. The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is definitely one of those few. Blondie (Clint Eastwood), Tuco (Eli Wallach) and Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) are three men who are in search of gold coins that are buried in a cemetery. However, each man only knows a certain amount of information as to where the gold is and are therefore dependent on each other.The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is an incredibly suspenseful movie and will have you on the edge of your seat throughout. The action scenes are top-notch and really kick in the tension. The famous showdown at the cemetery seriously had me guessing as to what the hell was going to happen to the point of being wide-eyed and I'm sure that it's the most suspenseful scene in cinema history.Although Clint Eastwood gives an excellent performance as Blondie, it's Eli Wallach who shines as Tuco. The audience has a strange, ever-changing relationship with his character. At some points (mainly early on) we hate his guts and at other points we love him and can't get enough of him. He actually had me laughing quite a few times such as when he takes a desperate but brilliant measure to break free from his handcuffs. I won't ruin it for you, but it involves a train.Even if you haven't seen the movie, you WILL recognise its theme tune. Ennio Morricone's music is one of the best things about The Good, The Bad And The Ugly and its theme tune is certainly among the greatest of all time.The thing that amazed me about the film is that it keeps you entertained and interested throughout its three hour length.

It's considered a classic because of Ennio Morricone iconic theme and because it has Clint Eastwood in it. The plot what plot. There is not consistent plot. Only action scenes upon action scenes pieced together to create a three hour long bore fest. I think I would rather take the three hour tour in Gillian's Island and get shipwrecked on a island then watch this turd again. It's as if Sergio Leone who made a masterpiece with Once Upon a Time in the West and another great film in Fistful of Dollars went to his screenwriter and said lets make a film with many showcased action sequences and piece them together with our twenty page screenplay. The result a paper thin, very thin story with no solid characterization or development.The movie is more like the adventures of the man with no name and his annoying nerdy partner Tuco who can't shut the hell up. The pair play one another in con games, shootouts, duels, and other antics. They both happen to fall upon a deserted stage wagon full of dead men where they learn the secret to ones fate of hidden gold. They both end up in a Civil War prison camp, right in the middle of a Civil War battle and other clueless adventures in a story that might have been written by a couple of adolescents. Just one adventure after another that has nothing to do with telling a strong story. This film is like a clumsy, sloppy serial with no motivation by any of the characters involved.The one thing that make Sergio Leone films so great is the style and action. The action sequences in the film are dull and not the least bit engaging. The Civil War battles look way too much like a World War battle. The duels and showdowns that were so thrilling and fun to watch in the previous two films I mentioned are drawn out here in very long and tiresome sequences. Especially the duel climax which is almost laughable which consists of endless and endless shots of eyes, guns, expressions. The whole thing last for a total of 5 minutes and after it ends the viewer like me is not excited, but more relieved that it's over. Any longer I would of fast forwarded it. Other sequences such as showdowns in western towns are mere cartoonish and over the top.Even Leone's style of film-making isn't impressive. There are some shots that amuse me, especially the desert sequence which had artistic look to it. However, because of so many drawn out long boring sequences I really start losing focus on the art of film-making and really don't care anymore about this shot or that shot. That's not the case in Once Upon a Time in the West or Fistful of Dollars.As for the characters in the film. Clint Eastwood's portrayal of the man with no name is no longer mysterious or cool like he was in Fistful of Dollars. I've never seen the second man with no name film. In this film he's more of a spoof. Talks very little, but he's way to silly and not serious enough. As for Elliah Wallach his role of Tuco is way too comic and not the least bit intimating. He's also extremely annoying and he's also ugly. As for Lee Van Cliff his turn as Angel Eyes is the only character that I somewhat enjoyed. He played the part well with his narrow eyes, but he was in far too little of the film.Too sum it all up I'm extremely disappointed at the final result of this film. So many people love it. I don't know why. My theory is that the ones who love it are too dumb to realize why they like it and don't know what a great film is. Once Upon a Time in the West is a great film and so is Fistful of Dollars. I've seen The Good the Bad and the Ugly three times now and every time I watch it I hate more and more.

Not so much a case of pornography of violence as pornography of sadism: there is violence aplenty, both of the movie stereotype kind where every shot is an instant kill, and of brutal bloody beatings, but the real mark of this film lies in the long-drawn-out sequences of anticipation, as a man is told how he will die and then the process prolonged to attain the full pleasures of revenge. Having experienced at least three vicarious hangings and two deaths by thirst, not to mention a starvation diet and several stalkings-with-guns, with nerves jumping at every minute, I was as wrung out by the end of the picture as if it had been an explicit horror movie -- save that horror movies generally end in catharsis of some kind, the victory of good over evil, the exposure of sanity onto our darkest fears. Leone's film is not just 'morally ambiguous' but morally absent; in this world, everything is filthy, corrupt or brutalised, from the idealistic commandant dying of gangrene to the eager anticipation of the townsfolk at the hanging. It's pretty hard to watch. If asked to date this film offhand I'd have put it in the 1970s, for it shares much of the nihilism of the critical favourites of that decade.I've rated it as high as I have because it is both effective at what it does and memorable; it also has a strain of occasional mordant humour, skilfully deployed to relieve otherwise unrelenting degradation.

Fortunately, that's not much! For the genre that it represents, it is excellent. As a movie, it is very, very good.The soundtrack, often imitated, never duplicated or surpassed; provides exaggerated suspense and unintentional comic relief through out the movie. It also creates an atmosphere and texture for the movie, that many other movies might benefit from.The camera work is good. There is lots of great scenery, rapid change ups from landscapes to close ups of the actor's faces; and other interesting use of the camera, at times. At other times, there is a lazy quality to the shot choice that highlights the movement or plot at the moment.The characters are archetypes, and as such, don't stray too much from their respective modes. There are moments when I wished for a bit more, but there was plenty of true to form moments from the major characters that made up for a lack of further development or dimensionality. Stark, interesting, comic, tragic (if you will) and intense. Good acting all around, with Eastwood giving a trademark performance, later to be more fully developed as Dirty Harry, as a comic and merciless but just defender of his own ethic.The film has some funny scenes, and also, it has some places where it starts to drags. It's 2 hours and 45 minutes long, so it does take a certain suspension of time to sit through it all. Worth it though! Especially, if you happen to like rough and rugged westerns. I think that Sergio Leone's brilliance is overlooked in the direction and screenplay of this movie. There is something so classically cheesy and yet at the same time universally comic and tragic about the unfolding of events.As an example, I was particularly struck by the scene in the graveyard where the three men are about to dual over the sum of $200,000 in gold coins. Truly a king's ransom. The interesting counter point being that it is a soldier's graveyard, and that most, if not all of those buried there died in the pursuit of much less then that.The ideas of greed, confusion and ignorance were also interestingly intermixed throughout the movie. While at the end of the movie money is given a gold star (so to speak) all the tragedy and malice throughout the rest of the movie can be tied directly to it.There is a fair amount of violence in this film, which counts against it. Over all, I have a very positive response after viewing this one. Thumbs up, and with the right people, those who might laugh along with me, I'd be happy to see this one again.Plot synopsis.At the beginning of the film we are introduced to the three major characters who are defined as: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. The might as well have been introduced as The not so bad compared to a wolf; definitely Mean and the completely evil one. However, this would have robbed the movie of its pretensions to be a moral tale of some kind, or perhaps just obscured it's spiritual (?) message a bit deeper. Anyway.The three characters compete with one another to see how many people the can kill, or lives that they can ruin. The good guy starts out by killing three people, so he has a good start! As the movie progresses, we see them each killing various other people, and threatening to kill one another. Except for the good guy; his utterances are generally followed through with actions. Anyway.They each become aware of the existence of the some of gold earlier mentioned. Actually, the bad knows about the gold at the beginning of the film.Well, suffice it to say that there is a lot of shenanigans, and then at the end of the movie, there is a showdown. Lots of thematic mood music, and then each of the three gets their just desserts: The Bad dies, The Ugly get stranded in a graveyard with his hands tied behind his back with more gold then he can carry at his feet; and the Good rides out of the graveyard with the other half of the gold. All the other stuff in the middle, is just plot devices, and chances for the characters to show their archetypes in action: not worth repeating, save to say that it was easy to follow, entertaining, and epic in scope as it involved the United States civil war as a backdrop. Entertaining, engrossing and in the final analysis a bit over worked and long.

I was never a huge fan of the Western genre until I watched this film and was perpetually astounded. This film sets the standard for so many other Westerns and other great films, in general. And some of the best scenes in film history are all in this wonderful film.The story depicts three men, portrayed as good, bad and ugly, and their constant interactions with one another, in their attempts to find a stash of gold somewhere in the desert. I won't spoil any of the story here, but the film develops these characters magnificently and introduces all sorts of conflicts for these three characters to tackle. The actors themselves who portray these characters do an outstanding job. Clint Eastwood as the Man with No Name or The Good does a brilliant job and shows that he was and continues to be at the very vanguard of the Western genre. Eli Wallach as the opportunistic and savage Tuco or The Ugly, does an excellent job inspiring disgust, sympathy and pity, sometimes all at once. And Lee Van Cleef plays his role marvelously giving us a true canon villain and a great ingredient to the already spicy mix of Eastwood and Wallach.The shots in this film are breathtaking as Leone shoots wide, panoramic shots of the Southwestern desert and gives the viewer a feeling of the openness and freedom. Shot during the Civil War, Leone captures the struggle and violence of the conflict in a multitude of scenes. I won't spoil one scene in any way, but Leone creates a devastating image when Eastwood and Wallach find themselves in a Union camp. Leone has shown that Westerns can be visually beautiful as well.The film really pushes the genre and gives all sorts of depth to the characters and the plot. Ultimately, Leone gives the viewer one of the most intense and satisfying climaxes in film history. I assure you that you won't be disappointed. The film contains so many archetypes of the old West but also new, fresh and shifting paradigms that we, now in the present day, consider standard. There is just so much to like about this film that I can't really present in words. One thing I'll say is that despite the large amount of stale and same Westerns, this one stands out as something unique and truly is something special. Like I said, this is my favorite film of all time on a hotly contested list and while I'm not sure if that'll change in the future, this film will continue to endure and is a beautiful Western and a beautiful film, in general.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 3}, "heading": "My Favorite Film of all Time", "date": "2008-07-21T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1915257", "sentiment score": [0.0025, 0.0068, 0.0261, 0.367, 0.5977]}, {"content": "Il Buono! Il Brutto! Il Cattivo! Indeed, there isn't a lot of bad to be talked about. And ugly certainly isn't the word. But good, now you're on to something. If there was any doubt that a western could be regarded as a truly great film, 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly' solves that problem. And though it is without question one of the greatest westerns ever made, Sergio Leone's masterpiece is also one of the greatest crime dramas to be told. An epic rendering where the landscapes and score play as much of a role as do the actors, this spaghetti western is still today a suspenseful and glorious work of extreme art.A haunting story about three men brought together in unlikely ways in their search for a dead man's golden treasure, there's a brutal and gritty feel about the film as it drops us in the middle of a barren and dry landscape. Raw, but also indescribably beautiful. Sergio Leone paints his canvas both with grand shots that appreciate the vastness of nature, and devastating close-ups for a first-hand point of view. Leone simultaneously puts both styles to practice, and with electrifying results. Yes it's long, but there's a passion within this story that deserves to be told. And like all great filmmakers, Leone doesn't simply tell us. He shows us.Long before his Oscar-winning days, Clint Eastwood ('The Good') reminded us what a simple facial expression can do. With Leone's personal close-ups that allow us to see every bit of his sun-blistered face, Eastwood skillfully leads 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly' with that piercing gaze that's both menacing and pure. Eli Wallach's ('The Ugly') performance is just as good, if not better. Bringing a fierce two-headedness to his character, you're never quite sure what direction he's going to run with. It ups the suspense, adds to the fascination. The characters here aren't merely cardboard cut-outs, but complex and unpredictable people with different motives and different intentions. And when they're all together, expect fireworks.But above the actors, more powerful than the scenery, there is one who reigns supreme. Ennio Morricone's haunting score is one of the single-most recognizable products in cinematic history, and it gives 'The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly' a bite that would be sorely missing otherwise. Absolutely brilliant, it makes Leone's picture an unforgettable experience that captivates us, 3-hour running time and all. A sprawling Civil War era epic that takes its ideas about money and greed and power and betrayal and friendship and intertwines them all together in a cool, collected piece of work. An improbable masterpiece of sorts, but a profoundly rich one that deserves to be seen in all its intended beauty.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Stunning and Timeless Masterpiece", "date": "2008-07-17T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1912487", "sentiment score": [0.0334, 0.078, 0.1474, 0.4028, 0.3383]}, {"content": "i had the movie with me for real long time because it was rated 4 in top 250.. but never watched it till three hours back... so here is my comment. as soon as the movie starts you wonder is this really made in 1967...!!??! the photography of the movie was picture perfect (considering the technology of those times.. hats off)... the movie is super long, over long, lengthy whatever u call.. but something keeps you stick on to the screenplay.. let it be the performances, the photography, the narration, and most importantly the music.. i bet everyone with ears must have listened to this movie's theme somewhere... i thought it would be a boring one... but seriously... the movie steadily picks its pace.. and u just have to cross the first thirty minutes and get into the groove and let the time just fly... its a cinema masterpiece and a must watch.. but just make sure to have 3 uninterrupted hours with you...", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "there is something really special", "date": "2008-07-14T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1910279", "sentiment score": [0.0896, 0.311, 0.3186, 0.2125, 0.0683]}, {"content": "This is the colossal story of three men. Two of which are bounty hunters who are at opposite ends of the moral compass, with one (Angel eyes) who will kill anyone and anything in order to reach his goal and with the other (Blondie) with limits that make him desire the right outcome, even of he sometimes doesn't get it. The third member of this triumvirate is a criminal (Tuco) who will do anything to remain free.As Tuco teams up with the Blondie in order to perform a bounty collecting scam, a missing treasure to pay soldiers in the civil war has been uncovered by Angel eyes, as the film progresses the final piece of the puzzle of the treasure's location is revealed to Tuco and Blondie. The remainder of the film sees the two of them split, team up with other people, intervene in a major civil war battle and have a final reckoning where only one can be the winner.This is a colossal film in terms of its vision and scope. The running time at 161 minutes is a tad long and the film is at its best after the first 40 minutes when the pace is a trifle slow. It is only when the treasure's location is revealed that the film really starts to move and we feel the scale of the vision being revealed. The characters are excellently drawn and each of the three men are interesting and even likable in their own ways. Angel Eyes as the villain is a magnificent one and he is great to watch as he sneers over the screen. Clint is magnificent here and around this time with both this, and Dirty Harry, he has a couple of his best ever performances. Eli Wallach doing a sterling job representing the worsts aspects of greed and selfishness of humanity, however, even within this vessel of degradation there are still redeeming features that he attempts to hide.Directing such a colossal work must have been a nightmare and Sergeo Leone does an incredible job of combining the disparate strands without losing track and, largely, doing so while moving the story forward. The musical score is impressive and during the quieter moments is at its most effective, as, for me, I find the larger pieces too invasive and take over scenes rather than compliment them, and for this and the issue of pace at the beginning marks this down for me, but then again it is a question of taste.Nuff said Em", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Yet another flawed classic", "date": "2008-07-12T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1909281", "sentiment score": [0.0158, 0.1181, 0.376, 0.4365, 0.0535]}, {"content": "If this isn't the Greatest WEstern movie of all time,, someone please tell me what is.. yeah there's a few that come close,, like High Plains Drifter,, and such,, but this film is timeless, i could never grown old watching this one,, and if there ever is a remake,, you better you're Fistful of Dollars,, i'll never watch it.. it would be a travesty to the genre.

Ever wonder why this movie is rated an average of 9.0, and is ranked #4 on IMDb's all-time Top 250? It's over 40 years old, and it's still a stunning movie.I noticed some people on the forums wondering the ages of the people who enjoyed this movie, well I'm 23 and I've just seen it for the first time. I've heard my dad talk about it before, but never being a huge fan of westerns as him, I hadn't really gone out of my way to check it out, until recently. And what an adventure I had. What I enjoyed most about The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly was the gritty realism and attention to every detail. This is really top notch directing by Mr.Leone. Every person, and I do mean EVERY person was very cautious and wily, just like it was back in the Old West. Good, honest people don't live very long, if such people even existed back then. It's just brilliant. The music and sound effects are great as well.Clint Eastwood's Blondie character will be memorable no doubt, but IMO it's Eli Wallach who completely steals the show with his character, the sidekick, Tuco. If there were Oscars back then he should have nailed it without a doubt. Unbelievable acting, and further helped that Tuco had some of the best lines in the movie. I also loved the church scene where, in a span of about 5-8 minutes of character development, it showed that Tuco also had a good, sensitive side despite being a rascal. That was very touching and as I've said many times, just a work of ART. There are many more memorable scenes that I will remember forever: Tuco getting angry and yelling \"you bastid! you SOB!\" Blondie lighting a match with his thumb like a lighter you pig! at the last scene after Blondie shoots Angel Eyes, Tuco tries to finish him off but his gun goes click-click-click! the many times Tuco crossing himself (those that come in by the door *cross*) Blondie lighting the cannon with his cigar, great prank!

It's funny, sad, brutal, intelligent and everything that a movie could ever want, or hope, to be.The directing: Every camera angle seems perfect. The camera catches emotions in extreme closeups, and shows the startling beauty of the landscape in huge panning shots. It's the perfect mix of Closeups, and landscape shots. The camera never seems to be in the wrong place, and ever movement is exciting and stylish.The plot: This movie isn't very plot based, and Sergio seems to be more interested in how the characters react to situations, instead of being interested in those actual situations. Yet this doesn't hurt the movie one bit. In fact, it frees up the plot, and allows the viewer to fully enjoy the movie's style without being hampered with the plot. Occationally, Sergio indulges himself in a few side plots that maybe break the pace a tiny bit, but generally work with everything. To take those out would seriously diminish with the beauty of the film. The plot is atypical for western movies, but you don't really worry about it being cheese or not because the movie doesn't dwell on plot points.The characters and acting: The good (clint Eastwood) is a flawed bounty hunter. There is a certain irony in his performance, as even \"the good\" is imperfect. Eastwood's Man with No Name performance is incredible, and he manages to be cool and slick in any situation. The bad (lee van chleef) is brilliant character because he makes the other two seem like little floating angels. Angel eyes is heartless, and the epitome of pure evil. The ugly (eli wallach) is immoral and disgusting, but strangely likable. Eli Wallach gives a brilliant performance, that sometimes threatens to outshine the other actors (this never happens though).The music: There are not enough good words in the world to describe the music.

Clint Eastwood is Blondie, a mercenary gunman who partners up with the Mexican bandit Tucco (Eli Wallach) to play a con on several different western towns. Tucco plays the part of captured bandit, Blondie the part of bounty hunter who has captured the wanted criminal. Subsequently he collects the reward, and Tucco is to be hung. But being a con, naturally Blondie just shoots Tuccon down off the hangman's rope, and into the sunset they ride to their next con job. Into the fray rides Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef playing the role to menacing perfection), a ruthless killer on the trail of the stolen gold after two of the thieves turn on each other, both hiring Angel Eyes to murder the other. He may be a ruthless killer, but he does have a perverted sense of honor, and thus fulfills both contracts, but not before one of the men tells him the story of the stolen gold, and whom he should seek out to get it, another thief in on the heist, who has now joined up with the Confederate army. As the broad backdrop of the Civil War rages on, we are given a microcosm of the conflict with not two, but three competing sides. What's interesting here is the dichotomy of the characters being almost mirror images of one another. Each a skilled gunman, and proficient killer. However, what separates the three is the degree of morality each has; Blondie killing only when necessary, when he's confronted with no other choice. Tucco kills for convenience, his life of crime has made him many enemies, so he's often faced with the end result, those out for revenge. But Tucco has a softer side, and we see several revelations about his upbringing that place him in a somewhat more heroic light than he first comes across as. Finally, there's Angel Eyes, a demonic killer with no empathy, sympathy or moral direction. He's out to get everything in life for himself, and will sell out anyone that tries to stop him. He delights in torture, but seldom sullies his own hands. He prefers to let others do the dirty work, and enjoys the spoils. I really think he's a representation of the Devil. Someone that enjoys manipulating, killing and causing chaos. A being totally involved with the pleasures of life regardless of the cost to others.

You know what you are? Just the greatest son-of-a-b-! Sergio Leone was a director of boundless vision and ambition, a man with no little ideas. Everything you see is big, and ambitious. In a film that runs about 180 minutes... One could argue that Leone tells the story more with pictures than in words.Thus is The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. A story of three men who are all after the same fortune of Civil War gold. In fact, the secret of its location is spread out among them (one knows the cemetery but not the grave, and the other knows the name but not the cemetery). The men involved are Clint Eastwood ( The Good), Lee Van Cleef ( the Bad) and Eli Wallach ( the Ugly). Each man knows that they will remain alive until the grave is found.....but just as it always is- it is more than likely that each of them will try to kill the others for the gold.They are also men who really never need to explain anything, their eyes and actions could simply be deemed more important than their words. ( The obsession in Van Cleef's eyes) Though, Eastwood's character. Blondie. ( The Man With No Name) says very little, Eli Wallach's: Tuco never stops.In fact, some of the best dialgue from the film is of Wallach's 'speeches' about the differences between people. 'You can be one thing or you can be another.' He compares himself to Blondie, and to his own brother, who became a priest. However...... Blondie has the last word! Though there is no shortage of ideas in the film, there is also a film within a film. Thus, a grand Civil War sequence. One of the best scenes from the film is a scene in which a Union Army Captain ( Aldo Giuffre) explains the war to the best of his ability. The commander who has the most booze to get his troops drunk before the battle is the one who wins. However, probably my favorite scene from the film was the haunting runaway wagon scene.

And this was the best.That I so enjoyed this movie so much came as a shock to me. I literally never before have been able to even sit through a western, which (in my admittedly limited experience) was schlock action starring John Wayne as the taciturn all-American good guy being tough and beating up the outlaws. Watching GBU, I was enthralled for the entire three hours. Twice. And if I had time, I would have watched it a third time. The setting is typically western: a dry, dusty panorama in which men barely co-exist with each other; few wasted words; and lots of action, horses, and gunfighting in a wild west barely governed by incipient institutions of law & order \u0096 all shrouded within a morality play of good vs. bad. But what I liked so much is exactly what I hate about John Wayne westerns \u0096 the seriousness and honesty with which moral context is considered. In Hollywood, good vs. bad is as thoughtlessly superscripted as the protagonists' white and black hats. In GBU every remnant of moralizing has been ruthlessly cut.Good, Bad, and Ugly are personified in the form of three characters: Bad (\"Sentenza\") is the easiest to understand. He is *very* bad, perhaps not so different from other villains, but much more sharply developed; murderous, sadistic, traitorous, and remorseless. Good (\"Blondie\") and Ugly (\"Tuco\") are more puzzling, but their labels are the key to the movie. Both Blondie and Tuco are outlaws and killers with only the barest hint of morality, but they're not evil in the same way that Sentenza is. Tuco is demonstrative, emotional, loud, wild, and unpredictable; but driven by survival rather than satanic urges. Blondie is cool, calm, rational and controlled \u0096 in many ways similar to Sentenza \u0096 but whereas Sentenza tortures, maims, kills, and lies for the hell of it, even apparently enjoys it, Blondie simply goes about his business coolly, and shows several poignant hints of empathy, decency, and a sense of justice.GBU takes place during the Civil War and strips away the high-level political struggle of history books, leaving us with the soldier's vantage point of brutality, pointless death, and some individual decency. The politics are indecipherable from this vantage point. GBU hits this point home when our protagonists wind up in a prison camp because the oncoming gray cavalry uniforms turn out to be dust-covered blue. Later, they encounter an army fighting over a worthless bridge, suffering countless pointless deaths and casualties. Because Leone has so rigorously excised traditional off-the-shelf morality, the few instances of humanity are remarkably poignant. One such instance is when Blondie shares his coat and cigar with a dying soldier; another is when prisoners are forced \u0096 by Sentenza's orders \u0096 to play music to cover up the screams of the tortured. Sentenza apparently enjoyed the irony of beautiful sounds used for such ends; the musicians are, of course, pained by it.That was one of many extraordinarily striking scenes. The honesty of the moral context was what I liked best about the film, but I liked everything else too. Indeed the same primal, ruthless honesty that characterizes the character development pervades the film. The music is unlike anything I'd ever heard \u0096 it's an audible version of the arid west and the tensions and lawlessness that characterize the film. Underlying the entire score is one instantly memorable theme starting off with what sounds like a screaming hyena. The story took place in New Mexico, and even though it was filmed in Spain, it really does look like New Mexico; and just as in life in the American west, the wide, breathtaking panorama tends to subordinates dialog. Indeed, it is several minutes into the film before even one word is spoken.The plot was extremely clever \u0096 and never predictable. High level suspense is maintained for the full three hours. It was hard to imagine how it could unfold \u0096 three uncompromising outlaws in search of one buried treasure; cooperation was not in their nature, but nothing was ever done out of character. Any Western clich\u00e9 that you can think of is either given a unique twist or destroyed by masterful storytelling. For example there is an utterly irreverent scene in which Tuco meets his brother, a sincere Priest, and turns platitudes upside down. The brother begins with the standard rebuke of the criminal's behavior, but Tuco punches back and says, \"Where we come from there were only two ways out. You lacked the courage to do what I've done.\" The movie is also irreverently funny: For example, Twice Tuco gained the upper hand on Blondie and said:\"There are two kinds of spurs(?), my friend. Those that come in by the door, and (crosses himself) those that come in by the window.\"\"There are two kinds of people in the world, my friend. Those who have a rope around their neck and those who have the job of cutting.\" Later Blondie gained the advantage of Tuco and observed: \"You see in this world there's two kinds of people my friend - those with loaded guns, and those who dig. You dig.\" In addition to all these specific attributes, a unique and strikingly cool style infuses the entire film: long scenes of tense silences \u0096 never for an instant boring; and telling, startling close-ups and transitions. Most noteworthy was the film's climax. As the protagonists stand there with their fingers on their holsters, waiting for the first person to go for their gun(s), the transitions start out slowly, and speed up as the tension increases. As I write this, I wish I had my own copy of the film, just so I could see this scene again.Not just a great western, but easily one of the best movies of *any* kind ever made.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 180, "votes": 195}, "heading": "Primal honesty and morality", "date": "2007-12-26T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1786943", "sentiment score": [0.0402, 0.0896, 0.0825, 0.3026, 0.485]}, {"content": "I must admit that I had some doubts prior to seeing this movie, considering its length and some people's comments that it is slow as molasses. Well, they were mostly right about that. GB & U is indeed a movie that does not always move very fast, and it does take a little getting used to. Yet if you manage to look past the slowness, this is easily one of the best movies ever made.This is one of those movies where nearly everything comes together in exactly the right way. First of all, there is a wonderful cast of characters. Clint Eastwood is at his best as the 'Good' (even though he's not strictly a good guy but more a bad guy with an honor code), Lee van Cleef is so truly evil that you'll long for his downfall with a passion, and Eli Wallach steals the show as the 'Ugly', turning him into a character that you'll root for even though he's quite clearly the least trustworthy character you'll ever meet.These wonderful characters engage in a quite complex plot full of twists and turns, as they are constantly trying to outwit and outshoot each other. There's quite a lot going on and in spite of the fact that the tone of the movie is actually fairly light (there is some truly good humor), it's actually a fairly good exploration of human nature and the lengths to which people will go to achieve their goals.And then, there's the music of course. Ennio Morricone has always composed some very distinct and recognizable tunes, which unfortunately were not always that great by themselves. The music here, however, is absolutely one of the most memorable scores ever.Of course, the cinematography is wonderful as well. The production values here seem to be a lot higher than in some previous Leone movies, and GB & U contains plenty of memorable shootouts that will truly keep you on the edge of your seat. At the same time, the gunmen here seem not nearly as invincible as in some other Leone movies, which greatly adds to the suspense.As I said before, nearly everything comes together in this movie. Sure, it might be a bit slow, but it's got a great story of good versus evil, told in an impressive and truly epic way, with memorable characters and shootouts everywhere.

That was a period when film still held onto its artistic impulse, when the modern day blockbuster, complete with stunning visual effects, mind-bogglingly fast action sequences, and miraculously thin story lines and characterisations was still in its infancy. Over time, as some nostalgic folk of the 'then' would say, 'the world has become too fast, and kids today don't give a damn about deeper stuff'. Indeed it has; through the development of film over the decades, we see - at least a glimpse of - this seemingly reductive summarisation of the vast social and cultural changes in the world. The legendary final scene of this film, where the three principal characters face, is roughly about five minutes long, from the time they implicitly agree to this 'solution' to the first 'bang' of Eastwood's pistol. In these five minutes, Leone uses music and recurring shots of the men to create the tension, engineering a sense of finality and fatality in the situation that could quite possibly take all their lives. At that critical moment, greater importance is given to this all-encompassing tension, where the entire film's plot and the journey must culminate in a decisive end, than to the eventual outcome, which would be revealed in all eventuality. As audience, Leone wants us to participate in this tension, to completely transport ourselves into the simmering, immoral West, and feel the presence of death as the characters do, and therefore to achieve a cinematic orgasm that involves both the intellectual and visceral, in turn immortalising it. This painstaking attention to detail, the need to go beyond the bare plot and action, and the urge to create a cinematic environment that transcends, is something that we see too little of today. Indeed, we are privy to this intellectual desire from the very start. The first shot in the film, of the brusque, brutally masculine face of a minor character (who returns later) that somehow eerily seems directly born out of the harshness of the desert is wonderful example of heightened realism that epitomised films of that time. We can almost smell and feel the sweat on the man's face; we can delve into his eyes, into his soul, and through it, witness the moral degradation that Leone wants us to observe. This film could easily have been given a title, with something to the effect of earning some 'dollars', as are the other two in the trilogy, but Leone decides to punctuate it with an exposition on morality with the title he gives it. As any discerning viewer would infer, it is dichotomous to the nature of the pertinent characters. All three are 'ugly', and Leone tries of remind us with his concluding piece that morality is a vague, invariably overlapping concept that is too often oversimplified. Using the west as a setting, we realise that people are too complex, too evil to start with, and any attempt to glorify one is to shun this gruesome reality. This perfectly explains the unique collection of faces in the film, with are all polished with the desert's sweat that makes them impenetrable to scrutiny of any kind. The three adjectives that form the title function almost completely on one side of the moral boundary. And yet, no one can call the film entirely immoral or fatalistic, for we witness traces of humanity in the most absurd of circumstances. Blondie offering a cigar to a dying soldier and providing him warmth is once example of this. Understanding this moral equation, we can then justify the labels given to the three protagonists. Unlike the other two, Blondie keeps his sadistic impulses to a minimum. Also, he tellingly suggests the method of resolution to decide the recipient of the money which leads to the final confrontation scene. Most notably though, he underlines his seeming sense of fairness by taking his rightful share of the money, albeit making it impossible for Tuco to collect his. Unlike him, Angel Eyes shows no pretence of such selflessness, and is perfectly willing to brutalise Tuco (another chilling scene) to get the secret out of him. However, even he believes in simply completing his job, and would not resort to perfidy that Tuco is culpable of, making him the 'ugly' version of humanity. As we see, all three differ from one another only in degree, unlike the ironic suggestion of the title.Overall, this is a complete auteur's film, where Leone underscores memorable action sequences with great atmospheric detail and an underlying message that is so finely sewed beneath the more palpable layers that most of us tend to overlook it completely. This may not be the pinnacle of artistic cinema of 'that' time, but it reflects the sophistication a film can manifest beneath the superficial layers. Its slowly unraveling scenes and attention to detail is reminder to all of us to stop, and sometimes look at life with a keener eye, instead of being constantly pre-occupied with our daily, routine existence.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "The old, gritty West and life in general", "date": "2007-12-17T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1781988", "sentiment score": [0.0251, 0.0597, 0.0943, 0.44, 0.3809]}, {"content": "Upon release of this movie the critics were not so mild with there comments, but this is in my opinion the best western ever made!

I will try to give depth to why I give this movie a 7/10. The cinematography is spectacular; this movie really does contain some of the best shots I have and ever will see in a movie. The length does not bother me, although there are certainly a few scenes that could have been cut down like the final showdown or some of the Civil War scenes. Now the plot. And here arrives the main problem. Historically and contextually, almost all the weapons and battle scenes are out of their time and place in history. I'm sorry, but I can't award a movie a 10/10 for messing up so many basic historical facts. Besides that, there are scenes that just don't mesh well, and I believe the film is somewhat poor on its pacing such as the scene in the monastery vs. the civil war bridge scene. The acting is decent, but seriously how much depth can any of the actors give with these one sided characters. And here, the next problem arises: The characters themselves have NO depth. One is ugly and greedy, the other is bad and....wicked, the last one is good...and a good shot. There's nothing else about them! At least in some of his other movies like A Fistful of Dollars or Once Upon a Time in the West, all the characters are multi-faceted. Moving right along, the production is fairly decent, but how does it help with so many historical errors? The music......is not that good. I have never understood why so many people think it's amazing. It's very simple and....rather childish to be blunt. Sergio Leone is certainly a qualified and somewhat talented director, but this is not his best movie or even one of his better ones. For a good Leone movie, check out Once Upon a Time in the West.

I much prefer a good psychological Western between complex antagonists, Eastwood's own \"Unforgiven\" would be an example. This was more a straightforward tale of three desperadoes consumed by greed who attempt to outwit each other on the trail to an unknown grave containing two hundred thousand dollars in gold coin. Each though, earns their respective title credit in the story, even if Eastwood's Blondie might be the 'good' simply based on his classically rugged features.More on the plus side, it was really cool to hear the title theme music expressed in a handful of different ways throughout the story. The picture also captured the gritty realism of what the 1860's wild west was probably a lot like.

Then again, theater goers would never make it to the end of the picture - oh well for that idea.As for the film's length, I too side with those that feel it took a long time to get from Point A to Point B. I'm really wondering if it was necessary to bring in the Civil War battle for that bridge, but it did give rise to perhaps the most meaningful scene in the picture for me.

The sense of humor of this film is the key factor. Especially the performance of Eli Wallach is outstanding. For me the best actor ever. On the one side there are great actors (Eli Wallach, Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef) and on the other side there is a remarkable storyline. It's a story about three \"criminals\" who are playing some tricky games during the war between the South States and the North States.

After watching it a second time all i can say is this ... Sergio Leonios Best, Clint Eastwoods best and the best Western of all time. The battle sense's were by far the best and most life like battle sense's i have ever seen , the best thing about this film is the music, that theme composed greatly by Ennio Morrocone has become a modern classic. The Story really came to me this time watching it. Clint Eastwood plays Blondie (THE GOOD), Eli Wallach plays Tuco (THE BAD) and Lee Van Cleff plays Angle Eyes (THE UGLY), three men who are after a fortune in gold. It sounds like a typical story, but to get to the gold they have to go through the civil war. Well, only Blondie and Tuco have too. Angle Eyes is a general in the war. I really don't know what made think this was crap the first time i watched it. I guess it was because at that time, i really didn't like Westerns at all.

However, the two engage in numerous double-crossings against each other, until stumbling across a dying Confederate soldier (Antonio Casale) who gives each man a clue to the location of a hidden cache of gold. Tuco and Blondie re-form their alliance to find the gold, only to find that Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), a ruthless hired gun, is already after the gold. The three men form a frequently-changing series of alliances to get at the gold, and they must avoid the Union and Confederate armies operating in the region.\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" is a landmark film in many respects. Its cultural influence is nigh-impossible to overstate, with its iconic musical score by Ennio Morricone, three memorably amoral protagonists, the close-ups, vast landscapes, and the title itself, all of which are instantly recognizable icons of cinema, having been referenced and replicated time and again in movies, TV shows, and even commercials. It is Sergio Leone's first truly great film, a transition from the low-budget Spaghetti Westerns (\"A Fistful of Dollars\", \"For a Few Dollars More\") to the big budget, artistic epics that Leone would make for the rest of his career (\"Once Upon a Time in the West/America\"). It is also a film of utmost importance to me; after watching this movie as an eleven year old, admiring its wonderfully quirky characters, style, music, and breath-taking cinematography, I realized for the first time that I wanted to devote my life to films, be it watching them, writing on them, or hopefully making them.\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" is a full-blown epic, and one with an interesting subtext. We see three completely amoral characters whose crimes - robbery, murder, and racketeering - are minor compared to the brutal carnage we see the Civil War inflicting. Taking place during the little-known Sibley Campaign in New Mexico, the film is not a documentary depiction of the war, but an allegorical one. This was the first total war, and Leone uses it as a metaphor for conflict in general, with faceless mass slaughter inflicted by rifles, machine guns, and artillery. Blondie, Tuco, and Angel Eyes' transgressions are minor compared to a brutal, Auschwitz-like concentration camp, spies being executed in the streets, towns being shelled, and vicious, stalemated trench warfare over a \"flyspeck\" of a bridge. Even our amoral heroes have amounts of humanity which set them apart from the machine-like slaughter around them; Blondie saves Tuco's life and comforts dying soldiers of both sides; Tuco struggles with a mixture of affection and hatred for Blondie, and his troubled relationship with his brother (Luigi Pistilli), and even Angel Eyes shows disgust at the carnage he sees.The movie is extremely episodic, the plot only secondary to the adventures of these characters. Leone's wonderful direction gives the film a fairy-tale quality, with an appearance of realism while being fanciful and at times almost surreal. The movie contains extremely memorable set pieces: the lengthy opening, with three gunmen going after Tuco; the \"carriage of the spirits\"; the prison camp; a shootout in a town under shellfire; an epic Civil War battle; Tuco running excitedly through the cemetery; and, of course, the unforgettable climactic \"triello\". Tonino Delli Colli's cinematography is simply breath-taking, with desert landscapes as impressive as David Lean's films contrasting with the most extreme close-ups imaginable. Carlo Simi's set designs, from shelled-out towns to prison camps to the cemetery, is breath-taking. And Ennio Morricone's score is, for lack of a better word, one of the most amazing ever written, the instantly recognizable theme tune and other brilliant pieces creating the movie's indescribable atmosphere.The cast creates unforgettably iconic characters. Clint Eastwood is back as the Man With No Name, here much more human in this film despite retaining his cool, detached, shifty nature. Lee Van Cleef, who had played a likable character in Leone's previous film, now plays one of the most memorably evil characters ever. Aldo Giuffre, Antonio Casas, and Luigi Pistilli are effective in supporting roles, and Leone's usual stock cast - Mario Brega, Benito Stefanelli, Al Muloch, Aldo Sambrell, and many others - create their own iconography. But it's Eli Wallach who steals the show, as the scenery chewing Tuco, a shifty, double-crossing, foul-mouthed bandit who manages to be the most likable and human of the cast despite his faults; truly, one of the most memorable film characters ever.\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" is one of the most well-known and influential movies ever made, and with good reason. In terms of style, it is an absolute triumph, being one of the most amazingly made movies ever made. Those only familiar with the movie for its cast, its score, or peripherally through its iconic stature, are missing out on one of the most breath-taking cinematic experiences ever.

You had the classic opening 10 minutes with no dialogue, the clever storyline where each character knows something the other doesn't and the climactic gunfight. One mustn't forget the wonderful Morricone score. There were some problems though that we might not want to face because we love Sergio and Clint, but let's face them just the same shall we? Brutal violence is a trademark of this genre, but here it was done over the line where it was unnecessarily vicious. It worked in Fistful because there was a sort of logic to it whereas here in scenes like the shot through the pillow and the abandoning of Tuco it came off as being just too cruel to justify. Slapping of women and leaving people to hang are tough elements, but ones that had a feel that they belonged.

I watched this film for the first time when I was 13 and I just love it more each time I watch ItIl Buono Il Brutto e Il Cattivo is different from the classic Wayne and Ford Westerns, this movie as all \"Spaghetti Westers\" (called like that because of their Italian Origins and filmmakers like Sergio Leone) They show the darker Uglier and dirtier side of westerns and in my opinion also a more realistic feel to how people really where during the civil war, instead of the usual Twinkle from John Waynes bright teeth, We see three men who are ten times more believable real dirty and gritty. Eli Wallach's superb acting as Tuco (The Ugly) makes him my favorite character in the movie, constantly changing facial expressions based on each situation first he is angry then he is nice, he shows the brutal and greedy side as well as the genuine and caring human side So Thumbs Up Mister Wallach. Clint Eastwood on the other hand is in his usual cool self you see in the other two movies of the No name Trilogy, Very careful on which words he uses as well as not using any words but sending a strong emotion (when he offers his cigar to the wounded man in the broken down house) that cigar makes him unique , apparently Eastwood asked Director Sergio Leone if he could stop using it in some scenes, Leone answered by saying \" If you don't have the cigar, you don't have the same character.\"The Screenplay is very original and leaves a lot of suspense in certain scenes, you never get bored or tired although the movie is pretty long you don't feel time passing by you are just captured by the story and cant wait to see what happens next. Of course this film would be only be half as good if it did not have Ennio Morricone's Fantastic Score which sets a perfect mood to each scene, and I am not surprised to see many songs from this scored used in so many other movies, I am surprised it took so long for the Academy Awards to recognize him by giving him an Oscar.Overall this movie is a must see for Western Lovers and Movie Lovers in general and I am very pleased to see it in IMDb's Top ten Movies.Favorite Quote: \"You see , In this World there are two kinds of people my friend, those with loaded guns and those who dig, You dig!.\"", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 4}, "heading": "Greatest Western of all Time", "date": "2007-03-27T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1625808", "sentiment score": [0.0321, 0.102, 0.2136, 0.3938, 0.2586]}, {"content": "This isn't the worst of the spaghetti films, but it is a terrible films. If you don't know what a spaghetti film is, it means, great exciting music trying to make up for a weak stupid plot, uninteresting, unlikable characters, silly comic book style gunfights, terrible writing, terrible directing, and slow paced boredom. This film isn't a complete bomb because of the efforts of some of the actors. It's no secret that Eastwood wasn't a gifted actor, and he had to be surrounded by superior actors such as Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef. Those two, and the supporting cast almost make this bearable. It involves three men. One is good, one is bad, and one is the guy who took your last girlfriend away from you. But which is which? The film literally has to tell you. Eastwood is supposed to be good, but the only two not completely vicious things he does are try to save a handicapped from hanging (so he can take him to be executed again), and offering a dying soldier a puff from his cigar-not trying to stop his bleeding or even give him some pain killer, but to just do a cigarette commercial in the middle of a movie. There's no reason to care about him at all. In fact, the guy who stole your girlfriend comes across as almost sympathetic (almost.) The plot is the three are after a decent amount of gold. The trouble they go through, they could've much easier just stolen that much cash somewhere is. So the plot is ludicrous. The characters are just an example of that era's movie making in which movie makers tried to outdo each other with evil characters. Billed as anti-heroes, they don't come close to filling that role. True anti-heroes are self absorbed, maybe somewhat selfish, probably anti-social, such as in \"Hombre\", \"The Lost Continent\", and the Edmond O'Brien version of \"DOA\". These guys are just vicious punks who you would not want to be your boss, your law enforcement official, your anything. That said, there is some great music, which doesn't match up at all with the mundane events and characters. The shootout scenes are ridiculous, probably comical, and unfortunately they paved the way for a multitude of later movies that copied these inferior techniques. For exciting shootouts you really need to go way back before these movies, or to more modern movies that know better. This cannot be construed in any way as a good movie, much less a classic.

It's a bloody, emotional, and almost mystical horse opera that can't help but get under your skin and keep you enthralled for three hours. It's cinematic art and commercial dynamite.

One was good, the other bad, the other ugly. Or maybe they all had those three characteristics in them. But they arrived at one hell of a showdown, and it changed things.This is not just an action filled western, but a sweeping commentary on the American character, as witnessed by an objective outsider. His aim was true.By the mid 60s, the western formula, and perhaps the action film itself, had become too stale and conventional to evoke any enthusiastic response. Leone gave us not just a new perspective on film violence, but for the first time a director blended the most fascinating elements of American history, both mythical and real, into a traditional western story.The storyline, involving three untitled men propelled by avarice into uncivilized territory, could serve as a fable for the expansion of the American frontier. Against the sun-blasted background we see the elements that have shaped, in different ways, the essential American character: warfare, technology, weapons, hardened individualism. Previous western films might have explored related themes, but never with the exciting visual style shown in this one.The characters are men we really have never seen before. They are enigmatic, inscrutable, and fascinating to look at. Leone leaves their pasts unmarked so we can eagerly fill in their backgrounds on our own. As their journey in pursuit of lucre ends, we are presented with the best showdown in the history of the western. The quest, exciting as it was, culminates in one of the best endings in movie history.The score of course is famous in itself but welded to the fascinating visuals and characters it becomes one for the ages.

What surprised me most of all was that a long film with quite a slow pace to it actually appeared to move quite quickly; this is thanks to Leone's superior direction and the frequent change of locations within the film. Clint Eastwood's iconic status was firmly established in this film as a bad ass desperado with compulsory cigar attached, Blondie makes Dirty Harry appear meagre in comparison! Whilst the characterisation provided by the supporting cast was over the top to an almost comic book standard, their performances and characters were still memorable and enjoyable as they provided a stark contrast to Eastwood's quiet loner.Where a lot of westerns fall short is the plot, they tend to become a victim of style over substance but this film is an exception as it provides us with a fairly intricate plot. The way Tuco's (Wallach) murderous intentions regarding Blondie are quashed by the fact that Blondie knows the secret of the treasure, leading to Tuco fighting to keep him alive rather than kill him, is very commendable. The tie in with the American civil war is very enjoyable and provides some further tension and heightens the predicament that the main characters are in, especially considering Angle Eyes (Cleef) is a high rank in the Unionist regiment that Eastwood and Wallach have infiltrated. The tension is built up fairly well, even though it requires patience. The final stand off, for instance, takes a matter of minutes for the main characters to get in their positions with the camera ranging from extreme close ups to the characters' eyes to shots that appear to be a mile away. Whilst this sounds potentially frustrating, it induces overwhelming anticipation and once again, the music comes in to play, setting up a true piece of cinematic history.Whilst there are no award winning performances on show, the leads are very good. Eastwood played greatly on his tough guy image and manages to tell us a lot about the character despite not saying much. Eastwood illustrates fantastically, a character devoid of trust and sentiment but also a character of great honour. It is plain to see that Blondie is world weary and he knows that it's kill or be killed. Eli Wallach is very good, probably the best performance in the film. His animated performance brings his character to life as a thoroughly dislikeable loudmouth who is too stupid to avoid trouble but greedy enough not to let his desire to kill Blondie stopping him get the treasure. Lee Van Cleef is even more dislikeable because where Wallach's Tuco is untrustworthy, Cleef's Angel Eyes is brutally honest with ruthlessness to match. The interrogation scenes in the Union camp really highlight this nature and makes sure that the audience knows he means business. The best thing about these characters is that they all flawed, it's not all black and white. Even Eastwood's 'The Good' is not all that good.Laced with brilliant set pieces and memorable performances, The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is very memorable and definitely a classic. Watching Wallach hunt Eastwood with his cigar stubs proves the film had a sense of humour but that didn't take away the fact that the film depicts a life of brutality where not even women and children are safe when they stand between power hungry men and their goal.

Earthy, gritty, moody, rambling, funny and just plain nasty too. One thing most people forget about the Sergio Leone Dollar trilogy films is that they were made when westerns were really staid and boring, with zero atmosphere and very mechanical. Then came these movies, with THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY being the last and the greatest of the three Dollar films. Cinema wasn't the same after it was released. And to show influential this film is, it transcended its \"western\" genre and influenced practically every type of films made after that. Heck, I'm not even a western fan and I thoroughly admire what Leone and the gang created here. It's big, bold, melancholic, lusty, giddy and operatic.The thing I really love about THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is the atmosphere. It's almost one kind. Never duplicated in any other film since (and that includes Clint Eastwood's dry cowboy flicks). One major contributing factor is obviously Ennio Morricone's unforgettable score, probably one of the greatest scores ever made. The music during the ending, when Tuco searches the cemetery, it's spine tinglingly powerful.Of the three characters, Tuco steals the show. He's the heart and soul of film. It's probably Eli Wallach's greatest performance. He immersed himself in the role and, in the processed, really became Tuco.My only complaint about THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is that it is a low budget film and as expansive and epic as it is, the film sorta looks cheap. Practically everything was shot outside. There are few sets in the movie and when we are within four walls, the sets look, hmm, cheap. I just wished the production design was as expansive looking as the vision Leone had in mind. The film would have been perfect then. But that's something I can clearly overlook.When I watch a movie like THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY, I get depressed. Depressed because at one time films were actually amazing, groundbreaking and entertaining. The 1960s were one of the greatest era in movie-making.

Let me focus on a few sides I haven't read about. The first one is philosophy. Movies, which aspire to be philosophical usually are boring and pompous. Probably Leone did not have such ambitions. Still philosophy - together with myth and religion, as pointed out by others - plays an important role. Since the antique times of the Greeks and Romans philosophers ask themselves the question: how can one lead a virtuous life in difficult circumstances? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is Leone's answer. There is no doubt about the Bad (Lee van Cleef). His name Angel Eyes must refer to the Fallen Angel, as he represents Evil. I don't know Italian, but I would not be surprised if the correct translation of Il Brutto should have been the Hypocrite. Tuco's (Eli Wallach) ways are ugly, only doing good when it is in his own interest. But what about the Good (Clint Eastwood)? His name, Blondie, refers to medieval characters like the Lady in the Tower with the Golden Hair, or Siegfried from the Nibelungen saga. Blondie certainly does not represent good the way all religions would like to see it. He is cynical, mean, ruthless, violent. He only shows compassion when he can afford it. I think the final scene of the movie gives the answer: in a lawless world being virtuous means being in a position of power and then apply a rudimentary kind of justice. Can anyone assume, that Tuco will have nice memories of Blondie? We can turn this argument around. If Blondie is good, what kind of world is he living in? I guess, we all must be grateful to live in an orderly society and not in a free for all.Wagner developed the concept of Gesamtkunst, something like Total Art, for opera. He meant, that every element of the project should cooperate in harmony to achieve the final result. Leone has realised this concept with his GBU. Read the other reviews: every single detail contributes to the movie. The close ups already have been mentioned many times. They demand superb underacting, as we must read the emotions of the characters by small changes in their facial expressions.Luigi Pistilli as the monk and Tuco's brother deserves to be mentioned especially. He is the voice of religious morals and gives us a ray of hope in a very dark world. Pistilli is excellent, like in For a few dollars more and Death rides a horse.Still GBU is not the best movie ever imo. I'd like to mention Seven Samurai (Kurosawa), Le clan des Siciliens (Verneuil), Le samourai (Melville), A clockwork orange (Kubrick), Monsieur Klein (Losey), Autumn Sonata (Bergmann) and La dentilliere (Goretta). Note that three of these see Alain Delon; I think there are several similarities with Clint Eastwood. You will probably ask: how can you compare? You are right, it's just my personal taste. GBU still falls in the categorie extra-ordinaire, with the aforementioned movies and titles like Lola (Fassbinder), Vertigo (Hitchcock), Smiles of a Summer night (Bergmann)and For a few dollars more (Leone).

There are two kinds of filling 3 hours: Long, stylish scenes and lots of twists in the plot. This movie here has both.After watching it, I felt like I was on a roller-coaster. So much happens throughout, it is hard to remember every last bit of it, which doesn't mean you wouldn't feel it. I'm always in fever when Tuco runs around on the cemetery, with Morricone's unique music in the back. A truly haunting moment.It was a smart way Leone let Blondie develop. He's starting of as a great gunfighter and always shows a little bit of different sides coming up on his harsh surface. And in the end, he gets his poncho. What a moment! And it makes sense. After having seen all this, it is clear, why he is so cool in the other two DOLLARS: This one here was just way much more of a challenge.Lee van Cleef does a terrific job, especially after having played the hard but good colonel in the movie before. It shows some great quality as an actor to create so much sympathy in one movie and so much horror in the next.Eli Wallach brings up a character, you can compare with Jack Sparrow. You never know, what he really is up to, but everything he does is a circus and you love to watch him being the greedy underdog of this trio.The plot is the greatest quality in this movie, if you ask me. So many twists, settings, side characters and events are unique in the western genre, probably in every one.It is impressive to compare ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST and THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY. Since Leone was forced by the studio to make ONCE UPON according to the great success of the first three western movies, it is surprising that he didn't produce another one of his \"Nameless\" tales but the epic itself within the westerns. When you don't know that, you could easily think the two movies were shot by different directors. I like ONCE UPON better, just because I felt more emotions watching it.But still, THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is a terrific achievement. They had almost ten different languages being spoken on the set. The bridge was first blown to ribbons accidentally with no camera rolling. Eastwood and Leone had their conflicts. Leone couldn't speak more English than \"Look\" and act what he wanted.

The Good The Bad The Ugly is one of these films. When I first saw it I thought it was rather slow but still memorable. The second time I watched it it didn't feel slow at all, and I found myself more impressed with it.The movie revolves around three gunmen looking for a fortune of gold hidden in a cemetery during the Civil War. Clint Eastwood plays Blondie (The Good)a guy who though not really good, has probably the most morals of the three and a sense of honor. Eli Wallach plays Toco, (The Ugly). He is a man looking out for himself and nobody else, but I never got the sense that he was totally evil. Selfish and distrustful but not outright bad. That's probably why Toco is the most beloved of the three. He also gives the best performance in the movie. Then we have Lee Van Cleef who stars as Angel Eyes (The Bad). His character name is totally misleading because he is the most outright evil of all three.Each of these characters knows a bit of information about the gold, and so they have to rely on each other to find the location. Of course neither one is inclined to share. So this all leads to an ending which boasts one the best showdowns in any cowboy western.Though the story is mainly about these three characters, director Sergio Leone never lets us forget about the horrors involved with war. Even though these three men are hunting for treasure, the war surrounding them as they make their way is shown in good detail to remind us what it might have been like back in those times. It is definitely a great movie.On top of all this, Sergio Leone is an expert with the camera. He uses close up shots of character's facial features where we see every tick and expression, but he is also able to expand out and give us panoramic views of the land surrounding these people. The opening scenes were excellent, as were so many more that followed. Great characters, great pacing, and incredible gun fights with sweeping views of the country make this western one of the best ever.

With the Good, the Bad and the Ugly he continued his upward trajectory and rounded off his dollars trilogy in style.This picture was Leone's most stylised and grandiose to date, and brought all the themes and styles he had been developing in his earliest films to perfection. Among the most notable was his characterisation, particularly his all-important introductions of characters. Look at the introductory scenes of the three leads. We first see Tuco bursting out of a window, obviously interrupted in the middle of a meal, and straight away we get his freeze-frame and the title \"the ugly\" \u0096 this is a simple character, and needs no further introduction. Angeleyes appears out of the distance, but grows towards us until his face fills the screen. We see him commit two despicable acts of murder and treachery before we get his freeze-frame and title \"the bad\", telling us he is pure evil. Finally, in Blondie's first appearance he steps into the frame from behind the camera, as if he had always been there. He rescues Tuco, but only for his own profit. It's not until we have seen him betray and abandon Tuco that we get his freeze-frame and title \"the good\" \u0096 obviously a fairly ironic label given the way he has just acted.Leone's trademark long drawn out face-offs \u0096 exaggerated versions of the shootouts of John Ford westerns and the sword duels of Kurosawa's samurai films \u0096 are also brought to a peak here. Not only are they now taken to absurd heights of stylisation, they are also spread out and adapted to cover the whole picture, until the point where even two men sitting opposite each other eating a meal and glancing suspiciously at one another is treated like another stand off. In fact, the entire film can be considered one long series of duels.We also see more of the importance Leone attaches to church and family. The Dollars trilogy could be thought to lack emotion, taking place as it does in a world where there are no morals and everyone is out for gold. However the Good, the Bad and the Ugly contains several moments of poignancy, perhaps the most prominent of which is when Tuco confronts his estranged priest brother.Religious iconography and references crops up time and again. Leone loved biblical epics almost as much as he loved westerns, and there is something of the feel of those pictures here in the overwhelming landscapes and eerie, choral music. On top of this the central trio can be read as an allegory for God, the Devil and humanity. This arguably presents rather a cynical view of the Catholic faith \u0096 given the treacherous and chequered nature of the \"good\" \u0096 but it could be argued to be a typically Italian one. In a country in which the church is so omnipresent and universally accepted, it's sometimes said that God is cursed as much as loved. Having said that, this was clearly never intended as the central theme \u0096 Leone wasn't trying to make some grand statement here \u0096 it's simply part of the mix of ideas going on in this picture.This brings me onto the war theme. Anti-war sentiments are not directly addressed in this picture, but the way the civil war is woven into the plot makes a powerful statement. For the first half hour we don't see that the war is going on. The central characters aren't concerned with the it \u0096 they are only interested in hunting down the gold. However the war encroaches on the plot more and more often, until it moves from background to foreground and takes over the entire picture, culminating in a colossal battle scene. And of course the fact that the film ends in a huge military graveyard is also very significant.I've spent so long talking about the themes and ideas going on in this film I've nearly run out of space to talk about all the genius that has gone into making it so enjoyable. The dialogue is superb, often funny and plenty of it quotable. Technically Leone has perfected his art \u0096 he composes a shot like John Ford, edits like Eisenstein, paces like Kurosawa, but all with a degree of his own originality. There is brilliant acting \u0096 Eli Wallach steals it as Tuco, probably his best ever performance. It's funny how Lee Van Cleef was cast as a villain here. Van Cleef's early career mostly involved playing mean-looking gang members, but as Leone discovered when casting him as the hero in For a Few Dollars More, while his face said \"bad guy\" his voice and manner could be warm and likable. The good guy Van Cleef obviously proved more popular, as in the dozen or so other spaghetti westerns he made for other directors he was invariably cast as the hero.Just time for a final word on the recent (2003) restored edition. While it's great that several lost scenes have been added, I have to say that very few of them were entirely necessary. The only one of the added scenes I really like is the one in which Angeleyes visits the field hospital \u0096 it keeps his story arc going, and also shows an act of compassion from the \"bad\" when he lets the soldier keep the bottle. However the new dubbing for these scenes, strange as it may seem considering today's technology, is mixed absolutely atrociously. On top of this, Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach are now so elderly, they actually sound less convincing than the guy impersonating the late Lee Van Cleef. As a result the restored segments stick out like sore thumbs, and break up the flow of what is in every other way a perfect motion picture.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 47, "votes": 53}, "heading": "\"There are two kinds of people in this world, my friend\"", "date": "2006-11-25T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1529508", "sentiment score": [0.0181, 0.0636, 0.1424, 0.5241, 0.2517]}, {"content": "This has got to be without out a doubt my favorite western of all time, also one of my personal favorites all time.

In my opinion this is just a watchable and good western, but not much more than that.I think the only possible explanation would be that IMDb reviewers consider \"spaghetti\" westerns a sub-genre within the western genre. If that is so, \"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly\" would probably stand among the best (if not the best)in the \"spaghetti\" westerns ranking. But the point is that in my opinion there are no sub-genres within the western genre. So I analyze this film just for what it is: a western film.In such terms, this film has its moments, fine open-wide outdoor locations, good action gunfights (though hardly believable) and an acceptable plot. Good acting too mainly in Eli Wallach's Tuco.But what really demerits this movie is its incredibly unnecessary overrun; there's no way the story can stand almost 3 hours in duration and so the development is definitely slow. Overruning has always been a characteristic of director Sergio Leone; he sort of engages madly with some sequences and he goes on and on and on at it (the final duel here is an example with all those unnecessary close shots in the men's faces and eyes). Another clear sample of what I'm saying was the incredibly long -and even boring- opening sequence of \"Once Upon a Time in the West\", where Leone takes more than 10 minutes in the opening sequence where three gunmen are waiting for Charles Bronson at a train station.Come on guys, let's face it. \"Spaghetti\" westerns are \"B\" movies and even if at the very start they could have seemed sort of original and somehow enjoyable, once you take an honest critical look at them they're not great films but just good a few of them but no more than that.

However, after I have seen this, Leone instantly became one of my favorite directors. Leone has a distinct style in his films and this movie pulls it out 150%.The cinematography in this film is incredible. His use of extreme long shots and extreme close ups are unsurpassed. The film opens with the close up of a man with an expressionless face creating a sense of mystery and excitement. What will this guy going to do? What's going to happen? Then we are introduced to two new unknown men and the three walk towards the entrance. Silence. Then suddenly, the 3 bust in, guns are shot and Tuco busts through the window and escapes with a half eaten chicken (or pork) leg. One of the men is injured, tries to make a futile final attempt to kill him and falls to the floor; the other 2 are already dead. Just in that one scene, we are introduced to Tuco and can already guess his character, his background info, and skill... without a single spoken line of dialogue.As a matter of fact, nobody speaks until about 10 minutes into the film. It is all visual. We, the audience, are forced to imagine what the characters are thinking, what might be taking place. Leone gives the viewers a chance to guess what might happen. Even in Once Upon a Time in the West, we see his mastery at the No-Dialogue introduction. I also believe that this is his way to introduce the character's personality traits without the viewers actually knowing that they know it. A subtle technique so when they see a character do something later in the movie, the viewers can accept the character's actions.However, Leone would not be as great as he is if it wasn't for his partner Ennio Morricone and his unique and memorable soundtrack. The coyote-like music sets the mood for this film like no other western. It is something you must listen to and experience it to retain the full appreciation of it, and know why it has become the trademark music for the western genre.These techniques go on throughout the film and bring us to the ultimate scene in film history, where Leone's style shines to it's full extent. His incredible use of long shots to set the stage, close ups to catch the expressions, music to set the mood, montage to create the tension, expand it and finally when you are at the edge of you're seat, the scene goes off like lighting in the incredible climatic ending.Leone is not just any director.

Sure it's the voices of Eastwood and Wallach, but (the movie being forty years old)there voices have changed, Eastwood's voice has a lower pitch while wallach's is higher; I don't even want to go into Van Cleef's dubbing(he passed on so they brought in an impersonator to do his dialog). the dubbing quality for these new scenes are also not as good. I assume the original English dub was done in Italy. Even though the sync in audio and image was not perfect it's still one the best English dub tracks I've ever heard for motion picture. The Good: All hope is not lost however since MGM decided to include the original Italian mono track. Watching the film with this track makes the viewing experience a whole lot better.the restored scenes are better with this track as well since the Italian version was shown in its entirety when it opened in 1966.

It all seemed very macho and self-consciously cool, and it had obviously inspired all the overrated macho directors I don't like in my own generation - Tarantino, for example, and Robert Rodriguez. In short, I was unimpressed.Years later, I gave the film a second shot, watching it all the way through this time. I loved it. What had changed? For one thing, I took more notice of the technical side of the film. I paid attention to Leone's famous use of close-ups, his selection of memorable character actors, and his wonderful scene-setting. I admired the detailed sets and the sweeping landscapes, the props and the costumes and all those weird, wonderful faces that Leone clearly loved to photograph.I also got hooked by some of the quieter moments that I had skipped over in my first viewing. One of the most effective scenes involves Eli Wallach's character, Tuco, quarreling with his brother when they meet after they've been apart for years. Their argument is great, emotionally charged stuff, made all the more effective by the suggestion that they really do love and care about each other. It's the kind of sensitive, human scene you never get to see in a Tarantino or Rodriguez movie.Before I get too fuzzy-wuzzy, I should also like to point out that, on my second viewing, I LOVED all the action, too. Every gunfight is great, in its own way, and they're all a bit different. The greatest of them all is, of course, the final confrontation between the trio, which is accompanied by some of the most rousing music I've ever heard in a film. And hey, there's even a huge Civil War battle to provide a change of pace from all the small-scale action.Ultimately, \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" is probably just a potboiler of a film, without too much to say about, for example, the human condition. But what a potboiler! It doesn't have to try to be cool - it simply IS cool. In fact, it probably defined heroic coolness for an entire generation. Eli Wallach's performance, Leone's direction and Morricone's music alone are enough to elevate it to classic status - and the fact that everything else in the movie is great, too, helps elevate it to the level of perhaps the greatest action film ever made.And to think, I missed all that the first time through...", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 283, "votes": 346}, "heading": "The King of Cool", "date": "2006-08-21T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1454218", "sentiment score": [0.0378, 0.1651, 0.2171, 0.4491, 0.1309]}, {"content": "This movie is totally brilliant.

But I have NEVER watched his Westerns. That's kind of idiotic isn't it?? Well suddenly I'm having an Eastwood movement and sinking myself into Westerns for the first time in my life and it only made sense that I start with what some critics and fans call \"The Greatest Western ever made.\" In some respects I agree with that because it embodies everything that the Western is...even if you have never seen a Western you know the way they are supposed to go and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly encompasses every aspect of the stereotypical Western. Also a film like this has to be judged by it's release time as well and for 1966, this film's violent and gritty story would have made heads explode and Eastwood's trademark Man with No Name made Eastwood the gosh darned coolest, slickest man in history. The story explodes into an epic 3 + hour (extended cut) film about three man of completely different personalities, backgrounds, and goals trying to find a hidden treasure by a Civil War soldier and stay alive while basically beating the living daylights out of each other. The film is gritty, bleak, and the three main characters are so watchable that each one could carry their own film.Clint Eastwood...how can you possibly say that name and then try to critique the man's acting. If you looked up the definition of masculine in the dictionary...there his picture would be...probably from this film. Eastwood's raspy voice, his \"doesn't take any crap\" attitude, and completely violent personality (in his characters of course) makes him the best gun fighter in ANY Western. He is the perfect leading man especially for a Western and he had to be THE GOOD in The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. Eastwood is Eastwood and that is the highest compliment you can give. Lee Van Cleef embodies THE BAD, I mean the man has being a villain down to a science and although he doesn't share a whole lot of screen time with the stars he has his own brand of justice that makes him the perfect villain. In a lot of ways he is the polar opposite of Eastwood. He still has the raspy voice, and the cool demeanor and he has this killer instinct that makes him petrifying to see on screen. But all in all he doesn't get the majority of the story and there is a lot of back story to his character left unexplored. I would have loved to see a sequel or another story where he plays Angel Eyes because it would have great to see him back on screen in this role. And finally I save the best for last. I have found a new absolute favorite screen character in Tuco played by veteran actor Eli Wallach. Tuco is THE UGLY in every way shape and form. His drunken, sarcastic, and annoying personality makes him the real stand out performance in this film. In fact he seems to get the majority of the lines and the screen time as we watch his journey to try and get rich. And on top of that the tumultuous relationship between his off again, on again partner Eastwood's \"Blondie\" as named by Tuco. The two of them start as partners until Eastwood turns on him and leaves him which only makes Tuco seek revenge in a horrible way, one of the great scenes where Tuco forces Eastwood across the desert nearly killing him in the process. But you know that can only mean Eastwood will get the last word and he does. Tuco is amazing. He's hilarious, he's bumbling, but he has fantastic good luck when it comes to getting away and on top of it all despite his humorous character he's not easy to kill or a push over. He's blood thirsty, crafty and skilled as a gun man and a villain. The whole film must be watched for Wallach's Tuco alone.This is my first taste but not my last of Eastwood Westerns and Sergio Leone who apparently is the be all and end all of Action western directors. I have the first two installments of the Man With No Name trilogy fired up in the VCR and ready to go. The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly in many ways is not outstanding and yet it has this mysterious quality that just sucks you in and makes it an absolute classic. From the dusty streets of the Western town amidst the brooding Civil War and the front, this film encompasses everything. And you can't mention the film without pointing out that haunting Western theme which almost seems like it's used comically but perhaps that's because it has been used as such in the future. You can't ever start a love for Westerns without seeing this...I have no doubt. And it will permanently go down in my books as one of my favorite Westerns. I will say it didn't need to be as long as it was and perhaps more of a climatic ending would have been nice but it's a classic and you can barely pick it apart.

To this day, there hasn't been a movie that comes close to the depth and craft that his movie produces.It's a beautifully woven-together piece of cinema that Sergio knows what to do with. He creates a feeling of both intensity and humor by portraying the three key characters with one trait only; The Good (Clint Eastwood), The Bad (Lee Van Cleef), and The Ugly (Eli Wallach). These characters follow their own instincts, whether it be good or bad, and let nothing stand in their way of recovering the gold. The only problem is, they have to work together to get it. One knows the place of the gold (a graveyard), and one knows which grave it's buried under. Just how long does it take until the cowboys let their pride and betrayal ruin their treasure hunt? Though the beautiful directing is immensely distinct and original, the movie is very plot-driven. The characters don't matter to us. We could have The Good play The Ugly and it would still be the same outcome. But from Sergio's vision, comes a truly magnificent submission into the psychology of the Civil War civilians and determined, gun-shooting varmints.At first, we meet the characters by obviously seeing them do what they're intended to do. The Ugly robs a store, The Bad kills a few people, and The Good saves someone's life. After that, we see that The Ugly and The Good are actually working together to do what dirty cowboys do best; collect their money. Upon finding out about the treasure, all three characters become The Determined, and both work together and hang each other by the necks (literally) to find the gold.From beginning to end, \"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\" is utterly entertaining and unique. It can be called both a Western and a War movie. As the plot develops and thickens, we see more of the setting than in all other Westerns combined.

They are kept apart by internal pressure (the fact that one of them is a murdering sadist) and external pressure (the ebb and flow of the Civil War).In TREASURE, only one member of the team knew how to find gold. Here, the location of the gold is a secret. Two men know opposite halves of the secret. Blondie (Clint Eastwood) knows a name on a grave. Tuco Ramirez (Eli Wallach) knows the name of the cemetery.

Angel Eyes will torture and kill anybody who gets in his way. Tuco is a bully and a loudmouth, but he only kills in self-defense. Blondie is quiet and intelligent, a planner who carefully works out every detail well in advance.THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY is set in a harsh, unforgiving landscape. The quest for the gold takes our characters through a desert, a prison camp, a war-ravaged frontier town, a Civil War battle and, finally the cemetery where the inevitable showdown happens.

Leone's film about three greedy men in the search for 500,000 in gold exemplifies the dirty west. This is not your typical American western, where the sun-drenched west is romanticized. No, it's dirty and rough, just like the west was. If anyone wanted to watch the film that is the antithesis the \"chick-flick,\" I would recommend The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.Clint Eastwood reprises his iconic Man With No Name in this final film in the Dollars Trilogy. Lee Van Cleef returns from A Few Dollars More; however, he plays a different (much different) character. The actor who steals the show has to be Eli Wallach. Wallach, a western veteran, plays Tuco with great viciousness and humor, making him likable and unlikeable at the same time; he truly is \"ugly.\" Leone and his cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli pack the film with great shots of the west, from the tired sands of the desert, to the endless graves of a cemetery (which was actually located in Spain). Ennio Morricone combines Colli's lush cinematography with the greatest score ever put onto film.

I also know people who wouldn't be caught dead watching a movie made outside of the USA who love The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.

It's one of those movie moments that I look forward to no matter how many times I've seen them. I'm also a fan of the techniques Leone used in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Leone's use of the widescreen shots of the landscape inter-cut with extreme close-ups of faces is brilliant. It adds a sense of intimacy to vastness of the setting that allows the viewer feel like they're part the movie and gain some insight into the characters. It's a technique that very few other filmmakers have the guts to employ.But I sincerely doubt that Leone's film would be so widely and wildly regarded if it weren't for the music of Ennio Morricone. I've already mentioned the main title theme and \"The Ecstasy of Gold\", but these are only two examples found in this amazing score. Can you imagine the final showdown without Morricone's music? I can't think of many instances where music and film go together to create such tension and anticipation. I've already used the word \"brilliant\" to describe Leone, but it's also applicable to Morricone.Finally, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly wouldn't be the same without the three lead actors.

It is largely due to his close cooperation with Ennio Morricone, the finest Western composer after WWII. Although they were not to perfect their working relationship until Once Upon a Time in the West, the opening sequence of this film - where the yelp of a coyote is heard in the same tones as the whistle of the title music - announces that we are here to enjoy as many of our senses as film can reach, and in a manner just coordinated enough that we can allow ourselves to be swept along without concern for time.I will also say this: Until recently (for reasons I shan't get into), I have been a pacifist most of my life. It happens to have been this film that convinced me that war is a \"waste of good men\", as Eastwood's character remarks.Which reminds me to remind my reader - this is not a Western - it's a war movie; an anti-war movie. And far more powerful, as such, than all the crappy \"anti-war\" movies Hollywood churned out to please the hippies in the '60s.The \"hippies\" ended up voting for Bush's fiasco in Iraq.

Most of them were done on the kinds of budgets that wouldn't even cover the catering costs of most big budget Hollywood extravaganzas of today. And, truth be told, most of them weren't very good, with badly dubbed voices, and sadistic violence. But Sergio Leone, though he loathed the term \"spaghetti western\", was different. In his famous \"Dollars\" trilogy, he not only became a director of international renown, but he also elevated his star Clint Eastwood from the Rowdy Yates years of \"Rawhide\" to immortality as The Man With No Name. The first two films of that trilogy were 1964's A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS and 1965's FOR A FEW DOLLARS more, both of which were released in America in 1967. The final, and best, film of that trilogy was the mercurial THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY, made in 1966 and released here in America at the end of 1967. In the nearly forty years since, it has come to be seen quite rightly as the quintessential film of the much misunderstood spaghetti western genre.Eastwood reprises his Man With No Name role, having come across information from a dying casualty of the Civil War regarding a $200,000 treasure buried in a massive cemetery. The problem is, of course, this dying soldier has only told Eastwood part of the information; the other part of it is with a Mexican bandido named Tuco (Wallach, in an extension of his role in the 1960 western classic THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN). They form an uneasy alliance as they travel across the hellish landscape of the Civil War-era Southwest, along with the sadistic Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef, extending his role from FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE). Everything, of course, comes to a climax in that massive cemetery, and a traditional Leone-choreographed showdown of tremendous intensity.In contrast to A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS (which was indeed made with a fistful of dollars--$100,000) and FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE (made, of course, for a few dollars more--$400,000), Leone lavished $1.2 million on THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY; and every red cent (or lira) shows up on the screen. Leone and his cinematographer Tonino Delli Colli never miss a trick, as the film juxtaposes wide-open, albeit sun-scorched, landscapes with extreme close-ups of the characters' faces. That last aspect is most in evidence during the climactic showdown. There are also plenty of good lines to be had as well, many of them variations on \"There are two kinds of people in this world.\" The extremes in the performances of Eastwood, Wallach, and Van Cleef may make it seem like Leone doesn't have any control over the film, but he does indeed, and those extreme performances are absolutely right for this outrageously successful film.But the thing that really seals the deal in THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY, of course, is Ennio Morricone's intense music score, one of the finest composed for any kind of film ever, western or otherwise. The main theme is known to just about anyone who has ever seen even part of this movie; and the cues for the \"Ecstasy Of Gold\" and \"Trio\" scenes at the end burn with fiery intensity and sweating suspense. This successful collaboration of Leone and Morricone, begun in the two earlier films, would reach its apex in the 1969 epic that is generally agreed to be Leone's true masterpiece, ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST.Very lengthy, often blackly comic, flamboyant, and unquestionably violent, THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY is the definitive film in this much-maligned genre, and a film that, aside from the typically bad dubbing of the Italian actors, keeps having an impact to this very day.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "The Quintessential Spaghetti Western", "date": "2006-06-18T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1396381", "sentiment score": [0.0527, 0.204, 0.2182, 0.3799, 0.1452]}, {"content": "A preposterous Italian rewrite of the Civil War starts my list of what is wrong with this movie, followed by plot grotesqueries, e.g. Van Cleef becoming the commandant of a prison camp with no explanation?

This movie shirks the old, clearly defined, white hat/black hat rivals that have a predictable shoot-out in the street at the end. Now you have a backdrop of the Civil War and its tragic consequences. Also, there's a third gunfighter, \"The Ugly\" (Wallach) equal with a gun as the other two, and just as cold-blooded in using it as \"The Bad\" (Van Cleef). For good measure, there's a lot of greasy-and sweaty-faced would-be gunfighters who have the misfortune of messing with these guys. Even \"The Good\" (Eastwood) is less than perfect (but his tarnished halo gleams when he's compared to his two rivals).Lots of \"running\" dialog is here, and it's tantalizingly tempting to use a \"there's two kinds of people, my friend\" joke in the review. Each of the three men has information about where a cache of gold is hidden, but none of them has all the clues, so they have to form uneasy alliances. There's good character development, as you learn about the relationship of the three gunfighters, their backgrounds, and why they act as they do (particularly Wallach's character).Also, there's ongoing and poignant Civil War episodes that move parallel with the gunfighters' story. The scene of a character running madly through a cemetery is stunning in its double-meaning eloquence.This story inexorably approaches the ultimate western movie signature event, as they gamble their lives against their 1-in-3 chance to survive and claim the golden prize. However, the classic duel in the sun is here built to with exhilarating tension, as the combatants assume a unique positioning for the fight; all the while, the famous music score rises in intensity to complement this climactic moment of truth.Don't dismiss this epic masterpiece as a \"horse-opera\" or a \"spaghetti western.\" There's a lot more going on here than good guys and bad guys riding horses and shooting it out.

The 'Once upon a time ...' movies would see Leone's films take on a much darker turn but although there is quite a lot of violence and death on display here, this is an almost jovial epic, (the humour comes from Leone's subversion of traditional western clich\u00e9s). Almost every sequence feels, and looks, like a classic, (the climatic gunfight has the choreographed precision of a ballet), Tonino Delli Colli's widescreen cinematography is magnificent, and although dubbed, (very effectively), the English translation of the Italian script is first-class.The plot is simplicity itself as Clint Eastwood, Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef search for some buried gold but the plot is only the thread of a much richer tapestry centered round events in the American Civil War. Stylistically and thematically this film would later influence Eastwood as a director.

Clint Eastwood rarely talks and Lee Van Cleef is menacing but honorable at the same time.Why is this movie so good? Frankly, I have no clue. From a technical standpoint, the pacing is awful. The movie runs for 3 hours, which is much too long for what its plot is. Much of the screen time is dedicated to a staring contest between participants in a gunfight.My best guess as to why this movie resonates so deeply with all of us is because of the lack of a good guy. All three of the characters are not very nice. There is no sheriff to dull the action. But they all have a good side. Lee Van Cleef's is the hardest to see. In fact the only good one can even see in him is the fact that he doesn't kill certain characters when he has a chance to such as Bill Carson's whore or Blondie. But somehow Leone extends this (or maybe its just me)... I just don't see Angel Eyes as completely bad.Blondie and Tuco have a strange love/hate relationship. We can all relate to their friendship. They're only friends when it benefits them... or are they? Blondie's actions at the end suggest that maybe the Man with No Name actually cares.And the famous final gunfight. Its been emulated so many times, but never matched. God its perfect cinema. Never have I seen such a tense moment in the history of film. I will never forget the first time I saw the film and the gunfight. I was drawn in instantly.But my favorite parts of the film are the little touching side stories and add-ins that Leone gives. The legless desperado who receives money for the information he provides and then wastes his money on liquor; the scene in the monastery with Tuco and his brother; the drunken general; and the dying Confederate soldier at the end... these scenes are what give The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly the kind of beauty that lacks in so many other western copycats.Sure Blondie is one cool guy who pretends that he doesn't have a heart. But when he finally reaches his catharsis... when he finally admits how much the war is \"a waste of men\"... we realize that Blondie does have a heart -- he just hides it.Why? Maybe because it hurts too much to show it. A Fistful of Dollars suggests that (Although Leone never intended for the dollars movies to be connected). If you haven't seen this movie, you are missing out on a landmark Italian movie. After watching this, I was hooked on Italian film. I started watching all of Leone, Fellini, Argento...

In a way, it's a morality play, weighing the consequences of good and evil, but it does so in its realistic portrayal that sometimes, crime DOES pay, at least in the short term, and sometimes good DOES go unrewarded.This film ushered in a new concept of a previously all too oft told Western story, probably tolling the death knell for the traditional American-made, Good guy/ Bad guy, White hat/ Black hat Western that was so prevalent before it.The three main characters of the film are as powerful as Leone's brilliant vision of the Civil War era America, he used as their backdrop. Lee Van Cleef ('The Bad') is evil in the flesh. Beedy-eyed and totally ruthless, he believes it only takes one thing to be successful: whatever is necessary.Clint Eastwood ('The Good') is the now legendary 'Man With No Name', but 'good' only in a Western concept of non-traditional good. He has a sometimes detectable and occasionally observable sense of honor that motivates his behavior and conduct from time to time.Eli Wallach ('The Ugly') is Tuco, and he's easily the most colorful character in the film. Impulsive and full of barely suppressible rage, Tuco gyrates wildly throughout the movie, stealing, lying, pretending to be a best friend in one scene, trying to kill in another. Tuco truly represents 'the ugly' side of human behavior.At two hours and forty-one minutes, the movie was lengthy for its day, but there's neither a single scene that seems unnecessary, nor does the film seem lengthy while viewing it. The film unfolds with a charismatic style and grace, slowly revealing more and more about each character and the film's story. The pace of the film expertly captures the flavor of the time, giving the viewer a rare peek into a page of American history come alive on film.Director Sergio Leone (who contributed to another epic of note: 'Ben-Hur' as an uncredited second unit director in 1959) manages to build a lot of sometimes unsettling tension in the film, thus preventing the longer than usual movie from ever getting uncomfortable or predictable. Every typical Western clich\u00e9 possibly imaginable is either given a unique twist or utterly destroyed by Leone's masterful storytelling. Of special honorable mention is Ennio Morricone's original music score, which is about as masterful and complementary as it gets, culminating in the climatic gunfight in the cemetery at the end of the film. The music is so rich and powerful it easily stands on its own merits, and is one of the biggest selling original movie soundtracks to date. It is impossible to imagine the film without it.'Unforgiven' may well have been the sequel to 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', the story of what eventually happened to the 'Man With No Name', and won Oscars for Best Picture and Best Director, and the nomination for Best Actor for Eastwood in 1992 (the film also was nominated in six other categories and won in three of those). Eastwood dedicated this movie to Sergio Leone who died 30 April 1989 in Rome, and who had believed in him early in his career.Call it 'Buono, il brutto, il cattivo, Il' or call it 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', but after seeing it you'll call this movie absolutely brilliant at MANY levels, including the one mentioned above by Kitchener.It is a classic like no other, and is easily one of the best Westerns and films of its kind ever made.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 4, "votes": 5}, "heading": "One of the Best Westerns Ever Made...", "date": "2006-03-26T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1326480", "sentiment score": [0.0127, 0.0568, 0.165, 0.5309, 0.2346]}, {"content": "I don't know why I love this movie, but it is one of my favorites.

Intricate plot connections with character and human nature pushing the story along with a war playing a significant supporting character make this one of the greatest stories ever shown on film. Leone does an excellent job of not jumping right into the treasure hunt aspect of he film but instead lets the characters develop and interact and then fall upon the main story line. It is often said that Leone was special due to the fact that he realized the face as a landscape. This is ever evident in the opening shot of the film in which we see one of Tuco's many enemies, but only the very front of his face at first showing a worn, torn, mean side of the previously over glorified American West. The character appears mean and tough and as though anyone who crosses him is sure to meet a hasty end. This is not the case however when \"the Ugly\" Tuco Ramirez bests him and his comrades even when matched against he element of surprise. Here is evident part of the humor of the film, the unassuming Tuco, however flawed he may be, is never the less a master of armed combat. It is his character, made lovable with such contradictions, that pushes the plot along. Many people look to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid as the father of all buddy movies but this was released earlier and while Tuco and Eastwood's characters aren't exactly friends(it seems that Blondie just favorites Tuco as a partner due to the fact that he can easily be out witted) they have some very entertaining interaction and really start the whole unwanted partnership theme so oft copied by the movies that would follow. This them has developed to the point of being the almost exclusive relationship appearing in todays animated films such as Shrek and Ice Age. This film does so much with story yet doesn't compromise an ounce of style. The camera work is phenomenal and creates a mood so strong that even if you don't care for a specific character you can still be fearful for the situation he is in. The music is unforgettable and has remained in pop culture to this day.

It's spectacular, it's thrilling, it's beautiful. You won't find anything like this now-a-days, no matter how hard you try. Anyone who hasn't seen this movie should be ashamed of himself.The plot is simple - Blondie (Clint Eastwood), the Good, Tuco (Eli Wallach), the Ugly, and Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), the Bad, are all after a stash of Confederate gold, holding 200,000 dollars in gold, during the American Civil War. Seems like a pretty simple plot for 1 and a half hours, let alone 3. So what drives this movie? Style. Cinematography. Atmosphere. Let me explain.The first scene in the movie is the (rather unappealing) face of a bandit. It then switches to a wide shot of the small town he and his two companions are entering. A few more shots of the bandits. They enter an inn, and gunshots are heard. Out the window comes charging Tuco, clutching a gun in one hand and meat in the other. The image freezes while he's in midair, and the writing \"The Ugly\" appears on the screen. The first half hour or so serves to introduce the three main characters in similar fashion. No plot progression whatsoever, merely introduction. Most movies would fall with a start like that, but not this one. It takes more than an hour before the rush for the gold begins, and by that hour you already know everything you can and need to know about the three anti-heroes: Blondie is the Good. He is not good at all under normal standards, as he is an outlaw, a killer and he betrays his \"friend\". But he seems good in comparison to the other slime-balls in the movie: Tuco is a villain, pure and simple. He steals, murderers, rapes, and does a bunch of other nasty things. But he is still fun and amusing, while the sinister Angel Eyes stands in comparison - a menacing figure in black clothing with an evil mustache, who kills and double-crosses without blinking for a few more dollars.And the movie doesn't follow a plot. The plot is just a background for the amazing scenes that come one after another and construct the movie - you go from one scene to the other. And there are many memorable scenes in this movie: The first time Blondie shoots the rope before Tuco is hanged to death. Blondie's march through the desert. Tuco and Blondie's capture by the Yankees. Tuco's torture. Tuco's gunfight in the tub and the classic line that follows. The showdown in the deserted town. The bridge being blown up. Tuco's search for the grave. And of course, the amazing climax. But I'll get to that later.We've covered the style, but I also mentioned cinematography and atmosphere. And the cinematography is amazing. Wide shots of towns and deserts zoom to close-ups of desperate and rugged men. The effect is amazing, especially during gunfights. It creates tension and suspense, and that leads me to the second point I mentioned: atmosphere. This feels like the West. The people look dirty and hard-working. The buildings look rickety. And when time is spent looking at each other before the guns are drawn for a few short seconds when the men fire at each other, you feel what it's like to be there.And finally, as I mentioned before, the climax. Possibly the best climax in a movie ever. A Mexican Standoff between the three main characters in the film - Blondie, Angel Eyes and Tuco. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. Minutes pass as they stare at each other, each bringing their hand a bit closer to the gun. The music becomes more and more dramatic as time passes. You wait, and then... They fire, and it's over. A duel as a duel should be. It's mind-blowing.Few movies can reach the level of this masterpiece. Fewer still can surpass it.

Yet, I think I can safely say that there is not a wasted shot in the whole film. Leone is able to use each scene to perfection. He uses wide shots at the right time. He uses close-ups when he needs to. He puts in long shots for the perfect effect. This is such a well constructed movie. Many people might consider it sloppy and rough. I think it is amazing. There are many shots in which Leone isolates the characters. I don't remember many shots where more than one character are in the frame at the same time. When they are, there is almost always space between them. His characters are out for themselves, and for no one else. Their connection with other characters exist only in their desire and drive for gold. There are many shots in which a character stands surrounded by vast nothingness. Leone's characters are in control of their own wills, but they are not in control of their destinies. Consider the scene where Tuco is about to kill Blondie in the hotel. A canon hits the room before he can accomplish this. Blondie seems to be the only person who controls his fate, and he doesn't have ultimate control. The acting is superb. Eastwood doesn't little enough to give his character tremendous depth and mystery. He isn't merely stoic and squinting. He is a true character with many levels. Wallach is extreme and not other the top. It would be very easy for the character to be cartoonish. Yet Leone and Wallach are able to give him many different facets. Angel Eyes is truly evil.

In the arena of Westerns, Sergio Leone's works are unmatched in their strikingly visual approach, namely, the extensive use of dramatic widescreen shots interleaved with moments of extreme close-ups. Apart from creating a complete sub-genre of Westerns, lovingly called \"Spaghetti Westerns\" - mostly because of the Italian origins of the filmmaker and the fact that his movies were shot in Europe instead of Hollywood - Sergio Leone built the foundation of Clint Eastwood's super-stardom. \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" is one such ageless piece of work, beautiful to behold. After \"A Fistful Of Dollars\" and \"For A Few Dollars More\", it is the third part in a series of movies featuring Eastwood as \"The Man With No Name\".The basic story of \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" is actually a simple treasure hunt, but still Leone allows himself almost three hours to develop all its details. It is a plot with endless, unexpected twists and turns, making this movie a highly entertaining experience. Clint Eastwood became an Western icon through those movies and we still tend to remember him as \"The Man With No Name\", even though he left this role behind over thirty years ago. His charismatic, enigmatic, dry portrayal of the laid-back \"Blondie\" is stunning and it carries the movie. It is Eli Wallach, however, who makes the biggest impression as the somewhat dense Tuco. He puts so much character in this personality that, no matter how bad he is, we always care and sympathize for him. Crowning it with the right amount of humor, slyness, and humanity, Wallach puts in one of the most memorable performances in this movie Probably everyone has heard Ennio Morricone's brilliant musical score to \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" at some point or another. Its ferocious, war-cry-style main theme is as memorable as it is effective. Beside \"Once Upon A Time In The West\", this score is probably his best work ever and helped to stylize the unique image and appeal of Italian Westerns. It is a magnificent score that perfectly accompanies the movie's many twists, always finds the right note, and helps the audience experience every single scene more fully. The disc has a monaural Dolby Digital soundtrack, and comes fully dubbed in English, French, and Spanish. Subtitles are also supplied in English, French, and Spanish.\"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" is an exceptional movie for its richness and the peculiarity of being a Western set against the violent background of the American Civil War. The picture are fantastic and its a real cinema art to the eyes. The way Leone timed the music and the pictures are perfection. It is a serious, infectiously humorous movie with striking images and a clever plot. The quality of the DVD is remarkable and makes this movie an all-time favorite of mine. You have to own this.

TGBU is the final part of Sergio Leone's 'Dollar Trilogy' and if you've seen the previous two films, TGBU seems a lot more polished. Similar elements seen and heard in the first two films are used in TGBU, but to greater effect, producing a truly unforgettable experience. I remember watching this film many times when I was about 8 or 9 years old and loving it back then, and I hadn't really seen it since then, until I was 23.

On t'other hand though, for the purposes of the story, it wouldn't've made much sense to put more women in just for the sake of having more women in the film.

Basically, set during the American Civil War, a trio of bounty hunters attempt to kill fugitive Mexican bandit Tuco Ram\u00edrez, \"the Ugly\" (Eli Wallach). Tuco shoots the three bounty hunters and escapes on horseback. Elsewhere, mercenary Angel Eyes, \"the Bad\" (Lee Van Cleef) interrogates former Confederate soldier Stevens (Antonio Casas), to find out about the new name of Jackson, a fugitive who has stolen and hidden bags of gold. Steven tells Angel Eyes that Jackson is using the new name Bill Carson. Stevens offers the bounty hunter $1,000 to kill Baker (Livio Lorenzon), his employer. Angel Eyes takes the money, but kills Stevens, fulfilling his contract. He then returns to Baker, collects his fee for killing Stevens, and then, shoots Baker. Meanwhile, Tuco is rescued from three bounty hunters by a drifter, a \"Man with No Name\" to whom Tuco refers as \"Blondie\" (Clint Eastwood), who takes him to the local Sheriff (John Bartha) to collect his $2,000 bounty. As Tuco is about to be hanged, Blondie sets Tuco fre, shooting the noose. The two escape on horseback and split the bounty in a lucrative money-making scheme. They repeat the process in another town for more reward money. Blondie grows weary of Tuco's complaints and abandons him without horse or water in the desert. Tuco manages to walk to a village, and tracks Blondie down. He plans to force him to hang himself before Union forces distract him, and Blondie is able to escape. Tuco manages to recapture Blondie and forces to walk across the desert until he collapses from dehydration. As Tuco prepares to shoot him, he sees a runaway carriage. Inside are several dead Confederate soldiers and a near-death Bill Carson (Antonio Casale), who promises Tuco $200,000 in gold, buried in a grave in Sad Hill Cemetery. Tuco demands to know the name on the grave, but Carson collapses from thirst before answering. When Tuco returns with water, Carson has died, but Blondie, slumped next to him, reveals that Carson told him the name on the grave before dying. Tuco is now motivated to keep Blondie alive, he gives him water and takes him to a nearby mission to recover. After Blondie's recovery, the two leave in Confederate uniforms from Carson's carriage, but Union soldiers capture them and take them to the prisoner of war camp of Batterville. Tuco answers to the name \"Bill Carson\" during roll call, gaining the attention of Angel Eyes, disguised as a Union sergeant. Angel Eyes tortures Tuco, who reveals the name of the cemetery, but confesses that only Blondie knows the name on the grave. Knowing he will not talk if tortured, Angel Eyes offer Blondie an equal share of the gold and a partnership. Blondie agrees and rides out with Angel Eyes and his gang. Tuco is packed on a train to be executed, but escapes. Blondie, Angel Eyes, and his henchmen arrive in an evacuated town; Tuco eventually makes his way to the same town. Tuco takes a bath, during which he is surprised by one of the earlier three bounty hunters, Elam (Al Mulock), but he manages to shoot him dead. Blondie investigates the gunshots and finds Tuco, they agree to resume their old partnership. The pair kill Angel Eyes's men, but Angel Eyes himself has escaped. Tuco and Blondie travel toward Sad Hill, but their way is blocked by a battle between Union troops and the Confederates. Blondie decides to destroy the bridge to disperse the two armies and allow them access to the cemetery. As they wire the bridge with explosives, Tuco suggests they share information, in case one person dies before he can help the other. Tuco reveals the name of the cemetery, while Blondie says \"Arch Stanton\" is the name on the grave where the gold is buried. After the bridge explodes, the armies disperse. On their way, Blondie finds a dying soldier, but is unable to help him, he takes a poncho following the young man's death. Tuco steals a horse and rides to Sad Hill to claim the gold for himself, but Blondie fires a cannon, causing him to fall, and fires further to intimidate him. Tuco eventually makes it to the cemetery and runs, passing the various graves, to find the named grave marker. He finds the name Arch Stanton and begins digging, and Blondie arrives and encourages him at gunpoint to continue. Moments later, Angel Eyes surprises them both. Blondie opens Stanton's grave, revealing only a skeleton, no gold. Blondie states that he lied and offers to write the real name of the grave on a rock, placing it face-down in the courtyard of the cemetery, challenging Tuco and Angel Eyes to a three-way duel. The trio stare each other down in a Mexican standoff. Everyone draws, and Blondie shoots and kills Angel Eyes, while Tuco discovers that his own gun was unloaded by Blondie the night before. Blondie reveals that the gold is actually in the grave beside Arch Stanton's, marked \"Unknown\". Tuco digs and elated to find the six bags of gold pieces, but Blondie holds him at gunpoint. He orders him into a hangman's noose, standing balanced precariously on top of an unsteady grave marker beneath a tree. Blondie takes half the gold and rides away. As Tuco screams for mercy, Blondie returns into sight. From the distance, Blondie fires a rifle shot at the rope, dropping Tuco, alive but tied up, onto his share of the gold. Tuco curses loudly while Blondie rides off into the horizon. Eastwood as the iconic \"Man with No Name\" is cool, looking steely eyed, smoking cigars, wearing a few different costumes, ending in his iconic poncho, it is said most of his dialogue was cut to make him more mysterious, this third and final film cemented him as an international superstar. The film does have lip-sync and dubbing issues, it is admittedly long, but for Eastwood, the likeable Wallach, the Civil War battle sequence, the violence, the final showdown, and the memorable score by Ennio Morricone, this is a fantastic classic western. Clint Eastwood was number 18 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 61 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and the film was number 46 on The 100 Greatest Films.

Period. I lack the words to express my admiration for this film adequately, but i'll try to indicate how brilliant this film is. This film is pure cinematic perfection. The story, the brilliant directing, the impressive cinematography, the unique atmosphere, the ingenious score, the great characters, the unforgettable performances, the dialogue, the wit, the violence,... everything in this film is pure perfection! This is one of the few movies that actually deserve their high ranking in IMDb's Top 250 list, and if I was to make such a list, \"The Good, The Bad And The Ugly\" would rank even higher. Leone's brilliant directing and a superb cinematography come along with what is maybe the greatest of Ennio Morricone's unique soundtracks. Each one of the three leading actors fits perfectly in his role. As in the movie's two predecessors, \"A Fistful Of Dollars\" (1964) and \"For A Few Dollars More\" (1965), Clint Eastwood ('The Good')is the epitome of coolness in his role of the Man with No Name (who actually always has a name - He is credited as 'Joe' in \"Fistful Of Dollars\", his character is called 'Monco' in \"For A Few Dollars More\", and he is referred to as \"Blondie\" in \"The Good The Bad And The Ugly\"). Together with irascible MexicanTuco ('The Ugly' brilliantly played by Eli Wallach), he rips authorities off by collecting the reward, that is set on Tuco's head and then saving him a very second before his execution.Since I first saw this Dollar Trilogy as a kid, the word 'coolness' is linked with this character played by Clint Eastwood. No other character in any other film is embodies coolness the way The Man With No Name does in the Dollar trilogy, and no other ever will.Lee Van Cleef ('The Bad'), one of my personal favorite actors of all-time, and one of the true icons of the Italian Western, is brilliant in the role of Sentenza aka. Angel Eyes, a ruthless assassin who knows no mercy or scruples to achieve his goals. While all of the three men are selfish crooks, and all of them selfish and violent in getting what they want, Sentenza is truly evil, and Lee Van Cleef plays this role with absolute brilliance.The arguably greatest performance, however is delivered by Eli Wallach as 'The Ugly' Mexican bandit Tuco. Hot-tempered, irascible, savage and yet crafty, and sometimes sadistically vengeful, Tuco is a criminal with an immense crime record and an immense talent to survive hangings (with the help of 'The Good'). Eli Wallach's performance as Tuco is ingenious beyond comparison. Wallach plays 'The Ugly', his anger and rage, his quick, violent temper and brutality, his savagery but also his craftiness with a unique brilliance. Wallach's performance is not only THE single greatest performance ever in a Western, but, as far as I am considered, also one of the greatest performances ever in a movie. Set in one of the final years of the American Civil War, somewhere in the southwest of the US, \"The Good, the Bad And the Ugly\" tells the story of these three men, who are on the hunt for a case carrying 200,000 dollars in gold, buried somewhere in a graveyard.Each of the three men wants the gold for himself, of course, but since none of them has all the information they need, they have to work together in order to get it. Although all three of them are reckless and sneaky, Clint Eastwood (despite to being an antihero and crook that shoots a lot of people, the Man With No Name shows some mercy and charity in comparison to the foregoing movies \"For a Fistful of Dollars\" and \"For a Few Dollars More\") is rightly referred to as the Good, Eli Wallach, playing the angry thug Tuco, is the epitome of (the) Ugly, and Lee Van Cleef is wonderfully evil and ruthless as The Bad.\"The Good, the Bad And the Ugly\", a Spaghetti Western at the genre's best, is a brilliant movie full of violence and dark humor, a film full of wit and pictures that will make a great visual impact on everybody with taste, a masterpiece going along with one of the most brilliant scores of all time. This is not only a film that every cineaste should see this is a film that EVERYBODY MUST SEE! If I was to name my favorite movies of all-time, \"The Good, The Bad And The Ugly\" would be one of the strongest contenders for Numero Uno! In one sentence: \"The Good, The Bad And The Ugly\" is one of the greatest films ever made!

The character of mwnm (short) leaves one in amazement at the beautiful shades of grey that Hollywood paints its characters in. On one end, the hard, ruthless killer, the fastest hand in the west, stopping at nothing to get his bounty and on the other, the tender caring humanitarian, uniting a mother forced into prostitution, with her husband and child, saving a man who stood by him, giving a dying soldier his last smoke. Eastwood excels in an underplayed role, mixing quiet aggression with an angelic demeanor; a potent combination, which any hit-man today would kill for.Ably supported by an array of Mexican acting talent and the likes of Lee Van Cliff and Eli Wallah, this trilogy, transports you to a world, where people wore their heart on their sleeves, had a contempt for their own lives and for that of others, a world where surviving each passing day was as challenging as moving from one dusty town to another, as though one were moving from one battlefield to the next. The savagery of the wild west is given a sublime touch by the hauntingly soulful soundtrack; the musical mastery of Enrico Morricone. Kudos Amigo!

It is a western-and probably the greatest western I've seen-that takes place during the Civil War (1862).In the beginning of the movie, Eastwood's unnamed character dubbed by Wallach's character \"Blondie\" (usually credited as \"Joe\") meets and partner's up with the Mexican Tuco Ramirez (Wallach). Soon Blondie double crosses Tuco and Tuco swears revenge. While he is getting revenge by making Blondie walk through the desert with no water for miles, they stumble upon a dying man who in return for a promise of water tells them where $100,000 is buried. The only problem is that he tells Tuco what cemetery it's in, and tells Blondie the grave just before dying. They once again are partners and their future wealth depends on the other. Unfortunately, a notorious bounty hunter, who will do anything for money, Sentenza (Lee Van Cleef) nicknamed \"Angel Eyes\" knows of the money and tries to find it. Along the way the three run into the Civil War and our two heroes even get taken in as prisoners.The actors were well chosen. All three are/were amazing actors able to portray the characters perfectly. It's not often that a Jewish actor from Brooklyn is as convincing of a Mexican as Wallach. He was able to give amazing life and character to the greedy, dirty, yet humorous, and somewhat lovable Tuco that I don't think the best actor of today could top. Eastwood played the type of tough, gun slinging, cowboy that he was so good at and I think he was born for. It seemed as if it were him just being his natural self the way he played Blondie, he was kind and showed compassion just with the expression on his face with the slightly squinting eyes and his constant offer of the only thing he could give to comfort someone, a cigar; and smart and reasonable, yet he was ready to kill anyone who started trouble or was in his way. Finally, Lee Van Cleef plays the bad-ass Angel Eyes, showing complete greed, and evil. His character is as cruel as can be and doesn't care who he kills or what happens to others just as long as he gets it his way, as he always does. Even the small characters played their part well from the drunk Union Captain to the old storekeeper whom gave me a few laughs to Father Ramirez (Tuco's brother) to even the poor fellow whom Angel Eyes kills in the beginning. And all actors gave a realistic look to it by the way they acted. They were not like some others in Westerns that had completely clean and well shaven faces. They had visible sweat and dirt on their faces, their hair was not always well combed (especially Tuco) and they were ragged when needed, they were more truthful, you can't go across the desert without getting dirty and sweaty. You could look at their faces and say \"wow, look at Tuco, he's dirty and unkempt\" and \"wow, Blondie's face is all messed up\u0085 not the condition you expect the main character to be in\" or \"Not only does Angel Eyes have a dirty, cruel personality, but he looks so too.\" Another phenomenal thing about this movie was the soundtrack made by the ingenious Ennio Morricone. To call it amazing would be an understatement. The opening credits alone which is where that great music first graces the ears of the audience with its beauty are amazing. Even without seeing or hearing of the movie, you know the music, weather you've seen the movie or not. It has been in so many places, imitated so many times\u0085 you could start playing it to someone who never saw a second of the movie and they'd whistle along to the familiar tune. In parts it is strong and in other parts it is soft as a kitten. In parts it bears the feeling of adventure and excitement, and in others through the air vibrates music more solemn and serious. In many parts, the movement of characters is done to the music. It is a famous and historic soundtrack and is most definitely the most famous of Morricone's work.Leone directed it fantastically too. Firstly, he uses the widescreen in a way unlike any other except Akira Kurisawa. Every inch of the screen is important to him, and he either fills it all with people and action, or makes it empty to create an emptier effect. He also does many great camera angles and shots. For example, a sequence of cannon fire looking straight at the mouth of the cannon or from the side or some slanted angle. He quickly cuts between the firing cannons to show pandemonium and to make it seem like heavier bombardment than it could if he simply showed the land being hit. He also deserves great credit (along with Luciano Vincenzoni) for writing such a great story and script. It is also worthy to mention how he went about the scene in which the characters blow up a bridge. He hired men to build a huge bridge and then rig it up with dynamite. Knowing that he only had one chance at this scene, he set up cameras all over the place to make a great moment in the movie and capture such a great image.I highly recommend seeing this movie and others with these actors and Leone. This movie alone has changed my life and influenced me with ideas. There is so much to enjoy, observe, and learn from this film. Anyone who sees this movie can see that the actors are amazing, that Leone is an auteur, and Morricone a musical genius.

This is the third sequel of the trilogy marked by \"The man with no name\". The viewers should also see \"A fistful of dollars\" and \"For a few dollars more\". Though none of them are linked by stories but the time-line in America and the lifestyle in wild wild west. In this movie, Clint partners with Tuco who is already an infamous outlaw under search by many counties. Clint hands Tuco over to the courts, gets the declared money and during the time of punishment (to be hanged) he shoots the hanging rope to separate Tuco and escape. This is a business to him.Soon Tuco demands lion's share what Clint denies to do and he punishes Tuco by leaving in a deserted land alone. Tuco just survives and seeks for Clint to revenge. He finds him at the point of his gun, forces Clint to walk long over the sandy desert almost ruined and suddenly meets a horse-cart running unmanned but carrying dead bodies.One of the passengers in that cart was dying, Bill Carson, gave Tuco a route to a cemetery where huge amount of dollars is buried under a grave. When asked about the name of the grave, the man was listing and Tuco ran to collect some water for him. Returning, he saw him dead, Clint faintly sat beside him and Bill Carson told him the name of the grave before dying.Another man was in hunt for that treasury, Sentenza. He already killed a family and few other men to find Bill Carson. Suddenly he found Tuco and Clint. Tuco had to speak the name of the cemetery under extreme torture. Yet Clint had been untouched and Sentenza took him with. Tuco managed to escape from Sentenza's guards cleverly. En route Tuco and Clint met again to form the partnership and they flew from the grip of Sentenza. Then they took part to a battle between American armies of different belief. Ultimately they found the cemetery.The rest of the story is unique and to be seen in screen only.The cameraman has taken very close shots of the faces full with expression. The dresses of the actors are very authentic to the time of the story. The acting of Clint, Tuco and Sentenza is superb! The spot selection is excellent!

The story is a simple one to follow and is brilliantly executed by Sergio Leone using just the right landscapes along with some pretty good sets too (like the one featuring the Civil War sequence). Some of the scenes were meant to be symbolic (especially the Civil War scenes) and they did their job well.Eli Wallach is simply superb with his \"Blondieeee!!!\" screams and curses. Lee Van Cleef seems as deadly as the great Eastwood himself as \"The Bad\" guy.Cinematography - not as continuous as one would like - but manages to convey the tension in the dueling scenes very effectively.Also, the music - Ennio Morricone at his best! He has dished out some very innovative and brilliant stuff for all the three \"great\" westerns and this along with \"For a Few Dollars More\" seems to be his best.Finally, the style! Sergio Leone can certainly teach a thing or two to Quentin Tarantino or The Wachowski Brothers - in fact Tarantino acknowledges Leone's great style. And then the epitome of style himself - Clint Eastwood - with a half-burnt cigar in his lips, unshaven face, tilted hat, ragged jeans, a worn out poncho and the sharpest scowl ever which can rub out any \"Neo-with-million-dollar-goggles\" off the face of the Earth.Not genre-defining, surely - it was invented by Hollywood.

The quest for greed and the twist at the end are enough for anyone to identify with who has bought a lottery ticket. The grittiness of the Civil War battle scene and the actions of \"Blondie\" and Tuco to both end the bloodshed and clear the way for their treasure are effective to convey the sense of agony of the Civil War. The prisoner scene and the music played during the torture scene is macabre and surreal.So in other words there is something to trigger a variety of emotions and thoughts. The camaraderie created between Blondie and Tuco through their reward escapades to the march across the desert forced on Blondie by Tuco to their ultimate decisions at the climax (no spoiler here!), is twisted but understandable.The brief interlude at the mission fully explains Tuco's choices and makes us understand clearly the relationship between Tuco and his brother.

Eli Wallach and Lee Van Cleef are just as good.The script is quite different from other westerns too: it's not just about revenge or save a city from bad guys, the story leans over deeper human feelings: greed, friendship, national pride. The characters are far more intricate than in other westerns I've seen, you never know what really motivates them and, which is to me the best: the Good guy isn't always good, the Bad guy isn't as bad as you could imagine, and the Ugly guy might be the most attaching gangster I've known. The dialogs will always be remembered: in this movie, the three guys shoot more with words than with guns and you cannot believe the amount of lines about which you will think \"Gosh, I wish I could tell one of these.\" The movie might seem a little long but to me, it was worth traveling through the Wild West in the middle of the Civil War considering the last but one scene. The final shooting is so intense, the stake is so high and most of all, for the first time since the beginning of the movie you can really listen to (and not just hear) the incredible score by Ennio Morricone.

Anyway, the last half hour of movie is magic and I could watch it in any language, in any conditions and still enjoy it.If you've not seen this movie yet, watch it as soon as possible, I promise you will love it (or at least you could shine on every one on \"how much you didn't like Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo\").

People use this name for saying reviews for movies like \"The good of the movie, the bad of it and the ugly\". But what exactly is \"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\", and how did it spawn? It has been tagged \"The greatest western of the 1960s, and of all time -- and I cant help but agree. I discovered \"The Good the Bad and the Ugly\" through my good friend who owned the DVD. I had seen the raving review of the film but I had never really been a fan of westerns.

The man with no name trilogy consists of three different films, \"A fistful of dollars\", \"For a few dollars more\", and of course, \"the good the bad and the ugly\". Clint Eastwood stars as \"The man with no name\", a mysterious figure whom we don't know about his past, his future, who he is or what his purpose is, but in the three films and especially the good the bad and the ugly, he is supremely bad-ass.

At different points of the movie, Blondie and Tuco work together, then betray each other, then come to work together again. At other points of the movie, Angel Eyes works together with Blondie, leaving Tuco as the out man.The story begins before Tuco and Blondie meet up. After meeting, they then work together to collect bounties on Tuco who is worth $1000s. The team can split the bounties as they move territory to territory scamming the law. With each new town, Blondie collects the bounty, then saves Tuco from actually being put to death, then they divide up the bounty.Problems begin as greed sets in. With in a short time, Blondie abandons Tuco after rescuing him, even after Tuco warned him to never betray him and leave him alive. Eventually, the roles are reversed, and it is Tuco who abuses Blondie and nearly causes his death.But this is where the story takes a major twist, as a run away wagon with a nearly dead passenger reveals secrets of a treasure, but each Tuco and the half dead Blondie only learn a vital part of the secret from. So now Tuco must save Blondie to get to the treasure.The story continues from there, and we get to learn quite a bit about the characters. Especially Tuco, in my opinion Leone purposely allowed us to see that indeed there were no defined roles as who was \"the good\", \"the bad\", and \"the ugly\". Greed is very powerful, especially when life is such a struggle to begin with.The final showdown is unbelievable. It is epic, and is absolutely worth anything to see. It's the pinnacle of movie making, the showdown, the movie, the characters, the drama building. Truly a masterpiece.This movie is great, it's a cinematic masterpiece.

Before his time John Wayne would ride on his horse and save the day and then ride off into the sunset, and once again it would just be our typical Cowboy hero movie with an occasion white man playing an Indian. But then one day Sergio Leone wanted us to get off our high horse and look at how corrupt the west real could be, give us the sense that our heroes in this world are by no means perfect in any way; in other words I honestly believe that until Leone's movies, we didn't get a real good artist in depth look at the WILD West. He made the hero of his three movies rough, tough, corrupt, deadly, and by no means innocent. The only thing that separated him from a bad guy was his heart. He basically didn't like anyone that was worse of a man than him, which you must admire. The sad thing is that until these movies, all of our heroes were clean cut, nice, do-gooders, always around to save the day and get the girls.

People define epic in all sorts of ways: it can mean it's ambitious, it can mean its running length is long, it can mean it's a visual spectacle, it can mean its anticlimactic, etc. And although I think The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly are all those things, that's not why it's epic to me. For a movie to be epic to me, it has to not only be ambitious, but pay off greatly; so great that after the film, I wish I could've been in the mind of that filmmaker when they thought up that film. And imperfect as it can be, The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly is certainly that.The Good is Clint Eastwood, a nameless drifter who goes by the name Blondie. I like him because he's certainly cool, but no to the point of ridiculousness. The Good is pursued by The Ugly (Eli Wallach), a greedy bandit who seeks revenge on Blondie for leaving him out to hang dry. However, his motives eventually change when Blondie tells him he has been told by a man the graveyard that holds enough gold to last someone for the rest of their lives. Eli Wallach does a superlative job in disgusting us with his character, only letting his human side spill out in a confrontation with his priest brother. The Bad (Lee Van Cleef) is also aware of the money, but only Blondie supposedly knows where the gold is hiding. Lee Van Cleef doesn't get much time to be more than the \"bad guy\", but he's ably menacing.\"The Man with No Name\" trilogy to which The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly belongs is considered the seeds of the spaghetti western genre, and it also marks a beginning of less admirable Western heroes. While the Good is still likable and we root for him, his motive, like the Bad and the Ugly, is the gold. He isn't the old western hero who stands up for the woman and throws material possessions away. Clint Eastwood will not go to the lengths of greed the Bad and Ugly sink to, but it's not like he doesn't want the gold.Sergio Leone often takes the western out of its conventional definition over the nearly three-hour length of the film by often going in new places. Although the first half-hour or so is slow (the biggest flaw of the film), it quickly picks up after that, with The Ugly dragging Blondie across the desert, visits to a church and a Civil War prison camp, and on the front lines of a Civil War battle. It all leads up to the final three-way shootout, which manages to still stay tense by some well-handled editing that cuts rapidly to suspicious eyes and hands nearing pistols. It's a great ending, and certainly one of the coolest of all time.Also worth noting is Ennio Morricone's score. The opening theme is still classic even after thirty-eight years have gone by, and \"Ecstasy of Gold\" (the song playing as The Ugly runs across the cemetery searching frantically for the grave) is nothing short of swelling. The whole score plays like a tumbleweed rolling across a sandy town.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Sergio Leone's Evocative Spaghetti Western", "date": "2005-03-13T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1038562", "sentiment score": [0.0279, 0.217, 0.404, 0.3007, 0.0503]}, {"content": "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly is without a shred of doubt absolutely one of the greatest Westerns ever made and very, very few can even come close. In fact, it is among the greatest films ever made and I can only think of 2 other Westerns that can even compare.Brilliant in every respect, the film is original, tense, very gritty, and very atmospheric. Throughout the film there is an incredible energy and sense of tension that suddenly mounts tremendously to a breaking point in the finale. The film, outstanding the entire way through, is pure magic from the moment Tuco stumbles upon the cemetery until the very end. In a short period of time, this last portion of the movie crams in the incredible scene where Tuco looks around to see the immense number of graves before searching for the treasure, and the extremely tense, gripping, and unusual three-way stand-off in which the tension becomes almost unbearable before the sudden, unexpected, and powerfully anti-climactic (if that makes sense) shootout.The cinematography is creative and artistic. It powerfully helps convey the moods of the events and adds tremendously to the feeling of tension. As usual, Leone made the film with extreme care and artistry, combining his \"trademark\" tight close-ups and huge longshots, sometimes, with incredibly stunning visual results, in the exact same shot (as near the end when we see a close-up of Tuco's gun and his hand slowly inching down toward it, while the bulk of the view is a longshot of the cemetery with another of the gunmen in the distance).The characters are fresh, entertaining, and beautifully portrayed. Lee van Cleef, Eli Wallach, and Clint Eastwood are all perfect in their roles, imbuing their characters with immense realism and personality while emphasizing their differences and their similarities. Lee van Cleef emphatically shows how good and versatile an actor he could be, despite the fact that he far too rarely got such big roles. After compellingly portraying the utterly sympathetic colonel in For A Few Dollars More, he is entirely convincing as a terribly ruthless baddie. Clint is great as the taciturn Blondie and gets in some great, convincing gestures, etc. Eli is the most incredible of the lot here as the garrulous, untrustworthy, but likable and sympathetic Tuco, a man boiling with life and quirky humanity who contrasts the other taciturn, calm characters wonderfully.Another element of this film that I love is the great attention to detail, another Leone strong point that pays off in all of his films This is particularly true with respect to the three main characters. So much thought seems to have gone into even the smallest aspects of their personalities, such as how each one carries his gun in a totally different manner. My favorite is probably how Tuco carries his gun stuffed into a pocket and likes to have it simply hang from his lanyard when ready to fight.There is also a wonderful sense of humour and I love how this pops up to break the tension even at unexpected moments like the cemetery and the final shootout. I also want to comment on Leone's handling of violence. His films certainly are violent in the sheer number of deaths (compare The man Who Shot Liberty Valance, where I remember only 1 person being killed), adding a grittiness to the films and making them less idealized and romantic. At the same time, Leone's scenes of death are quick and sharp, with most of the time spent on building the tension beforehand. I actually think that this not only makes a much more interesting picture with greater tension and less gore than something done by, say, Sam Peckinpah, but the quickness of the deaths actually is more brutal in a way than a drawn-out death. It hits home the cheapness and fragility of life in a way that a long, bloody death never can. Finally, Ennio Morricone's music is utterly perfect. It's brilliant and perfectly helps convey all the drama, tension, and general atmosphere of the film in the right ways at the right times. I don't think there has ever been a better score for a Western.This is one film that I can watch over and over, every time enjoying every little detail. One of the most amazing things, and one which really hits home Leone's incredible ability as a filmmaker, is how Leone can take this genre, and what is really a very simple story, and produce a film that goes far beyond what might normally have been with the film, turning it into a real piece of art and something far grander and more powerful than it otherwise would have been in the hands of other filmmakers.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Arguably the Greatest Western Ever Made", "date": "2005-03-11T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1037299", "sentiment score": [0.0053, 0.0116, 0.0217, 0.2469, 0.7145]}, {"content": "I'm not going to repeat all the other reviews about this spectacular movie.

Maybe I am too sentimental - but when they fulfill the dying captain's wish and blow up the bridge - the feeling is simply overwhelming.Further, the dramatic scenery emphasized the suffering of these soldiers in this desolate area - far from any news coverage, recognition or glory. The \"Good, Bad and the Ugly\" chose to live there and be part of that land. The soldiers were sent there by superiors who had no knowledge of the land or cared what took place. Certainly the equivalent of \"All Quiet on the Western Front\" in showing the horror and waste of war.------------------ How good is this movie?

His westerns include the 'spaghetti' trilogy and the very impressive 'Once upon a time in the West'. He also orchestrated a fascinating and enjoyable film later on in the 80's with 'Once upon a time in America'. These are a few of his films and all were very entertaining with their complex and intricate story lines. The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is no exception, as we venture into the dry and sandy landscape (filmed in Spain), the characters each find themselves caught in the firing line of the Civil War. Leone has focused on this as he clearly opposed and disliked the war (he felt it was wrong and unjust)and he makes an effort to portray the Civil War as meaningless and conflicting with what should be progression for America. Aside from the political aspect of the film we find a superb story that tells a tale of how three rogue individuals cross paths while searching for a prize more than any 'Wanted' poster could bore. The sum of $200,000 requires all three to form some kind of co - operation and, despite the tense conflict, we are led along their paths to the breathtaking finale where we see the last dance of death between the three gunslingers. Hugely entertaining with its slick dialogue and vast yet intriguing surroundings, we find ourselves in the mist of ferocious gun fights between enemies and old foes.

Not to take anything away from John Ford, but Leone brought a style to audiences in his \"spaghetti westerns\" that no one else could have thought possible. He stays true to the rugged, gritty feel of American westerns, but his obvious inspiration from Kurosawa's samurai films, and Leone's own personal style come together in a fascinating way that I feel is too individualistic for anyone else to have created. The characters in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly seem so alive, so rich and developed. It all seems so real that watching this can make you feel like you have stumbled upon another world, and certainly, another way of life, that has been going on forever, and will continue on long after you have left. Clint Eastwood's iconic performance as Blondie is brilliant. His unflinching confidence in every move he makes tells you right away that this is not a man to be trifled with. He never cracks under pressure, and he seems to have such a tight grasp of every situation that one would be a fool NOT to side with him. Blondie is every bit as cool, calm, and collected as Humphrey Bogart's Sam Spade in the Maltese Falcon, and also every bit as rewarding to watch! Lee Van Cleef is menacing as Angel Eyes, a bounty hunter who gives the impression that he never met a man who could come close to making him feel threatened. Then, there is Tuco, played by Eli Wallach. Tuco, as dastardly as he is, serves as the comic relief, which is important in a film like this that is filled with tension (the montage in the cemetery is classic!).

Boasts an unforgettable Morricone score, a typically charismatic performance from Clint Eastwood and stately direction from the master of the genre, Sergio Leone With A Fistful of Dollars (1964), Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone gave birth to the spaghetti western. So it is appropriate that he should take the helm for the quintessential example of the genre with this, the best and last of the Dollars trilogy (after 1965's For A Few Dollars More).Anti-epic, brutal and displaying an often overlooked gallows humour, The Good, The Bad And The Ugly centres on the aptly described protagonists. Eastwood (The Man With No Name - other than 'Blondie', or the Good), Van Cleef (Angel Eyes, or the Bad) and Wallach (Tuco, or the Ugly) are the three degrees of moral ambiguity searching Civil War-torn America for a buried payroll.In truth, however, the plot is incidental to the film's appeal. The spectacularly bleak landscapes, Morricone's cheekily melodramatic score, and the physical interplay between the leading men all contribute to the film's (and Eastwood's) iconic status.The finale's showdown is an inspired set-piece of sweaty tension and invention that has been blatantly lifted by directors all over the world from Woo to Tarantino.

Not only does Sergio Leone in close cooperation with Ennio Morricone and his groundbreaking score manage to create a masterpiece of modern movie history. He also revolutionizes the Western by shifting the clean and glorified image of the west that existed so far and changing it into a dirty, often ugly and very brutal face. Furthermore he underlines some of the motives that kept this era going as they do today. Greed, violence and the absolute fight for survival and sometimes the strongest one revenge (which is a dominant factor in his movie Once Upon a Time in the West). However his characters which carry this movie all along give it a much more human and realistic feel. Lee van Clef, Clint Eastwood and above all Eli Walach make their characters become very vivid and the viewers sometimes catch themselves identify with them although they probably would not have expected it earlier. The twists and turns that bring the characters into situations that no one would have expected moments earlier are truly what life is all about; you never know what will happen the next moment. With a little twist of fate (and it twists a lot in this movie) the character that is on top on the one moment is the one who looks into a barrel of a gun the very next moment. The allegories that Leone uses in his move seem almost endless. Let's mention just two examples. The truly inspired and masterful invention of the amphitheatric setting of the cemetery which has a center stage that is surrounded by crosses and almost looks lice an ancient theater. It is there where Tuco, the Ugly (who is notably the most \"human\" character in this movie) runs full of anticipation like a little child trying to find a familiar face. However he just searches for the grave that contains what everybody is hunting after in this movie, the treasure. It almost seems like the dead are watching these three characters as they aspire to become rich or ... just become another cross in this cemetery. Inside this \"arena\" the final shootout takes place with Leone producing an editing with his ultra close ups that are breathtaking. In this theatrical surrounding the high point of the story (that has elements of an ancient drama) is reached. Another really astonishing moment is the final scene with Tuco, his neck in a rope, balancing on a cross with 100.000 $ in gold dollars lying before him but he is not able to do anything with that money since he is on the verge between life and death and all the money on earth not being able to help him. A truly ironic picture and Leone manages to produce a lot of such irony in his movie. Before the liberating shoot from the Good (played by Clint Eastwood who almost acts as a character who is responsible for divine justice) that cuts the rope, the viewer is for a moment exposed to the paradox of life and death.This movie is an absolute must see!

This 3rd movie centering on the Man with No Name (not exactly true, but its catchy) was the 1st that Leone got the inimitable Ennio Morricone to score from the outset, and that score has such an impact there's no doubt it has a lot to do with TGTBTU's attraction through almost 40 years. It really sticks with you! This Ultimate Spaghetti Western was also elevated by a bigger budget and much stronger screen presence of its principal characters. Eastwood, Wallach and Van Cleef are true screen legends, competing any which way they can for the stolen bags of gold, culminating in the most famous gunfight in moviedom.I also rate Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West a 10.

The additions were good overall; for the most part the story flowed better but there was some unnecessary fluff. The 2nd disc has some good featurettes that include some modern commentary by Eastwood and Wallach, a little documentary on the Civil War backdrop, trailers, and even a couple of deleted scenes!

The movie also contains a deeper message, concerning the cruelty of war and the value of the human life. Although the small-budget film-making, like in the two previous movies of the dollars-trilogy, has its own attraction, director Sergio Leone really shows what he's made of this time. There are some epic war scenes, huge explosions and realistic sets, that Leone no doubt could have been able to make with the minimal budget of A Fistful of Dollars.The movie is set sometime in the American Civil War. As before, Clint Eastwood stars. He's the man with no name, which is this time named Blondie. He still doesn't talk very much and he'll still do anything for a fistful of dollars. Although he's namely the Good he's not really a hero you can look up to. In fact he's only the least bad of the three main characters, who are all greedy and ruthless men, who are prepared to kill anyone who stands in their way. The Ugly is Blondie's best friend, partner in crime and also the worst enemy. He's the Mexican bandit named Tuco. Eli Wallach is wonderful as Tuco, he almost steals the show from Clint, being a cruel, stupid, vengeful, greedy, two-faced, but somehow also a very lovable character. The same can't be said about the Bad, the assassin Angel Eyes, who is played by the greatest of western crooks, Lee van Cleef. He's a ruthless man, who'll not only kill a wanted man, but also his family and take their money when he only needed to get was one name. When he gets paid, he'll kill his employer, because he reckons, the previous body wanted to hire him to do so. Angel Eyes also works as a deputy leader of a southern POW camp. He's almost the complete opposite of Col. Mortimer from A Few Dollars More. They are on different sides of the war, but the southern colonel is a much more honorable man.The movie contains an anti-war message. Although the Civil War only seems to be the set-up for the gold hunt which covers the movie's plot, war is criticized all the time. The POW camp could as well be a concentration camp, as prisoners get beaten near death as the choir is forced to sing, so the voices of the beating couldn't be heard. You are put to the camp for simply rooting for the wrong side. Also watching a big fight at the river, the usually very little-talking Blondie notes that he's never seen men wasted so badly. Later he even gives his coat and cigar to a dying soldier. He seems to be the only character in the movie capable of some sort of empathy. Who would've thought!The modern action film directors should take a good look at the Good, the Bad and the Ugly (some do, but to no avail). At least many movie villains should remember Tuco's unforgettable line: \"When you got to shoot, shoot, don't talk!\"***** (10/10 The top ten movies I've seen #4)The best part (Major SPOILER): Many to choose from, but there's never been a dual scene quite like the one at the cemetery in the end. While Ennio Morricone's wonderful music plays, the camera goes around to show us the whole scenery and Tuco's and Angel Eyes's emotions (Blondie is so calm I can't really say the same about him).

The plot is very good, intricate, yet simple enough for the mainstream crowd; the way it keeps developing through twists and unexpected situations is also great. It keeps your interest, at least the first few times you see it. The pace is bad in some scenes, where the movie seems to drag on endlessly. I don't think I've been able to sit through the whole thing more than once(granted, technically that's enough, but a film should have some re-watch value, I think). The acting is very good; Clint Eastwood is the embodiment of the spaghetti-western spirit. Lee Van Cleef is excellent as well, as is Eli Wallach. The characters are well-written, interesting and credible. The direction is, as always when it comes to Leone's films, excellent.

I recommend it to any fan of westerns, particularly spaghetti-westerns, as well as any of the three main actors, or Sergio Leone. 9/10", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 4}, "heading": "A great western, but drags a little too much, especially on repeated viewings", "date": "2004-09-27T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0092864", "sentiment score": [0.0062, 0.0656, 0.3859, 0.5052, 0.0371]}, {"content": "As such, it's impossible for me to be objective about it: I've seen it (in it's entirety or bits and pieces of it) about 30 times, and every time I see it I notice something new. I saw it recently at a local revival house. This was the first time I ever saw it in a theater and the movie, I'm convinced, really needs to be seen on the big screen to be properly appreciated: Leone sets up some really masterful compositions, but you need a big screen to appreciate them (I'm thinking of the stand-off in the cemetery and the final ride in particular, although there are many such moments).This time through I was particularly struck by Wallach's performance as Tuco, \"The Ugly\". Easily the best thing Wallach ever did, he lifts the movie, and it's usually in the little things: robbing a store owner but at the last minute giving him back his bottle of whiskey, the pink parasol he's carrying as he goes through the desert with Blondie, brushing his teeth with bathwater. Through such small little gestures Wallach gives you a character who's sort of the Id principle gone wrong: he's all Life, but a spoiled sort of Life. I saw the restored version. Personally, as a long-time fan of the movie, while I was glad to have the scenes added it didn't alter my opinion of the movie at all: the new scenes are very small, and mostly add small amounts of plot information.There's always a few people who haven't seen anything.

It is ironic that, at the time the three Sergio Leone westerns were released, they were largely panned by critics as being poor and even laughable imitations of American-made westerns. The fact that they were filmed in Italy and Spain resulted in them receiving their amusing nickname which was intended to degrade them at the time.Somehow, over the quarter century or so since their release, the critics have tended to change their opinions, and now these movies are generally regarded as classics. Perhaps this is because Clint Eastwood was principally known only as the second banana, Rowdy Yates, in the television series \"Rawhide\" when the films were produced but since then has achieved superstardom. But I also think it goes beyond that. I believe the critics decided to take another look at these films and realized that they had been premature in writing them off. Actually, I believe the three films were considerably better than most of what Hollywood produced. In fact, I think that TGTBATU ranks among the best westerns ever produced bringing to mind the magnificent films of John Ford, the undisputed master of that genre, and his protege, the incomparable John Wayne. I have nothing but praise for this film. In fact, I rank it as one of my favorite films of all time. I could write volumes of what is good about this film. But since its qualities have been oft repeated in other viewer reviews, I will focus on what others didn't like about it. Most of the IMDb reviews had only one major complaint: the film is too long. I disagree. In fact, in spite of its nearly three hour length, I was disappointed that it ended. I was so absorbed in the film that I was disheartened to have to return to reality. The combination of story, cinematography, acting and musical score left nothing to be desired other than more of the same! The sequences that seemed to drag on in the opinion of other reviewers were necessary to fully create moods and to drive home important points. For example, the opening sequence might be regarded as needlessly long as Angel Eyes taunts a hapless man over a leisurely meal. But to me, scenes like that are what makes the movie great! The time allows the viewer to fully appreciate the amazing replication of the primitive home and the pitiful life of its dirt-poor inhabitants. I felt as though I was sitting there at the table; I was half tempted to reach for a bowl and spoon to partake of the meal. And all the while the suspense was building towards the inevitable climax. You know it's coming but not when and the length of the scene drives you crazy but makes it all the more satisfying when it does happen. Another example is when Tuco punishes Joe by forcing him to walk through the desert. This is possibly the only time that one might become bored with the film. But again, I think the time for the scene was justified in that we are able to receive the full impact of that experience and enjoy the haunting music at the same time. Joe's subsequent predicament might not have had much credibility had this sequence been abbreviated. In my opinion, one of the essential elements of a great film is creating moods that absorb our attention. This often takes time, lots of time. For example, many of the scenes in the magnificent film \"Dr. Zhivago\" were almost painfully long but they were necessary to create those startling surrealistic moods, and the film would not have been great without them. In many ways, TGTBATU has this same sort of greatness. It is a sweeping epic with very compelling characters and magnificent settings that draws the viewer in and doesn't release him until the closing credits begin to roll. When it's over, you feel that you've been on a long and exciting journey. Such a journey takes time.In summary, if you haven't seen this film, buy it right away.

I'm not all too educated in the Western genre, but supposedly this is the best, so I figured it to be a good place to start. Absolutely stunning cinematography technique, excellent characters and actors, and one of the most memorable musical scores ever help define TGTBATU's spot in film history. It's no wonder it's achieved the status it has. Having never seen any of the old spaghetti westerns before, I really didn't know what to expect. I was surprised but also delighted. For some reason I thought this film was going to be extremely realistic, so I was a little surprised to see hats getting shot off and rope cut in half by a bullets. I suppose it is part of the genre's characteristics and probably takes a little getting used to. Also, at the same time the film is very realistic as it introduces the theme of the Civil War at different parts throughout the film giving us a small glimpse of it's effects back then.\nEasily my favorite component to the film, the cinematography is simply amazing. Panoramic backgrounds and extreme close-ups do their respective jobs quite nicely to give this film more character that it needs, which is not a bad thing. I'm sure it's played a huge part in the film's notoriety and support since it's release. The score and the well-cast actors obviously had a part in this also. Oh yeah, and one more thing, Clint Eastwood...born for these parts.Being new to the genre of Spaghetti Westerns, I offer up my criticism with much reluctance. For the record, I enjoyed the film quite a bit and was not disappointed. However, I was a little surprised to find the film rated so high, even if it is the genre-defining classic that it is. What's wrong with it? Well, it's a tad too long for one. Not that I can't stay interested, I just felt they could have cut a few of the scenes. Also, while the cinematography is beautiful, and complimented by long shots, I feel these longs shots are sometimes a little too long. The cemetery and stand-off scenes in the end come to mind. They're wonderful sequences, just too long. It's not that big of a deal, just sensing a little pretension leaking out here and there. And lastly, the sound quality is fairly terrible, even if the score is decent. The quality makes it sound like everyone was in a cave, including the impressive score. I do realize that the film was dubbed...some of which isn't all that great, which explains some of the off-key lip movements from some of the characters, some of them English speaking. Other than those three little gripes, that may not have been such forty years ago, this is a great film that I enjoyed immensely. I will definitely add it to my collection soon and continue my quest to see all of the great Westerns.

This film makes the previous two pale in comparison, not only in it's duration but on its grandiose and panoramic scale.With an exiting plot and battle scenes which would make Sir David Lean green with envy, Leone pushed the Italian western boat out further than it had ever been before. If Leone's association with Clint Eastwood was to come to an end, then this was the high note for it to have ended on.Eastwood plays our favourite anti-hero yet again, this time showing more humane sides to his personality, for instance the comfort he gives a dying soldier in his last few minutes of life and the fact that besides his life of killing, he is not beyond sitting down and stroking a kitten.Lee Van Cleef, the veteran of many B westerns of the fifties and of Leone's second No Name yarn, plays Angel-eyes (the Bad) and he is evil to the extremes. Brutality and violence seems the key to his whole character and he plays it so well.Wallach is out-standing as Tuco (the Ugly) and practically steals the whole film. His character is completely without morals or scruples and seems to have the longest criminal record in history. It is the interaction with Eastwood's character that makes this film so entertaining.In the beginning, Tuco and No Name have formed an uneasy partnership to the effect that No Name catches the wanted felon, turns him in for the reward money, rescues him from the noose where-after the money is split and the same system is worked in the next town with equal success. This provides a few entertaining scenes between the two which rival most conventional \"buddy\" movies.However, when they learn of a cache of hidden gold the two reform their reluctant partnership in their efforts to find it. This is purely because Wallach knows the name of the graveyard in which the gold is buried and Eastwood knows the name of the grave it is buried under.Add to this Cleef's interest in the hidden gold and his murderous ways of getting to it and provide a setting as bloody as the American Civil War, you have an exiting film full of gun-play and double-crosses, that is both original and unique.It is certainly the most bloodthirsty of the three movies and is at times horrific in it's violence. For instance, the scenes where systematic beatings are administered to the Confederate prisoners. If these images aren't graphic enough, the soft mellow music being played in the background is in such stark contrast to the action, you sense the suffering and pain more.I think my favourite scene in any film has to be Eli Wallach running around the gigantic graveyard looking for the one grave he suspects hides the fortune. Accompanied by Ennio Morricone's now famous score and fantastic spinning camera angles, this scene is movie making at it's best and everything the cinema was created for.I think it would be hard to find anyone on this planet who has not seen this film, but if you haven't do so NOW.

And I can tell you now-Tarantino wasn't wrong! A Fistful Of Dollars and For A Few Dollars More are excellent films in their own right, but The Good, The Bad And The Ugly is more than just an excellent film-it is a major artistic achievement. The reasons for this permeate every aspect of the film.Starting with the obvious, the acting is wonderful, both on the parts of the actors themselves and also the voice artists. Clint Eastwood has come under some criticism for his supposedly \"wooden\" portrayal of the Man With No Name, but the character description is of a laconic, taciturn mystery man and there's only so much you can do with that. Lee Van Cleef is one of the coolest and scariest villains of all time, while Eli Wallach's \"lovable rogue\" portrayal of the Mexican bandit Tuco makes a welcome change from the \"psychopathic killer\" that Gian Maria Volonte had played in the two prequels. Special mention at this point goes to the voice artist used to dub the scenes starring Lee Van Cleef that weren't dubbed while he was still alive, having been added for the Special Edition. He gets the voice absolutely spot on. Also of note is the alcoholic Union Captain who strikes the perfect balance between wry humour and despair.The cinematography is breathtaking. Leone's trademark style was to mix extreme close ups with extreme long shots, which is taken to a spectacular extreme here and gives the film a huge sense of scale. The very first shot of the film, in fact, is both a close up and a long shot at the same time. The faces Leone chooses to zoom in on are, shall we say, interesting to look at, as well. While the build up to scenes of violence is long and intense, the violence itself is for the most part short and sharp. The film is therefore extremely tense. The one extended scene of violence, Tuco's torture, is transformed by the juxtaposition of the orchestra playing a slow lament outside-the sight of the young musician crying in the knowledge of what is happening behind closed doors is a haunting moment. The rather flashy cinematography comes to a head at the film's climax in the graveyard, culminating in the single most perfect shot in cinema history. I won't reveal it as I loathe spoilers, but it's there.Good scenes are made better by a wonderful score by the ever-dependable Ennio Morricone. The rousing 'Ecstasy Of Gold' transforms Tuco's sprint through the graveyard into a scene so beautiful it hurts, and 'The Trio' does the same for the climax. As for the title theme...well, everyone's heard it so I won't waste time talking about it, except to say that even if you thought you hated it you'll end up loving it. Ennio Morricone stated that he tried to reflect the film's \"larger-than-life\" quality. Indeed, there are some moments that are somewhat surreal. These range from the obvious (\"the good\", \"the bad\" and \"the ugly\" appearing in brightly coloured letters next to the characters' faces) to the subtle (the insane fight over the bridge and the state of the soldiers). The film is at the same time unreal and grittily realistic, to great effect.Several questions have been asked about the film. Firstly, there is the question of whether or not Clint Eastwood plays the same character throughout all three films. I say no: looking at it like that causes continuity problems. Plus, if Eastwood is the same character in all three films, then what about the other actors who appeared in the other films like Lee Van Cleef, Luigi Pistilli and especially Mario Brega, who dies in all three films? \"The Man With No Name\" is a marketing exercise, post-modernism before the term was invented. One thing I do agree with is the softening of Eastwood's character-although you have to do more than play with a kitten to come across as a goodie in my book, the tending to a dying soldier and the famous quotation \"never seen so many men wasted so badly\" make Blondie much more human than either Joe or Monco. Also, some have said that the film is a Christian allegory. There are scenes to support this, such as the prisoner being made to carry his coffin to his place of execution, but these scenes are unconnected both to each other and to the main plot and thus this claim is a somewhat dubious one. The film has entered my top ten at number two, not quite dislodging Pulp Fiction. Nevertheless, it is a beautiful piece of work and anyone who worked on it should feel justly proud.

He gets himself a partner, a silent type named Blondie (Clint Eastwood), and they go into business collecting bounties for Tuco and skipping town until Blondie leaves Tuco in the desert, vowing revenge. Meanwhile, weasel-eyed nasty Angeleyes (Lee Van Cleef) is hot on the trail of a fellow going by the name of Carson, part of the Confederate Army of the West, who knows something about $200,000 in gold coin. Meanwhile, all around, the American Civil War rages on.Rest assured this all comes together, in a way that feels as natural as sunshine on a dog's bottom. The arresting thing about this film is how fresh and clever the journey is in getting there. It's not just cinema, but mega-cinema, the way every scene flows effortlessly into the next, while not one frame feels tired or overused. One worries a little about the new DVD that adds 20 minutes of footage. You can't improve on perfection. But the fact that this movie was ruthlessly edited after its Italian premiere for U.S. distribution suggests that this might be the one time a classic is actually improved on by such additions.It's the ultimate guy's movie. There's not even a trace of a romance, unless you count Carson's whore. But it's a very philosophical film, too, even sensitive in a cleverly perverse way. The title, really one of the best movie titles ever, sets up an interesting premise that we see delivered in corkscrew fashion in the movie. Sure, Angeleyes is bad, and Tuco ugly in his morally conflicted manner, shooting people in cold blood and then making the sign of the cross as if to appease divine judgment. But Blondie as good? When we first see him, he's murdering three bounty hunters who just captured an outlaw and were preparing to bring him to justice. His treatment of Tuco, however enjoyable in its sadistically jolly way, is not good in any sense of the word.But we do see growth in this man of few words, a sense of appreciation for the moral stands life allows us to take. He is concerned enough to ask about Tuco's fate in his first encounter with Angeleyes, and by the end of the movie, we've seen him show real concern for the senseless victims of war. The film works by throwing up a hard-edged tone of cruelty it never lets go of, but there's an undertone that posits something better, which leads to a conclusion that is one of filmdom's best.What else is great? What isn't? Every line is a classic, especially Tuco's, like \"There are two kinds of spurs, my friend...\" and \"If you're going to shoot, shoot, don't talk.\" There are some welcome faces from other parts of the Dollars trilogy, especially the indefatigable heavy Mario Brega as Corporal Wallace, who has one of the nastiest moments (beating Tuco) and then one of its funniest (when Tuco complains \"I can't while you're watching\" while trying to relieve himself in the boxcar).It's impossible to overstate how good a movie this is. The only negative is that it's too long, but that very same quality is what makes it so enjoyable to watch over again. It's not even my favorite Sergio Leone film (that would be \"For A Few Dollars More\"), but it's not only his best film, it's one of the best films ever made.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "An Italian Opera You Won't Nod Off To", "date": "2004-05-13T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0092843", "sentiment score": [0.0171, 0.1664, 0.4677, 0.3191, 0.0298]}, {"content": "I first saw this film in 1968 in Sydney, I was 18.

Taking place around the Civil War, the film revolves around three men, The Good in Blondie (Clint Eastwood), The Bad in Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) and The Ugly in Tuco (Eli Wallach). All three men have knowledge about a grave of gold and the uneasy alliances formed to achieve their goal in retrieving the cash is what the film is about. \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" is sometimes touted as the pinacle in Leone's career but this film is where he will be remembered. Nearly every scene in this film is a classic and defines everything about Leone's skills, talents and his style of directing and story telling. Cinematography is excellent with gritty locations and vast green landscapes capturing the screen. Performances are perfect with Wallach leading the way, playing a character who is not just the film's comic point but a complete character and not just someone to laugh at to loosen tension. Eastwood's Man With No Name (he adopts Blondie) shows new depth to his acting and his delivery never falters, playing a character now iconic. Lastly Van Cleef plays Angel Eyes in one of the best villain turns in history. Memorable, slick and chilling he is a person you struggle to hold your nerve around, Cleef holds the character together and with little screen time shows what an effect he can have on an audience. Characters in a Leone film are people you will never forget, lines, stances, the eyes. Characters very core are not left exposed and stay with you. Morricone is genius in music and his most memorable score is here, I think \"Once Upon a Time in America\" is his best score but this is his most unforgettable and has the greatest theme in any picture. Morricone is a man on par with Leone for excellence and does the film credit. Now onto the greatest achievment, the directing. Sergio Leone made in total about seven films, this stands as his best in his field. Some directors take in favour style over substance or vice versa, Leone takes both into maximum consideration and is why his films are unique. What you see is as important as what you hear, this applies to viewers who dislike his observing technique. Leone respects the viewer and entices them in every scene to be a part of the action on screen. \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\" has that great quality, the acting is perfect, the writing is perfect, the cinematography, sets, sound, editing and directing I can honestly say this film does not lack and is cinimatically perfect.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Film making perfection", "date": "2004-05-03T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0092841", "sentiment score": [0.0033, 0.0125, 0.0536, 0.5072, 0.4233]}, {"content": "Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone OWN the \"American\" Western.

So we turned to film.So why is it that until \"Unforgiven\" won the Oscar in '92, the American Western had all but disappeared from mainstream film? Some might tell you that sci-fi took its place (\"Space, the final frontier\"). Others might say that we simply lost interest in the subject.

But that's part of what makes his performance so impressive.

There's something in The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly that's nearly (or perhaps is) mythical in it's craft, certain scenes come off as being more than relevant and exquisite for that scene/sequence- it transcends into aspects of humanity.For example, in the first part of the film (this is after the extraordinary introductions to Tuco, played by Eli Wallach, Sentenza or 'Angel Eyes', played by Lee Van Cleef, and as Blondie by a 35/36 year old Clint), Joe gets Tuco out of a hanging, which is something of a regular practice for them, but Joe decides to leave his 'buddy' out in the desert to walk the rest of the way back into town. A little later, the situation gets reversed, as Tuco has a horse and water and Joe doesn't, and they both go to cross the desert. Leone decides to not follow Tuco coming back to town as much as he follows in earnest Tuco and Joe going across that desert, as Joe starts to burn and dry up, going towards a story that will soon unfold. There is something to these scenes that I can barely describe, that they're executed in the mind-set of a Western, but in the abstract Leone lets the audience know this is a story that is bold and bigger than life.What makes much of the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly such a huge success is the trust Leone had in his own style he spun into his own after the first two westerns, his trust in his collaborators, and in his leading players as well. I, for one, had to mistakenly figure out that it is near depressing to watch this film on a regular VCR tape due to the pan & scan process. There is such a clear, distinct visual scope that Leone and camera director Tonino Delli Colli achieve that it's practically a must to get the DVD (preferably the extended version, which was Leone's original cut more or less). The editing, too, is unique in many sequences (the climax is the most noted and memorable). The score, with usual collaborator Ennio Morricone, is one of the landmark movie scores, and themes, of not just in the western genre but in all movie history. And the three main players who take on the screen have their own chops to show off: Eastwood, technically, was playing a Joe that took place before Fistful of Dollars, yet by this film had it down to a T (it's still my favorite performance from him, despite having few words and reactions); Cleef's cold, cunning Angel Eyes steals the scenes he's in; ditto for Wallach, who gets under the skin of his co-patriots as much as he sometimes does under the viewer's. If anyone really stays in the mind, at least for me, it's Wallach - especially as he gets the most 'character', and one of the very best scenes is between Tuco and his religious brother. Without that scene, the movie actually wouldn't work quite as well, surprisingly enough. Overall, The Good, the Bad and Ugly, is an entirely satisfying western, at least one of my five favorites ever made, and it's an endearing bravo to all who were involved.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 200, "votes": 238}, "heading": "Sergio Leone's penultimate Italian-western; a film that gets better with each passing year...", "date": "2004-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0092829", "sentiment score": [0.0293, 0.1253, 0.2377, 0.4469, 0.1608]}, {"content": "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1966/Sergio Leone) **** out of ****There I was, sitting in this filthy theater, looking at my watch, waiting.... Then the lights dim, and that familiar theme song started. Everyone knows it, and has hummed it at least once. I'm talking about the classic theme to \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\". You might not remember it off hand, but you'd know it if you heard it. The screen lights up, and the movie has started. To me, this was the chance of a life time to see such a classic film on the big screen. \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" is about three men searching for gold during the final days of the Civil War. The three men are of course the Good (Clint Eastwood as 'Blondie'), the Bad (Lee Van Cleef as 'Angel Eyes'), and the Ugly (Eli Wallach as 'Tuco'). Blondie and Tuco are two criminals who work together. When they have a falling out, Tuco tries to take revenge on Blondie, but instead, both men accidently find out where $200,000 in gold is buried. At the same time, Angel Eyes is also looking for the gold. Eventually, their paths meet at a POW camp, and that is where the real fun begins. \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" is a prequel to a \"A Fistfull of Dollars\" and \"For a Few Dollars More\". I have seen neither of them, so I can not judge which is the best of the trilogy.\"The Good...\" is probably one of the most entertaining films of all time. From beginning to end, I was glued to the screen, and it being on the big screen helped me enjoy it even more. Unlike Leone's later work, such as \"Once Upon a Time in the West\", this film isn't as slowly paced, and less poetic, but more enjoyable. Although, the Leone trademarks can be found throughout, such as the extreme close-ups, the amazing and famous score, and enough flies to feed a colony of frogs. The performances are amazing. Eastwood is ultra cool, Van Cleef makes a great bad guy, and Wallach is so funny, he steals the show! In fact, I was surprised by the sense of humor the film had. The funniest scene, in my opinion, was when Tuco is trying to read a letter left by Angel Eyes, and he reads it saying, \" 'See you soon, id...\" \"id...\" \"ids...' \", and Eastwood takes the letter and says, \" 'Idiots.' It's for you.\" Maybe it's not as funny written down, but on the big screen, it is laugh-out-loud funny. Another thing about this film that makes it different from Leone's other westerns, is that it just as much a war film as it is a western. It shows the hardships of war from both point of views, which is hard to find in a lot of conventional and mainstream war films.The music is probably my favorite thing about the movie. It plays a powerful role in it. Take for instance the scene in which Tuco finds the graveyard that they have been looking for the whole time. He runs through it, looking for that certain grave containing the gold. If it weren't for the music, and Leone's amazing style, then this scene would be pretty standard. But the music sets the pacing of the film like a train that is slowly accelerating. As the music speeds up, Tuco speeds up. As the music becomes for powerful, Tuco becomes more eager and greedy. This is one of the great scenes of this great movie.In the end, \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" isn't as artful or as operatic as Leone's later \"Once Upon a Time...\" films.

They say that before he even had a written script he could picture exactly what was to be on screen and the camera's direction in leading his characters. It was Sergio's World - an alternate place in an alternate time that he was free to control. He controlled the audience and his story like no other director.To me, his best film was the one that was on many critics' ten worst films of 1984 list: \"Once Upon a Time in America.\" I love the finished director's cut, the cut of the film Sergio Leone himself wanted and pictured in his mind while filming the movie. Unfortunately, the editor of the film cut everything into a two-hour picture and messed up the timeline for the theatrical release in 1984 - the result was a disastrous motion picture that now, with the director's cut, stands as one of the best of all time. James Woods once said that one of the critics who named it the worst film of 1984 later named it the best film of the decade.\"Once Upon a Time in America\" was Sergio's dream project, one that took him ten years to get on the big screen and ultimately killed him by sucking the life out of him, but \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" (1967) was undoubtably his most visual film. The extreme close-ups, the great way he lets the audience see nothing but what he wants - as far as he saw it, the audience should not wonder what is off-screen; whatever is within the frames is all there is. Compared to \"Once Upon a Time\" it seems a bit more corny and unrealistic - but it is a spaghetti western, and that is simply the point. It stands above the rest as the best spaghetti western of them all.Leone is best remembered for his extreme close-ups. Director Quentin Tarantino once said, among many other things about Leone, his role model, that when he started out he knew not many camera directions, so when he wanted an extreme close-up in a film he'd shout, \"I want a Sergio Leone on this guy!\" Quentin Tarantino has such a respect for Leone that he even suggested the title \"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\" to director Robert Rodriguez, the title, of course, a derivation on \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" and \"Once Upon a Time in America,\" both films of Sergio Leone.\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,\" a.k.a. \"Buono, il bruto, il cattivo, il,\" is the final film in the Dollars Trilogy - \"A Fistful of Dollars,\" \"For a Few Dollars More,\" and, of course, \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.\" I have yet to see this film's predecessors, but I doubt they are much better than this film. It isn't really about anything per se - it's a showcase of art and camera techniques. It is a showcase for Sergio Leone and a great one at that. I have no real care about the themes or outcomes - I simply enjoy being controlled by a masterful director such as Leone. When there's a director who can literally push in and give the audience specifically what he wants them to see, without the audience feeling cheated, you know you have a great director, because there's a fine line between a selfish director and a visionary director. Leone has a bit of both, so indistinct that it is hard to notice. The same thing was done in Carol Reed's \"The Third Man\" (1949), and the same is done here. And it is pulled off without any objections from the audience.Clint Eastwood is The Good - he rides around the desert kidnapping criminals, giving them to the authorities and claiming reward money, and then freeing the criminals before they are to be hanged. He meets Tuco (Eli Wallach), a.k.a. The Ugly, and does his routine - but The Ugly fights back and, ultimately, kidnaps good ol' Clint, taking him into the desert and practically torturing him in the heat.Then The Good overhears where a stash of gold is hidden from a dying man. The Ugly wants the gold so much that he nurses The Good back to health so that they can go off on a wild goose chase and search for the treasure. But there is already another man searching for the treasure - Angel Eyes, a.k.a. The Bad (Lee Van Cleef), a man whose skills at gunfighting match those of The Good, a true marksman if ever there was such a thing.There's a terrific scene towards the end of \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,\" where three men have found the gold buried in a graveyard. At exactly the same time. They each have guns pointed at each other. They could all pull their triggers and die, or kill one of the three and the two could then take the money and split it. Leone zooms in with his extreme close-ups and truly gives the audience a sense of paranoia, a sense of what it would feel like in a circumstance such as that. Sergio Leone is a great director, perhaps the most visionary of all time, and now that his films are turning up again with their intended running times, the realization strikes and sinks in.He's an even better director than we thought he was.5/5 stars -John Ulmer", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 43, "votes": 55}, "heading": "Sergio Leone's most visionary film...", "date": "2003-10-03T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0092811", "sentiment score": [0.0824, 0.1583, 0.1517, 0.3233, 0.2844]}, {"content": "Growing up, there are certain things that you identify with, perhaps sounds, images, or smells; things that make you smile. For me, the one thing that does it all the time, is the musical score for \"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly\". Every time I hear it, all I can think about is Eli Wallach's great grin, Clint Eastwood's stoic gaze, and Lee Van Cleef's evil eyes. All in great fun, Director Sergio Leone's western epic marked the high point for this genre, and showed that you could do a classy movie in which the leading characters do awful things such as: 1) Double-cross each other constantly; 2) Kill more than their share of men; 3) Condone greed at its fullest form.\nThe movie has the three main characters, Eastwood, a.k.a. \"Blondie\", as The Good (if you can consider him the good guy in this role), Wallach, a.k.a. \"Tuco\", as The Ugly, and Van Cleef, a.k.a. \"Angel Eyes\", as The Bad. All three of them are going after the gold, as Blondie and Tuco, while they were settling some scores between them, happened to have a casual meeting with a moribund soldier, who told them about it, and head in one of the most entertaining journeys in cinematic history. The fact that Leone chose the Civil War as the backdrop for his story, only created a sort of \"irony\", as there they were, young American men dying for something that they believed in, and here we have our three main characters weaseling their way through one of the battles, in order to get the gold. Truly classic!!!!The score by Ennio Morricone is in itself a main character of the movie, and it really creates that familiarity that every movie needs to have, in order to make a connection with its audience. The showdown at the end of the movie, has got to be one of the best climax moments ever shot, and ever seen on film (I only wonder how it never makes it into any of Clint Eastwood's highlight reels, during the ceremonies where they salute him). And the ending of the movie, only glorifies it more for its fans.I have to say, having watched more movies than I count in my lifestyle, that \"The Good, The Bad & The Ugly\" is one of the Top 5 films that I have ever seen. The movie runs over two and a half hours, and I have seen it over 20 times, yet, it never gets old. This is a true gem, and one movie that is worth watching, if only because it carries the tag of \"THE BEST WESTERN EVER FILMED\".

Van Cleef murders anyone for money. There a rather spirited bunch. From their on the experience becomes tedious and very slow. There are some great set-pieces including a battle on a bridge involving hundreds of extras, and the standoff at the end is excellently done, with extreme close-ups that heighten the tension.

It does lead to some 'Good-Ugly' relationship humour which is where most of the film gets it's laughs.

Clint Eastwood and Eli Wallach are such a great duo. Eastwood is aloof and laid back while Wallach is emotional and over-the-top. This led to so many classic scenes and one-liners. For example, in the graveyard Tuco is frantically digging with his hands to get to the gold. Then Eastwood appears, tosses a shovel at Tuco, and calmly says \"It'll be a lot easier with that.\"Lee Van Cleef plays the villian as well as it can be played. His introduction with the three murders and his \"When I'm paid, I always see the job through\" line was classic.The use of the civil war was brilliant. The Civil War was by far the most disastrous and devastating time in American history, but to Tuco, Blondie, and Angel Eyes it's just something to exploit and use to their advantage in pursuit of gold. The movie also made a nice anti-war statement without going overboard.The soundtrack is the best in cinema history. The opening theme immediately established that the movie was going to be something special. The theme and variations of it greatly added to the movie. Ecstasy of Gold is an absolute masterpiece, perfectly capturing Tuco's manic exhilaration at finally getting to the graveyard. The sad and laidback music during the war perfectly fit the scenes. The climatic gunfight could have never been pulled off without it's dramatic and perfected arranged music.There were hardly any women and no romance in the movie. That greatly added to the toughness and grittiness of the film. Blondie, Tuco, and Angel Eyes had no emotional dependacy on anyone, which is one of the main reasons why all three characters were so fantastic. 10/10", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "It Doesn't Get Any Better Than This", "date": "2003-09-04T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0092803", "sentiment score": [0.0017, 0.0021, 0.0044, 0.0648, 0.927]}, {"content": "Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Eli Wallach contribute excellent performances as they both end up going up against each other.

Instead, he is concerned about the camera and the music. Ennio Morricone, a genius in his own right, was seriously ignored by the Academy for his compilation here--certainly one of the Top 10 ever. He understands the crude editing of the mid-60s and exploits everything he can from the vision onscreen.

Modern filmmakers should study this before they try emulating MTV next time.

Perhaps only High Noon understands the value of pacing and what to reveal/not reveal to the audience. Then again, Fred Zinnemann is an entirely different director.

Now it's a very close call I admit, but as much as I love this movie I'm inclined to choose the one before it 'For A Few Dollars More' as my favourite. Anyway, this is still a superb piece of pure entertainment, and Leone's movies had a massive impact on not just the western genre but action and adventure movies of all kinds. Clint Eastwood is super cool playing \"Blondie\" just as he was as Joe in the first movie and Monco in the second. FAFDM added a strong supporting character by Lee Van Cleef, TGTBATU continues that (though Van Cleef is playing a completely different guy) and also brings in Eli Wallach as Tuco, who adds some nice comic touches. Blondie and Tuco have lots of great scenes together, but I could have done with a lot more Angel Eyes (Van Cleef), one of the greatest screen villains of all time. Having three strong roles instead of just Eastwood is one of the great things about this movie. Another great thing is the unforgettable score by Morricone. Morricone did some of his most memorable work with Leone, and this could just be the best of the lot. Certainly the main theme (a massive hit single in the late 1960s as covered by Hugo Montenegro) is one of the most recognisable and original pieces of film music ever. Another standout is the spectacular bridge scene, surely a direct inspiration for Peckinpah's 'The Wild Bunch', a movie which owed Leone a sizable debt in my opinion. It's very difficult to pick this movie apart and single out what is so great about it as it really works as a whole. There's almost nothing wrong with it. It's one of the greatest westerns ever made and a hugely enjoyable movie that is just as compelling on your tenth viewing as your first. If you haven't seen it before I still think watching 'A Fistful Of Dollars' and 'For A Few Dollars More' first is the smartest movie, despite the three movies being a trilogy in name only, and each of the three being able to stand alone.

Clint Eastwood and director Sergio Leone had turned this Man with no Name into there creation. Giving him new characteristics and setting. After the success of that film they needed a back story to there creation. A prequel was made, possibly the first ever or the first successful prequel ever made. It is rare for a sequel to surpass the original and it is even rarer that the third one surpasses them all. This is how the notion that Leone gets better with time started. I am one who strongly disagrees. Not only is this Leone's best picture but possibly the greatest film ever made! Here the character of The Man with no Name ( or Blondie as he is nicknamed by Tuco) has an interesting origin. He is not the hero we met in the first two installments, he is conceivably a criminal. He journeys the hills as a bounty hunter, captures bandits and helps them escape so he could get more money in another town. One day he has the misfortune (or fortune) to capture the wrong bandit, Tuco.`Such ingratitude after all the times I saved your life.'\nTHE BAD'I'll ask the questions!'Lee Van Cleef made a career of playing villains. In 1965 he had the opportunity to play an hero in For a Few Dollars More, most likely his finest performance. Here he proves why he made a career of playing a villain. He is a menacing, ruthless paid assassin who always seeks his job through. He is after Bill Carson who hid $200, 000 in gold coins somewhere and Angel Eyes is determined to find it.`But you know the pity is that when I'm paid I always follow the job through.' \nTHE UGLY`I'll give you a good idea where you can put it.'The character of Tuco, played perfectly by Eli Wallach is the man who steals the show. He is a bandit with 115 counties of crimes. He like Blondie has the misfortune (or fortune) of meeting one another. His character is unique, not in a Paul Newman and Robert Redford type of unique but unique in the sense that he's a religious man. There is a fabulous scene in the film where Tuco confronts his brother, who's a priest and they have an argument on how one had the choice of a being a priest or a bandit. That is one of the best scenes in the film because Leone is showing us the portrait of life in those times. How being a poor immigrant left you with little or no opportunity.\n`If you're gonna shoot, shoot don't talk!'\nTHE BLUEThe Yankees portrayed in this film are not like any other captured on film before. They symbolize America in the `60s. They are reluctant to fight yet they have no choice but because of it they are depressed and want this whole war to end and live in peace. The drunk General is such a great character because it shows how drinking is the only thing that has kept him alive, for a while that is. \nTHE GREYSince this film takes place in the West it is obvious that the Confederates are the ones mostly depicted. They are shown as a weak and dying race. Leone actually makes you feel sorry for them. Like in the scene where Wallace is beating up Tuco and the young confederates soldiers are playing the Story of the Soldier. Beautiful scene. `More feeling!' \nTHE CIVIL WARTo understand the Civil War in this film you must understand Leone's past. He grew up during Mussolini's empire and World War II. He is familiar with the tortures of war and you can see it here. The war is brutal, sad, and chaotic, something the generation of the `60s could relate with. In addition most of the soldiers are young and perhaps poor. Another reality of war.The Questions, The Answers, and the ShowdownAs the film progress Clint Eastwood slowly acquires his trademark outfit. The irony in it is that during the whole picture Tuco is the star of the picture and then in that scene in the cemetery when Eastwood first appears in his poncho he shows who's the real star of the movie. There for the first time we see The Man with no Name we fell in love with in the first two films. But how did he turn that way? The war, the war had a lasting impression on the man. At first he didn't seem very concerned but after witnessing the event for his own two eyes it has an impact on his life and he decides to use his talent for good instead of his selfish needs.\nThe title, The Good, The Bad, and the Ugly has become a clich\u00e9 but there is meaning. The Good and the bad are simple but the Ugly has more meaning then meets the eye. We have a man who's good at heart and had the opportunity to be good in life but because of society and the way non-Anglos were treated in those days he was forced into a life of crime. That's one of the reasons why Blondie doesn't kill him at the end of the film. The partnership between Blondie and Tuco is humorous in the sense that we love there partnership and it is obvious that they enjoy one another but they still at the end screw each other up.\nFilm Critic Roger Ebert once said that a real movie lover's favorite film was a film that reflected there own life. While I myself still haven't found that film this is the closest there is. Hence why this is my favorite film of all-time and such an influential film in my life. It is a real shame that the Hollywood community have underrated this film. Just like Leone's other projects. This deserved every Oscar there is. The picture is outstanding, equally outstanding is the direction, writing, music, cinematography, costume, sound effects, editing, special effects, and above all the acting. Especially from Mr. Wallach. It is great that moviegoers have discovered this masterpiece and have given it the respect it deserves. \nRATING: 4 STARS (****) \"You stinking son of a Aaaahhhh!", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "The third motion picture of it's kind, OR the first if you think about it.

No comment is necessary here on the story of the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly--we all know it and admire it by now. Occasionally, a film comes along which makes it into the 'top ten', e.g Saving Private Ryan, Dave, Schindler's List, Life is Beautiful etc. However The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is, was and I reckon always will be my numero uno. I enjoy the film as much today as when I first saw it in 1967. In 1968 I WALKED eleven miles to a local town to see it and walked home again! Some thirty five years ago! No Videos, or DVD's in those days! I also, when I got my first car, drove to whichever local cinema the GBU was showing on the night. When I eventually got a video version I thought all my birthdays had arrived at once. What's more, I was lucky enough to get the version which I had never seen before and is seldom seen since on TV, where the captions to each character appear in English, i.e \"THE GOOD\", \"THE BAD\", and \"THE UGLY\", instead of \"IL BUONO\", \"IL BRUTTO,\" \"IL CATTIVO\", and a version which contain extra unseen (at that time)footage, eg. when Angel eyes gives Maria (Bill Carson's girl)a bigger hiding than we usually saw on the cinema version and when Wallace gives Tuco the severe beating in the POW camp, it goes on much longer than I had seen in other versions. Only recently I obtained the DVD, showing some scenes which were shot in Italian, but never in English and never incorporated in the final English spoken version. (They were in a \"Director's Cut\" version on a German channel some time back, but I suppose it was easy to incorporate them in a German version, which was dubbed anyway into German). I look forward to some method of \"digitally\" adding them to the English speaking version. These scenes were and would be still important to the continuity and understanding of the scenes. One is were Lee van Cleef, during his quest for Bill Carson, visits a military hospital. He sees the absolute horror of war and this is the only time that his character becomes almost human. He shakes his head in disbelief at the futility of the war. (Eastwood echos this belief in the futility of the war in a later scene at the bridge.) Another scene shows more of the torture that Tuco put's Eastwood's character through in the desert. A quite funny scene too! and two scenes, one before the arrival at the monastry and one after leaving, which helps the viewer to understand the whole \"Pablo Ramirez and Monastry\" scenes better. However the DVD did not show one scene which I saw on the German version. One typical Eastwood scene, where he outdraws and shoots three of van Cleef's henchmen. It is also my all time favourite soundtrack.

This film is funny, sentimental and very unique in its style and mood. Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef are the coolest antagonists ever matched in cinema however it is Eli Walach who steels the film in a very much underrated unforgettable performance. Like all of Sergio Leone films there is a very thin line that occasionally is crossed on both sides of good and evil. Tuco ` Walach ` is the center of three of the most greedy ruthless characters you will ever see yet you care about him and feel his pain when he is scorned by his brother for the path he has taken in his life. Only in the extended Italian version does Angel Eyes ` Cleef ` show any humanity as he enters a confederate hideout and displays compassion for badly wounded soldiers otherwise he is a bloodthirsty killer. If Blondie ` Eastwod ` is truly good were all going to heaven. It's not only a great western but it is my favorite Civil War film as well. Aside from the Spanish terrain the costumes, uniforms, buildings and weapons are the most historically accurate I've ever seen on film.

That being \"The Man with No Name\" trilogy.Here we have three strong characters surviving for themselves and for survival sakes. They go through a common search for confederate gold. While they are doing this, all around them the world is going insane in one of the most brutal and bloodiest wars every. We are talking about the Civil War of course. Who are the Characters. They are the characters of the title of course;The Good - Clint Eastwood. A hired mercenary, who is tired of playing by the rules, because there are none. He kills other mercenaries, for the express intent of stealing their human bounty. He, like the other two goes through the film trying to get his hands on stolen confederate gold for the express purpose of personnel wealth. Yet he is good, because, like in the previous two films of the trilogy he has a conscience, and at times cares about his victims and at times makes decisions to have mercy. To me he represents God. He is silent and gives out vengeance like god. He is also merciful.The Bad - Lee Van Cleef. In a role completely cut off from his role in #2 of the series (For a few dollars more). He has the same purpose as the Good, but he has no morals at all. He has no pity, and enjoys his acts of giving pain to others. He represents the Devil. He is even called angel eyes. Remember the Satan is a fallen angel? The ugly - Eli Wallach. In his greatest role. Also goes through the film with the same purpose as the others. He is a thief and cold blooded killer. He has little pity and even less conscience. But he does not play out his actions out of joy, but rather for plain survival. Killing and stealing is all he knows, and he is played with and used in turn by both The Good (god) and the Bad (Satan). He represents the common man. This is also the reason that he is the most compelling character in the film.It is true that what I have said up to know sounds allegoric and surreal. But the beauty and greatness of this film, is that it is all done in the telling of a wonderful adventure full of action, humor and music. The great Marcone has composed his greatest score. Leone has directed a masterpiece. There are so many great and wonderful scenes here. The arrival of the white chariot like angels from heaven in the desert, which come to save our hero. The singing of the hymn while the ugly gets tortured. (Here there is a parable to the Holocaust. The moving through the bombed out town in a gunfight duel of hidden beauty. The blowing of the bridge while the army captain dies in bliss. The giving of the Cigar (symbol of friendship and god), to the dying soldier child. The running through the cemetery in blurred frenzy that gives the feelings of the sadness of all the young deaths of war (The Vietnam war was going on at the time and greatly influenced Leone).This movie is serious art film disguised as an action adventure.It is pure delight and one of the very greatest films ever made.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 3}, "heading": "The greatest Western every made", "date": "2003-03-28T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0092769", "sentiment score": [0.0036, 0.0136, 0.0887, 0.5381, 0.356]}, {"content": "Sergio Leone's third installment in his spaghetti western \"Dollars\" trilogy is a full-blown epic about greed and the wasteful, destructive nature of warfare.In 1862 Texas, we meet Tuco (Eli Wallach), a thief with a price on his head. His friend Blondie (Clint Eastwood) runs a scam in which he turns Tuco in for bounty, and then as he about to be hanged shoots the rope and the two split the reward money. Meanwhile, Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) is hired by Baker (Enzo Petito), a bedridden Confederate soldier to find out from Stevens (Antonio Casas) what name a certain Jackson (Antonio Casale) is currently hiding under. Angel Eyes not only finds out the name, but also learns that Baker, Jackson and Stevens have stolen a case of $200,000 in gold from the Confederate Army and hidden it. Angel Eyes sets off in search of Jackson, and it's only a matter of time and coincidence until Tuco and Blondie become embroiled in this obsessive search, too.The three lead performances are the heart and soul of this film; not a scene passes in which Eastwood, Wallach or Van Cleef fail to grace the screen. Eastwood (\"The Good\") is a quiet, restrained presence who only speaks when he has to. When he does, everyone around him shuts up and listens. Wallach's Tuco (\"The Ugly\") is the exact opposite. When he should shut up, he elects to yak, shout and yell excitedly at everyone around him. And he comes up with some of the best insults, too. In one scene, Tuco and Blondie are disguised as Confederates, and Tuco calls out to fellow \"Confederate\" soldiers, only to realize that they are Union cavalrymen covered with dust. Rounding out the trio is Van Cleef's incredibly \"bad\" Angel Eyes character. Angel Eyes is the epitome of evil. Nothing motivates this man except pure, selfish greed. He's willing to kill anyone who gets in his way. His first two scenes revolve around brutal murders; he beats innocent women and, later, has Tuco beaten in one of the harshest torture sequences ever shot. Leone does give each of his leads a hint of humanity. For Blondie, it's a brief, silent encounter with a dying Confederate soldier near the film's conclusion. For Tuco, it's an encounter with his long-lost brother Pablo (Luigi Pistilli), who's become a priest; and for Angel Eyes, it's a look of disgust when he stumbles across a forgotten Confederate outpost.This film revolves around violent encounters. Leone likes to draw out his action sequences almost too far. Nobody can make this combination of long silences concluded with quick, explosive action work the way Leone does. In the first 15 minutes of the film, only one dialog exchange occurs, and six people have been murdered. The first scene consists of several mean-looking bounty hunters converging on Tuco, only to have him quickly kill all four of them and then escape through a window. The second is an exchange between Angel Eyes and Stevens. We know from the moment we're introduced to Angel Eyes how this scene will end, but it takes quite a long time to get to the expected conclusion. Scenes like these occur throughout, building up to the climactic gunfight, which consists of about five minutes of itchy eyes and twitching trigger fingers, building up to a single climactic gunshot.The theme of this movie is, undeniably, that war is a destructive waste of lives. I first saw \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" at an early age and didn't really understand Leone's theme, but subsequent viewings and a greater understanding of film as art have helped me to pick up on many of the underlying (and often blatantly stated) ideas which the central conflict revolves around. No significant military character is unaffected by the war. There's the legless soldier whom Van Cleef pays for information; Stevens has a bum leg; Baker is dying in bed; the drunken Captain (Aldo Giuffre) is addicted to alcohol, and later, is wounded; Captain Harper (Antonio Molino Rojo) has a gangrenous leg; and so on. Nobody who fights in a war is unaffected by the consequences. Even innocent people: the young blond boy from whom Eastwood received his famous poncho; Stevens' murdered son and there's Maria, the victim of rape by Confederate soldiers.Leone's directorial style comes out full-force in this film. He felt the best way to show a character's true emotion was to get in close \u0096 and he does get in very close. At least 25% of the film is composed of intense close-ups. Another 25% is shot with extreme wide angles, framing a central character against expansive backgrounds. Most of the film occurs outdoors and was shot in Almeria, Spain by brilliant cinematographer Tonino delli Colli. These exteriors are simultaneously beautiful and haunting. There's something new and out-of-the ordinary about them. Tuco and Blondie's decent into a desert hell is especially memorable, and later on, the colossal battle between Union and Confederate brigades has got to be one of the biggest battle sequences ever filmed. It's amazing to see what Leone can accomplish in one shot without any dialog. Character motivation and scene establishment is done with a facial expression or eye movement as the camera pans without cutting. Then, in the rapid action scenes, Eugenio Alabiso's masterful editing combined with Ennio Morricone's most memorable score work hand-in-hand to deliver a suspenseful encounter.\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" is an unmissable screen gem about the nature of human greed and the waste of civil war.

But most important, among the fistful of minutes more (14 exactly), you get only transitions scenes, which, at best, slows down the general pace. For example the first (and longest) patch only offers a square caveat of the gloomy war background Leone wanted to depict. So it heavily echoes the later scenes with wounded soldiers in the mission and dissolves the shock of the bridge battle scene where the horror and stupidity of war is much more striking. But the main flaw is it's only about Sentenza and Van Cleef displays the same experimented humane type he played in For a few dollars more while he is supposed to be The Bad in this movie.Shorthand: don't bother about the bloated 175min version. It's kind of a 'sneak preview' which Leone decided to trim after the initial release, so IT IS NOT a director's cut but only the last step before the final cut.

OK, I understand the deconstructionists love this movie for obvious reasons, but to call this the \"best western ever\"??? Hell, it ain't even in Clint's top three! OK we have three great characters, great cinematography, a unique, quirky, and sometimes powerful score, the first ten minutes, and the last ten minutes of the movie that are all dynamite...but then there's all that crap in between! Apparently, after 'A Few Dollars More' somebody convinced Leone he was a great maker of CINEMA(rhymes with enema) and so he set out to create this interesting but overlong sojourn to a Civil War ravaged New Mexico where bandits roamed freely between the Union and Confederate armies. Nice premise but everything drags and drags and drags-JEEZ! Each scene develops on an excruciating timeline and if you view this as a serious Western you'll be asleep 30 minutes into it...that's always the effect it had on me-even when I was 16 on it's release. But if you plant your tongue in cheek and forget about the artistic grandeur of it all then you might enjoy this thing. For example-let's dissect the famous \"bridge\" scene. (spoiler alert) So we got a drunken Union commander leading the charge (and he even looks a little like Grant but he never led any charges except to the bar at the Appomattox Holiday Inn) back and forth, to and fro...cannon fire.. boom boom...drag the dead back...yawn! Now Blondie and Tuco got to get to the other side of the river, but there's this battle raging on and on and on over this bridge so it's logical that our heroes have to blow up the bridge right? We don't know WHY but we want to see Clint blow the hell out of something don't we?? Me, I would have forded the river, which appears to be about waist deep, somewhere downstream of all the fighting but that wouldn't suit our purpose here. I fall out of my chair everytime I see our boys knock that poor wounded yankee off his stretcher so the can load it up with dynamite to haul it down to the river. So the boys wait for an intermission in the battle, wire the bridge while no one on either side is looking, blow said bridge, jump behind the sandbags for cover but one of our heroes-Tuco, has his butt stuck up in the air just waiting for one of the Rebels to shoot it off. More cannon fire..boom boom...now EVERYBODY is dead, except of course our two boys who miraculously survived. Even Tuco's ass survived all the shelling which took out everybody and everything in sight! Now with everyone dead it's safe to walk across the river to get the gold. Oh, did I forget to mention that? Yeah, they're after $200,000 in gold and there's another character in hot pursuit but I'm getting to that. First Clint/Blondie finds a cannon that hasn't been fired yet pointing in the opposite direction of the battle which suits him just fine cause it's aimed towards Tuco who is racing off to find the gold. Now Clint is so cool he never even so much as flinches when he lights the fuse with his cheroot...without a doubt the coolest scene in the film. The three finally converge at the location of the gold, there's some witty repartee' between our hero/villains, and then we all square off for a three way gunfight. Tuco, Blondie, and Angel Eyes.......eyes, guns, fingers, eyes, teeth, guns, twitching fingers, more eyes, jeez get on with it! I'm sorry people but this is not a serious western and I laugh my ass off everytime I see it. Not only is this not the \"greatest\" of all time, hell it ain't even in the top 25 IMHO. I will give the director his due for a number of innovations that have been roundly lauded here, hell I even thought the Confederate Pep Band at the prison camp was a cute idea-silly as it was. They really needed a tuba though and the woodwind section was sorely in need of beefing up, but other than that?

And when The Ugly is afraid, the movie forces you to feel the stink of his fear over his ever-present treachery!The movie has many moments that set it apart from the mundane, but, steeped in the film's extraordinary theme, the drawn-out ocular bi-play between our three protagonists near the end is surely a film masterpiece.Do not expect often to see the match of this wonderful movie, for I'm afraid the consummate skill required is not available in abundance!", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "The movie that defined the spaghetti western, well-told and full of juice.", "date": "2002-07-11T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0092738", "sentiment score": [0.0077, 0.0359, 0.1261, 0.5785, 0.2517]}, {"content": "I absolutely love a good western.

Another Leone western \"Once upon a time in the west\" is often lumped together with these making up as fine a quartet of westerns as you'll ever see. Ironically, I saw the trilogy in reverse order and, as good as they are, the first two could simply not live up to the expectations created by this sprawling, over the top masterpiece. No amount of thesaurus abuse could quite do justice to it. It's the \"Blood, sugar, sex, magik\" of film westerns, a massive work of art shattering any preconceptions you may have had of what and what does not constitute a western. It takes the genre by the scruff of the neck, shakes out all the cliches, and then adds layers and textures of pure style.The storyline is not unfamiliar; three disparate characters, Blondie (this time Eastwood does have a nickname), Tuco and Angel Eyes are all after the same prize: $200,000 in gold. Tuco, played by Eli Wallach knows the place (a cemetery) while Blondie knows the name on the grave. Their epic search takes place during the American civil war. Leone takes the this simple story and creates a visual feast. There are many unforgettable scenes; my favourite being Wallach's frantic run through the cemetery. This ranks with the mimed tennis match in \"Blow up\" as amongst the most memorable I've seen. As stunning as they are this is not merely a succession of creatively photographed scenes. Leone has given his actors room for character development. Lee van Cleef is the personification of evil, a cold bloodied killer who briefly allies himself with Eastwood as a matter of expediency. Blondie is hardly your stereotypical hero. He is a fraudster, running a scam in which he pretends to capture wanted criminals, claims the bounty and then frees them. And yet he shows compassion; blowing up a bridge in order to grant a dying commander his final wish, offering a cigar to a dying soldier. And, finally there is Tuco, the ugly. As efficient a killer as any of the other protagonists he also injects a dose of humour into the film. Already responsible for the standout scene in the film, his confrontation with his brother, a priest, is a moment of sadness and power. In a way that is not explained this unholy trio are already inextricably linked before we first meet them and, as it turns out, are bound together in death as well. Finally, as if Leone's direction is not enough there is the music of Ennio Morricone.

I saw this movie when I was only eight years old. Back then, it was purely for the cool gun battles and how funny Tuco acted at times. Now, I see it as a flawless piece of work and one of the best westerns I've ever seen.Lets' start off with Tuco, aka. The Ugly. Tuco is an outlaw. He steals, he manipulates, and he can be bloody stupid at times. Yet, he is not all bad. This character is the most interesting one in the movie, for his greed always gets the best of him instead of controlled decisions. He was my most favorite character in this movie.Angel Eyes, aka. The Bad, is one of the best villians ever in film. He rules others with an iron fist and shows no mercy to his victims. Just look at his eyes when you watch the movie. There's always this glint of evil just watching and waiting for innocent people to mess up with their lives so he can take advantage of them. I wish there was some more background on this character. I would have liked to see a movie about Angel Eyes's life.\nAnd then, The Man With No Name, aka Blondie, aka The Good. Yet he is not all good. He works with outlaws, turning them in, and then saving them so he can turn them in again for the reward money. Pure brilliance, because it shows that even heros have bad sides to them. This was his. Yet, Blondie's character also showed compassion. Watch the scene near the end of the movie with the soldier. That's an excellent example of Blondie's good side. I loved Clint Eastwood's character. He played it flawlessly.\nEach of these characters put together in a movie equal pure entertainment, and a look at the good, bad, and the ugly in everyone. Besides the characters, it gives great background into the American Civil War. This is my most favorite western in all time, and to pass it by is a serious mistake.

One indication that this is a prequel is the fact that Man with no Name begins to wear trademark outfit here. Also, story takes place right before events depicted in For a Few Dollars More(1965). Finally, film sets Blondie up as a mythical antihero in the making. Only film in Dollar trilogy where Clint Eastwood does not get beaten up. Surperbly crafted Western with hardly any flaws or boring moments.\nAmerican Civil War and its grim aspects are important to plot of The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly(1966). Portrays participates of Civil War as money hungry, glory seeking, absurdly idealized people. Examplified by a North and South army's fight for control of a bridge. The battle scene that follows shows Civil War in unromantic viewpoint. Cynical film about realities of American Civil War in same way that Giu La Testa/A Fistful of Dynamite(1972) was on Mexican Revolution. Civil War is shown in a harsh and realistic manner akin to that of an Ambrose Bierce Civil War short story.\nBlondie is an opportunistic bounty hunter with both heroic and villainous tendencies. His introduction to story is both suspenseful and tense. Clint Eastwood gives his most satisfying performance here among three films he did for Sergio Leone. Blondie is also a mythical person who has a good understanding of human nature. Although his main concern is money, Blondie still has some honorable qualities within him as expressed in his interaction with a dying soldier. A cool character who in story turns disadvantage into advantage.\nAngel Eyes as played by Lee Van Cleef is a purely evil and vicious gunslinger. Angel Eyes introduction is memorable as he takes out rivals who hired him to kill the other. Lee Van Cleef as Angel Eyes is second to Henry Fonda's performance in Once Upon a Time in the West(1968) as Leone's best villain. A pinnicle role in the career of Lee Van Cleef. Angel Eyes is the mirror image of Blondie with his skills with the gun and hunger for money. Makes Villains in contemporary Hollywood films look like wimps.\nTuco is the most complex and sympathetic of the trio. Has an outlaw persona with traits of humanity that does not make him an entirely bad person. The Good The Bad & The Ugly(1966) is Eli Wallach's film in same way For a Few Dollars More(1965) was Lee Van Cleef's film. Eli Wallach turns Tuco into a comical and daring character who is always trying to better himself. In a sense, Tuco is alike to Vasco of Sergio Corbucci's Companeros(1970). A well written and three dimensional character due to fine work by Eli Wallach and Sergio Leone.\nSergio Leone shows Wild West life and scenery in stylistic realism. Sergio Leone by the time, The Good The Bad & The Ugly(1966) came out had mastered his skills as a filmmaker which shows in direction and screenplay. Sergio Corbucci did his own take on this film a couple of years later with !Vamos a Matar, Companeros!(1970). In Companeros(1970) there is also an uneasy partnership as well as a good(Franco Nero), a bad(Jack Palance), and an ugly(Tomas Milian). Plot of The Good, the Bad, and the ugly is characterized by switching partnerships and double crosses. Each person teams up with one or the other to make it easiler to get the hidden treasure.\nIl Buono Il Brutto Il Cattivo is explicitly known for its flamboyant Ennio Morricone score. Its title song became a part of American popular culture. One of the ten best film scores by Ennio Morricone. What makes Morricone my favorite film composer is his ability to create music that is eccentric and grandeur. This film definitely has a big love for music which shows in the partnership of Ennio Morricone and Sergio Leone. Like in other Italian Westerns, each main person has his own theme song.\nViolent nature and sadistic behaviors contrasts it with romantic portrayal of American Frontier in Classic American Westerns. I think of it as a Western Noir because of the involvement of greed. Also, main characters are not clear cut good or bad guys but people with both characterizations. Humor is around the viciousness of story especially in the hanging sequences. The moment when Blondie shoots Tuco off the rope and hats off everyone else's head is the funniest sequence. Mario Brega is imposingly memorable as the sadistic henceman of Angel Eyes, Corporal Wallace.\nA dangerous moment was the blowing up of the bridge which is brilliantly set up with some excellent editing moments. Trip around the cemetery in search of hidden treasure contains fast paced editing, relentless cinematography, and tight framing. Sam Peckinpah was inspired by bridge explosion moment for his own bridge explosion scene in The Wild Bunch(1969). Cinemtography is flawless especially in composition, movement, and scenery. My favorite line is from Tuco who tells a bounty hunter he kills from a tub, \"When you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk.\" Both Mario Bava and Sergio Leone had a love for the European arts, music, and painting.\nHighlight is three way duel between Blondie, Angel Eyes, and Tuco. Morricone composed a fabulous score which builds and builds until tension is big enough to explode. Excellent set up, crisp editing, and beautiful camera work makes scene an instant classic. Never lets down in sustaining a suspenseful mood. Coolest and most imaginative duel in a Sergio Leone western.

All three actors are great. Clint Eastwood is icy, cool, quietly efficient. He turns in accused criminals for bounties and frees them before they are hung. Lee Van Cleef is also cool like Eastwood, but he is actually more slick and smooth, and dressed in black, is decidedly evil, and more dynamic than Eastwood in execution, if not better. But Eli Wallach, as Tuco, actually comes out best, in my book, perhaps because of the nature of his character. In Leone's Spaghetti Westerns, the idea is not John Wayne white hats versus the bad guys with black hats. Instead, our desire for entertainment is catered to through exposes of visuals and base instincts. Tuco embodies those base instincts. However, altho he is my favorite (including most humorous) character of the three, like I believe he is for many, he is certainly not one for my self-image. I hope not for yours, either. Anyway, at least Blondie has somewhat of a conscience. Angel Eyes and Tuco do not.Tuco personifies raw greed, and he will do anything to get the treasure and keep it all for himself. He is an archtypical Mexican bandit, who displays sincerity like a con man and proceeds to stab you in the back. He draws out the emotions, the tensions. His greed has great promise, but then his frustrations are greater, and his displays of both are sort of the life of the film. And he is funny. Well, actually, lots of the humor is because he is such a loser, so often outdone by the two other principals. Even tho they are not wonderful people either, we laugh at Tuco. That's part of the entertainment: Our emotions are not worked up to see the bad people beat the good people, since this distinction is not defined or even conceded to exist. Tuco is a greedy fat buffoon, Blondie and Angel Eyes are slick. Who do you want to see get it?This movie has lots of action, lots of violence. It might not be called outright graphic violence (in the strict sense of some Italian films), but it is certainly partially there, and it is well shot. The cinematography is superb, as the Italian Leone presents visual images that portray the American West very believably. The shots of the vast barren (some mostly, some all) landscape are excellent, with good colors and the camera bringing you around, in and out. Arouse us with all this, and the search for treasure, of course being stolen gold, keep arousing us. Then there is the score. It is western majestic, concise, catchy. The score's visual images are perfect for this film, which ventures into the wide open spaces.\nA great movie is not complete without a good ending. And it is great, beyond great, climaxing the themes of the film. As entertainment, \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" blows away traditional westerns by far.

I thought it was like an action movie but without the comforting elements usually associated with action movies like moral clarity and extremely spectacular fight scenes. However, recently, I saw it again on video and liked it for this exact same reason and more. The movie begins with a credit sequence of gun shots, grainy photos from the movie, and great music by Ennio Morricone that already tells you to expect a trip that\u00b4s exciting and fun. Then it rushes straight into a set of fight scenes which introduce the three main characters very dramatically (complete with titles to let you know which adjective in the title each character represents). Each of these characters is a morally flawed person who makes a living off of death. The \"Bad\" Angel Eyes makes his living as a soldier and a mercenary. The \"Good\" Blondie makes his living by making a travesty of hangings by always freeing the convicted men he turns in for reward money just before the rope should kill them. His \"goodness\" is only relative. The \"Ugly\" Tuco basically makes his living any way he can and his list of crimes is absurdly varied (ranging from all kinds of violence to statutory rape). He is a true opportunist without overriding morals but not entirely without a conscience. Played by Eli Wallach, Tuco actually steals the show from his 2 more famous costars because while they are almost superhuman in their skills, he is strikingly human in all his flaws. All three of these men, on individual terms, eventually come to know of a fortune buried in a graveyard and constantly keep fighting each other for knowledge of its exact location since each man only knows a different hint of where it is hidden and not the whole story. While such a plot does not seem too great, Sergio Leone choreographs every scene (violent or otherwise)to make it as suspenseful and expertly made as possible. The film also gets a lot of its entertainment value from Tarantinoishly holding nothing sacred. The three heroes scheme against other characters with a joyfully effortless malevolence, and not even the American Civil War is held sacred as the men try to manipulate the \"senseless\" conflict full of hopelessly drunken soldiers to make their quest for the treasure easier. The result of all this is that although \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" is more than 3 hours long, there is never a dull moment, making it seem about an hour or so shorter than it actually is. What\u00b4s most important, though, is that it is a thinking person\u00b4s action movie which unpretentiously demonstrates the absurdity of real life and helps us to laugh at it.

This is the western that broke the mold. Clint Eastwood IS The Good, Lee Van Cleef IS the bad, and Eli Wallach IS the Ugly. Good guys and bad guys were no longer separated by wearing white hats and black hats. One can certainly question just how \"Good\" Eastwood's character is. Set during the civil war, it follows the title trio (comprised of Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Wallach) on their quest for 200 thousand dollars in gold. The question is, who will get it first?As \"The Good\" Clint Eastwood leaves nothing to be desired, giving the role just enough of the quiet cockiness that it needs. Eastwood had the two previous films to build the character on, and it shows.\n\"The Bad\" Is definitely my favorite role in the film. I do some community theater acting and if there's a bad guy in the play I usually play it! That's why I like the role. The bad guys have all the fun! Lee Van Cleef is exceptional. no one else could have given the role what he did. This is the first movie I saw Lee Van Cleef in, and it put him at the top of my list of favorite actors. What really is amazing is that he plays the exact opposite of this role in the previous film, \"For a Few Dollars More.\" Since I saw the films out of order(I still haven't had a chance to see the first) When I saw Van Cleef in \"For a Few Dollars More, I kept expecting the other shoe to fall with his Colonel Douglas Mortimer character. To my Delight, it never did. If you are going to watch \"The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, You have to get \"For a Few Dollars More and watch them both. Van Cleef Really is amazing to watch. And I Think he was a hell of an actor! And as \"The Ugly\" Eli Wallach Physically embodies greed. That is the only way to describe it. Wallach definitely has the most developed character. One minute, he's the best friend you've ever had, and the next minute he's stabbing you in the back for your money. When he and Eastwood find The man who knows where the money is, Tuco tells the dying man not to die until after he's told Tuco where the money is! He also has a great line in a scene towards the end involving him and a gunslinger that lost his arm because of him. I would describe it, but I don't want to give it away. Wallach gives on hell of a performance. I actually thought he was Spanish, until someone told me that he was Jewish! \nSergio Leone certainly Gives us one hell of a movie. There is not a second of film wasted. While the whole movie is great, there are two scenes that really stand out in my mind. The first is the scene where Tuco(\"The Ugly\") runs through a graveyard searching for one name on the hundreds of grave markers. The total scene is about three and a half minutes of him searching, and blended with a superior song from Ennio Morricone, and it is part of film history. No one will ever be able to duplicate what Leone, Wallach and Morricone did with it. That's another thing I have to mention. While all the soundtrack music Morricone composed is terrific, He outdid himself with this Soundtrack. Every song fits every scene perfectly. The only soundtrack I can compare it to is the shark theme from \"Jaws\".The second scene is the final showdown between the Three main characters. Leone took his time with this one. It has dozens of different camera shots, and terrific song to underscore it. Leone builds up the suspense until it's almost unbearable, and trust me, the climax is worth the wait. To give any of it away would be criminal.\nIf you want to see the perfect western, you have to see this movie.

The grouping of three that is of interest to me are the cinematic influences behind this film: Hollywood westerns, Italian iconic painting, Japanese starkness in representation. These Italian westerns are important. Most movies are about other movies, but this one affected much of what followed. The western vocabulary was mature and popular well before movies, and with the detective story drove the first revolution in modern mass publishing. Its simple abstractions were converted to film (then radio and TeeVee) without change: the boy scout cowboy in the usually white hat, often singing. (In fact the modern pop country music borrows from this simple vocabulary and reference to the `genuine.') But all that, including the country music bit is pretty flat, stupid and dull.Italian cinema is based on a similar set of national icons, specifically religious icons. It is a more visual, visceral painterly vocabulary. Equally simple in stereotypes, but instead there are religiously based connections that give the impression of depth. Symbology is expected, even demanded. To this add postwar notions of irony which permeated European popular art. So the good guy was still good, but in a twisted way -- the twists shifting according to the chaos he encountered.In the US, John Ford was creating soft lush panoramas that would subliminally inspire a generation of environmentally aware viewers, but something more important came rushing in from Japan: Kurosawa. His films are abstract, directly evolved from Japanese watercolor narratives. These are also lush and beautiful, but not soft -- instead dusty, gritty, sometimes cruel. This world is not placid, merely a machine to test color and honor.In the Eastwood/Leone films, these three influences were deliberately enfolded. And a whole world's visual vocabulary shifted.

In a way, it's a morality play, weighing the consequences of good and evil, but it does so in a realistic manner. Sometimes, crime does pay, at least in the short term, and sometimes good does go unrewarded. This film probably signaled the death knell of the traditional John Wayne `White Hat/Black Hat' Western.The three main characters make the film. Lee Van Cleef (`The Bad') is evil personified. Totally ruthless, he'll do whatever it takes to get what he wants. Clint Eastwood (`The Good') is the Man With No Name, not really `good' in a traditional sense . . . but he has a certain sense of honor and tries to do the right thing. (Watch the scene when he gives a dying Confederate soldier a puff of his cigar - powerful, and it sums up everything that the Man With No Name is all about, without saying a single word.) Eli Wallach (`The Ugly') is Tuco, and he's easily the most complex - if not the best - character in the film. All impulse and rage, Tuco spins wildly throughout the movie, stealing, lying, pretending to be Clint Eastwood's best friend in one scene, trying to kill him in another - Tuco truly represents `the ugly' side of people.The movie is long, but there's not a wasted scene in the film. Each one slowly lets the film unfold with a certain style and grace, revealing more about each character and what's going on. The pacing is incredible, as is the direction - Sergio Leone manages to build a lot of uncomfortable tension in the film, keeping the film from ever getting predictable. Any typical Western clich\u00e9 that you can possibly think of is either given a unique twist or utterly destroyed by Leone's masterful storytelling. Of special mention is Ennio Morricone's score, which is absolutely perfect. Two scenes - one in a Union prison camp, one in the climatic gunfight in the cemetery at the end of the film - are amazing on their own, but they become absolutely astonishing with combined with Morricone's powerful score. This movie is absolutely brilliant. If you haven't seen it yet, I strongly urge to do so. Immediately. (And then, go watch `Unforgiven' . . . in a way, I think that `Unforgiven' is the sequel to `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly - it's the story of what eventually happened to the Man With No Name.) `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' is easily one of the best Westerns ever made.

Blondie is the benevolent free spirit, Western Man in his perfect incarnation. His partner and nemesis is Tuco, the irresistible rogue who combines charm, courage and total amorality in equal measure. Only Tuco knows where the graveyard is, but only Blondie knows where to dig, so each must keep the other alive if they are to collect the money.\"The Good, The Bad And The Ugly\" is the keystone of the 'Dollars' trilogy, and the pinnacle of the Spaghetti Western genre. Neither before nor after did the format achieve this sweeping majesty, this clarity of characterisation or this narrative power. Leone's curious hybrid of American art-form, Japanese look and European sensibility worked beautifully - and hit its zenith in this picture.Ennio Morricone's revolutionary musical score is universally acclaimed. The conservatoire-educated composer came up with material for this film which is more than merely innovative and arresting - it sets a new benchmark by which to measure cinematic composition. The central motif was an instant worldwide hit and has never lost popularity, but the score has much more to offer than one engaging melody. Insistently-picked guitar enhances moments of tension, and the lasciviously latin trumpet passage at the film's climax expands the meaning of the photographic images. Music melds with visuals like paint bonding with plaster to form fresco. Without that music, this film is almost unimaginable.A picaresque story in the great European tradition, the film recalls (and extends) the line of inheritance which runs from \"Lazarillo de Tormes\" through Voltaire and Dickens. Misery acquaints a man with strange bedfellows, and Blondie and Tuco find themselves meandering in tandem through an evilly-disposed universe, lurching from one scrape to another (the desert episode, the prisoners-of-war episode, etc.) This western Quixote and Sancho double act draws on the selfsame comic proposition, that two very different men, yoked together by fate's whimsy, can forge an understanding that comes close to love.Though Blondie is the 'doer' and the presiding intelligence, the heart of the film is occupied by the unforgettable Tuco. What a character! Comical charlatan, savvy killer, conscienceless swindler and lovable monster, Tuco remains fascinating for every second that he is on the screen. Fine writing delineated the character but it took Eli Wallach's inspirational performance to breathe life into one of cinema's immortal rogues. With the natural courage of a wild animal and the vulnerability of a born loser, Tuco is suffused with a vital humanity which leaps off the screen. His introductory vignette is a masterpiece of exposition, told entirely in images. Our anti-hero escapes a gunning-down (not for the last time!) and makes off gnawing a chicken leg, wiliness, vigour and sensuality mingling in one great affirmation of life itself. Tuco is the other, the dispossessed, the one who must rely on his wits to survive. He is the most frenetic character in the film, and the one who constantly wears a noose around his neck. He has developed his 'otherness' and transmuted it into a life force. Tuco is, par excellence, one of \"those that come in by the window\".If you think of the world's great novels, it is surprising how many of them are comic - \"Ulysses\", \"A La Recherche\", \"Oliver Twist\", etc. And so it is with this cinematic novel. Virtually every scene is casseroled in a piquant comic sauce. The lists of Tuco's outrageous crimes, read aloud at his various hangings, the wild fluctuations in the relative fortunes of Blondie and Tuco, the transparent attempts of Tuco to save his own skin in every tight corner - all combine to make this a richly comic work, though the humour is usually dry and always understated.This is a film of immense visual power. Each of the three protagonists is given an opening vignette: extreme close-up forces the viewer to take note of the vulpine quality of Lee Van Cleef's extraordinary eyes, fixing him in the mind as a merciless predator. Blondie is seen, not as a man whole and complete, but fragmented by his defining symbols - hat, cigar and gun-holster. The desert sequence contains an image of Blondie staggering on foot, with Tuco's mounted shadow pursuing him over the sand, an object lesson in conveying mood and information without words. Tuco sets an empty bottle rolling down a dune, and in the next shot it hits Blondie in the face. Tuco's ascendancy and Blondie's fading hope are communicated in a single gesture. Blondie's compassion for the whipped mongrel Tuco is enshrined in the little act of sharing a cigar. In the gunshop scene, Tuco hardly utters a word, but his purpose, his knowledge of guns (and the lethal beauty of the weapons themselves) is conveyed powerfully. Tabernas, the Spanish location, is a place of parched hills and scrubby desert, and the film makes superb use of wide panoramas to capture the quality of the terrain. The American Civil War happened on the green pastures of Virginia, not in this barbaric Nowhere, but it doesn't matter. Rock and sand provide a mythical context for these exotic characters who never existed, and never could exist.The finale, with its three-way draw, is epic in scale. Tuco's crazed run through the tombstones is brilliantly shot, with the short field of focus rendering the graves a single unbroken blur as Tuco's greed blinds him to reality. Rapid cuts between the eyes of the participants in the draw heighten the tension dramatically, and then after the explosive release, the closing conceit is a comic gem worthy of a Moliere or a Goldoni.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 3}, "heading": "\"People With Ropes Round Their Necks Don't Always Hang\"", "date": "2001-02-26T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0092711", "sentiment score": [0.0185, 0.0777, 0.1698, 0.5244, 0.2095]}, {"content": "This is a very entertaining movie.

Having seen this film very briefly on an old VHS tape, and then experiencing it on 16x9 Enhanced DVD, there is just no comparison. It's like looking at the interior of a mansion through a keyhole, then looking through the wide-open door. The scene in which Tuco discovers the graveyard where the pot of gold is buried is a classic example of a scene that loses all of its drama when chopped down just to fit some tiny little narrow screen.Of course, it's not just the cinematography that earns this film a place in the top 250 of all time. Clint Eastwood's non-existent acting style actually benefits the film, as the less his character says to anyone, the more enigmatic he becomes. Eli Wallach is annoying, but that was the whole idea all along as far as I can tell, and he does this job well. Lee Van Cleef is suitably devilish as \"Angel Eyes\" Setenza, the ultimate expression of the mercenary sensibility concept. They're the only three actors whose roles have any semblance of development, but the style they bring to each role is more than enough to carry the film by itself.It's also no accident that the main theme of this film, as well as \"The Ecstasy Of Gold\", the theme we hear during Tuco's hunt for Arch Stanton's grave, are among the most frequently replayed or outright ripped off pieces of film scoring in the history of cinema. The latter is especially powerful, as it takes what would otherwise be a meaningless sequence of a man dashing through a makeshift cemetary into one of the most powerful moments of the film. There's only one other composer I've heard who has performed an equally amazing feat through the use of music - John Williams.Of course, the best element of this film is that it shows the American Civil War the way it really happened. Slavery was just one element of the war, and a relatively minor one at that. Other elements such as British Loyalism, economic problems, taxation without representation, and general discrimination were the causes of the war. To the everyday man, represented in three different ways by the film's principal characters, the causes of the war were secondary to the opportunities for exploiting either side in order to make a fortune. It has been that way well before the Civil War, and it will always be that way long after the Civil War is long-forgotten. In that sense, this film is less a Western than it is a drama about three greedy men after a pot of gold.And if you want to see the reason why television screens are *finally* being made wider, get the 16x9 Enhanced DVD version of this film that is available in America (NTSC) or Europe/Australia (PAL).

They were briefly interned in a Civil War prison camp for Confederate sympathizers and after being released, began making robberies that, according to Jim Reynolds, were to help out Jefferson Davis and the Confederacy. The loot was buried somewhere in the area of Handcart Gulch and Spanish Peaks in Colarado Territory and later, after Jim Reynolds and four members of his gang had been executed by Colonel John M. Chivington of the Union Army, John Reynolds, dying from a fatal wound during a holdup, supposedly whispered out the location of his old gang's ill gotten loot. Unlike the movie version, it was never found.Regardless of whether or not this was the actual basis for TGTBATU, it is nevertheless a film more grounded in history than a lot of it's comtemparies and, indeed, more than a few of it's successors. The Civil War is part of the backdrop, but it does so on a forgotten front of that war, the Western theater. Most high-school history classes would have us believe that nothing happened out West, but plenty did. In fact, the last skirmish of the war, if I'm not mistaken, was in New Mexico and, ironically enough, a Confederate victory.The central of this film is greed. You don't just see it in the quest for the Confederate gold by Blondie, Angel Eyes, and Tuco. There are signs of it everywhere; in the hotel manager talking about how he'll be glad to get the Northerners in town for the money they'll bring in, Bill Carson appealing to Tuco's greed for a single sip of water, the gang of cutthroats who are systematically robbing the Confederate prisoners of their goods. Set up against the harsh desert backdrop, it exposes the ultimate folly of that greed (the best symbol of it perhaps being the cemetary where the gold is buried). A little over a decade before the Reagan era of \"Greed is healthy, greed is good\", this film provides the ultimate rebuttal to that argument. Greed has gotten just as many men killed, if not more, than patriotism ever did. Such a subtext makes \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\" the cinematic child of John Huston's \"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\" and the precursor to Oliver Stone's \"Wall Street\".As great as Leone, Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Wallach are, there is one member of this team that pushs this film into the status of greatness: score writer Ennio Morricone. Not only does he manage to write one of the most recognized theme tunes on the planet, he also adds the extra tension needed to convey the drama with the necessary oomph, the best examples being in Blondie's torturous walk across the desert, Tuco's frantic search through the cemetary (my personal favorite and so good that Lucasarts did a slowed-down version of it for their western shooter, \"Outlaws\"), and, of course, the final three way shoot-out. He still composes scores for many other films to this day, I've been told. A good example of his most recent work would be the 1990 version of \"Hamlet\" starring Mel Gibson and directed by Franco Zefferelli. But I truly doubt that he'll ever be able to top the legendary work he did here.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 43, "votes": 54}, "heading": "The best cinematic meditation on greed since \"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\"...", "date": "2000-08-26T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0092695", "sentiment score": [0.0246, 0.1803, 0.4493, 0.3071, 0.0387]}, {"content": "This is probably one the finest westerns ever made.

Robbed of context, war is seen for what it is, a mass slaughter, a gigantic mirror firing squad searing the land, the logical outcome of progress.The Civil War is often seen as the defining moment of the American 'idea', the victory of certain ideals about liberty and fraternity. Here prized Amercian liberty is a sprawl of corpses and limbs. The 'good' Yankees, the ones who might be seen as carriers of the official myth, are lame, dying, ineffectual, drunk, neurotic, in both cases prone, helpless to stop the victory of evil. The truth about America, embodied in Angel Eyes, the one effective, powerful Union leader we see, is one of torture, robbery and murder. Many have compared the prisoner-of-war camp sequences to World War II - Angel Eyes' Gestapo-like interrogations; the prisoners' orchestra like those in many concentration camps; the equation of the compound with these camps; the wholesale fleecing of prisoners; the trains jammed with prisoners going to their deaths. What is shocking is that the men equated with Nazis are the bringers of liberty to slaves, and the creators of a space for the American dream, free from European abuses and corruption. Leone shows that American history - the genocide of natives; the history of slavery (and Civil Rights was a traumatic issue is the US at the time); the obscene culturalisation of capitalism and its concomitant military Imperialism are not all that different from the Nazi project (never mind that it was the spillover of the Civil War that offset the Wild West).What is most bitter of all is that in the midst of this holocaust, the mythic machinations of capitalism, as adumbrated in the opening DOLLARS films, continues unabated. Indeed, so powerful is the drive of Blondie, Tuco and Angel Eyes, that is can actually remove the obstacle of a full-blown war, clear history and human idiocy out of their ritualistic games (the bridge sequence). History tries to catch them; they are swept up by it on occasion, but constantly elude it, looking on at the spectacle just as we do, hitting the remote control when they're sated. It could be said that they are finally marginalised by the reality of America and history, that the grotesque, extreme close-ups are replaced by sweeping long shots full of anonymous distracted mass, but it's really the other way around, America and history have no way of stopping the mythic drive, indeed it depends on it. GOOD makes all 'traditional' Westerns look thin. Like 'Ulysses', every scene is a classic in itself, rich in detail, character, incident, critique, meaning and form. Who'd have thought in the 1960s that the greatest, most celebrated and influential Italian director would not be Antonioni, Fellini or Visconti, but a hack of sensationalist oaters. But Leone's overwhelming mastery of form is near its peak here, as he brings together all the thematic concerns of the first two films. The opening vignettes adumbrate the terms of reference - ugly is defined by gluttony and constant quick-witted flight; bad is a frightening display of murderous, yet humorous efficiency, pinned down by a curious code of conduct; good embodies a systematic defiance and humiliation of the law, inhuman greed, betrayal and attempted sadistic murder. The geometry of circle and triangle are repeatedly invoked to underpin the fabled linearity of the west, endless combinations from the boy at the well and the climactic shootout, to the opening triangle of Angel Eyes and Tuco linked to food, Blondie not. The themes of the family (Angel Eyes' opening slaughter; Tuco and his brother), religion (the monastary hospital; Blondie as Tuco's guardian angel, with the power to give and take life; his Jesus-like ordeal in the desert, taunted by the devil), the place of the body in a mythical landscape (and Blondie suffers a horrible lashing in the desert), and the contrasting of these mythic archetypes with gross, concupicent humanity, a humanity that opens and closes the film, because this is Wallach's film, a man whose crimes have understandable motivation (women, food, money for comfort etc.), who must live in while the abstractions haunt the Western landscape. The score, though frequently parodic and comic as ever, is one of Morricone's most beautiful, though always ironic; its elegiac, ethereal adagios scoring scenes of intolerable barbarity. In a film bursting with comedy and action, with scenes of great formal beauty (watch Angel Eyes' exit after his first slaughter), of unforgettable set-pieces, the hallucinatory finale in the field of death, where the quest of the movie (and all American quests?) is equated with the grave, where the hilariously sexualised rite is rudely interrupted, has got top them all.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 6}, "heading": "The third greatest Western ever made.", "date": "2000-07-10T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0092690", "sentiment score": [0.0503, 0.0977, 0.1391, 0.4309, 0.2821]}, {"content": "Any truly successful film should convincingly create it's own world, and, from the very beginning, draw the viewer into that world.

After developing the characters played by Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, and Eli Wallach, the film brings them together into a series of adventures (mostly misadventures) that tie together into a larger quest. The result makes the viewer feel that the he has been pulled into a larger-than-life tale of epic proportions, and yet the less glorified reality of GB&U is that of three men of varying levels of disreputability vying against one another for a fortune in gold coins.Although I'm sure that GB&U didn't introduce moral ambiguity into the western, it does so both successfully and memorably. The central characters are all anti-heroes, the plot revolves around a fairly base motivation (i.e., greed), and the backdrop of the Civil War provides director Sergio Leone with an opportunity to expose the inhumanity and hypocrisy of war. Truth, justice, and glory are not held up as eternal values in this film, yet GB&U nevertheless shows how even morally ambiguous characters set within an amoral environment can still carve out an occasional bit of humanity or simple decency in spite of themselves.I've seen GB&U probably at least a dozen times, and each time I'm pulled in as completely as I was the last.

Remarkably, eight rate a 7.0 or better among IMDB members, and five are the on the IMDB Top 250 film all time best list! GB&U is the highest rated of Leone films by IMDB subscribers. GB&U is also the final segment of the most successful western trilogy ever made, the \"man with no name\" series; though GB&U is a prequel to the first film, A FISTFULL OF DOLLARS. Narratively, I've always felt GB&U is the weakest of the series. However, now that I have seen the DVD version with the excised scenes, I believe it is the strongest. Two scenes in particular tie the film together. The first, and most crucial, is a scene where Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef) visits a battle-damaged Confederate fort and is told the best place to find \"Bill Carson\" (if he is alive) is in the Union P.O.W. camp. So Angel Eyes appearance later in the film at the camp as the chief jailer makes sense. The second excised scene shows Tuco (Eli Wallach) taking the horribly dehydrated Blondie (Clint Eastwood) to the nearest confederate camp, and finding out the mission where his brother lives is nearby. Now, Tuco's assuming the identity of \"Bill Carson\" makes much more sense.I can still quibble with some other shortcomings of the film. Lee Van Cleef did such a terrific job as a the heroic Colonel Mortimer in the previous film in the trilogy, FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE, it is almost impossible to accept him here as the cold- blooded killer Angel Eyes (Could the name be referring to the \"Angel of Death?\" The narrative never explains.) Second, though Eastwood's hair is blonde in highlights, the name \"Blondie\" seems rather arbitrary and, again, jarring. Still, these are minor quibbles about a film and a series that transformed westerns completely. The influence of the \"Man With No Name\" series can be found in virtually every great western made since.Though the narrative is, on the surface, about three incredibly ruthless men pursuing $200,000 across a landscape of the Civil War, GB&U's underlying agenda is \"anti-war\", particularly the Vietnam War. The film makes these points effectively without being offensively preachy.Critics of the time criticized the film for \"putting a desert in the middle of the South.\" What a crock! Although not in thecenter of the War Between the States, quite a bit of action took place in New Mexico and Texas, and the film's writers even got the generals' names right!This is the handsomest of all of Leone's films, and that's saying a lot. The art direction and set decoration are particularly impressive, down to the mortars, gatling guns and naval-style artillary of the time. Amazingly, CLEOPATRA, made four years before, cost almost 30 times as much! Never before or since have I seen so much of the budget up there on the screen.If you plan to see this film, make sure you watch it on a DVD with additional scenes. You will need to turn on the English subtitles, since the cheap distributors didn't bother to hire \"sound-alikes\" to dub these \"fill-in\" scenes. Hopefully, CRITERION will one day release a restored version of this films with the additional scenes inserted in the film where they belong.
