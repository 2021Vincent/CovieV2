With every bump and turn, the threat of explosion looms over them, and the tension is almost unbearable. The characters are brilliantly developed, and the performances are outstanding, with Yves Montand leading the way.Clouzot's direction is superb, and the cinematography is simply breathtaking.

The acting is great, the music is great, the cinematography is pretty dated/low budget, but it can be looked past. The real strength of the movie is the plot; not only is the concept brilliant for a thriller (having the characters vulnerable to dying at literally every second is a fantastic way to add tension), but the pacing is brilliant. Just when there's a quiet moment, and the volunteers seem to be getting the hang of the trucks, some new problem or dilemma presents itself. The movie almost lost me at the end; it faked me out by pretending to move towards an undeserved happy ending.

Phrases like \"explosive drama\" or \"high-stakes adventure\"and sometimes even the strange term \"existential noir.\" I guess the last one is favored by critics who delight in nihilistic undertones.Personally I find it all a bit much. It's not that it isn't a skillfully made picture and throughly engrossing- it most certainly is. But I think Clouzot tries too hard with so many contrivances to pit the four men, especially Montand's character, against every conceivable obstacle on the road to hell.In this regard it seems like a precursor to the Bond pictures. You know, where the makers storyboard endless stunts, some of them rather gimmicky, to stretch out an otherwise paper thin plot. Along the way, the audience experiences a series of predetermined jolts designed to make them think this is exciting cinema and that they have been sufficiently entertained.At least THE WAGES OF FEAR isn't that formulaic. But it is still predictable in spots, in how it strives to set up its male archetypes then hurls them towards their inevitable doom. As if such destruction will make them significantly heroic and somehow important if not altogether great men.My biggest gripe is that I don't feel as they all should die. Couldn't one of the drivers, maybe not even Montand, have had a more hopeful ending? Why not let one of them survive the horrors and learn something from it. We might have had a more thoughtful film. It's too easy for all these guys to just get killed off.Clouzot added in a female character that was not in the original story. In her final moment on screen, she collapses. This role was created for the director's wife Vera, with whom he would make four films (three as an actress and one as a screenwriter). All of the Clouzots' collaborations are highly lauded.One thing that cannot be overlooked when discussing THE WAGES OF FEAR is some of the anti-U. S. sentiment contained in various scenes. Interestingly, the film was embraced by American critics as well as Hollywood filmmakers who often emulated aspects of the nitroglycerin plot in their own productions.In the late 1950s Warner Brothers produced a pseudo retelling with VIOLENT ROAD. However, in that version, the main driver (Brian Keith) does not get blown to smithereens, and a more standard happy ending is applied. He just keeps on trucking.

You wouldn't suspect that from the lackluster opening 30 minutes of the exposition. It's the next 2 hours that is some of the most suspenseful and emotional cinema you will ever watch.The plot follows a poor man named Mario who eventually joins four others on an extremely dangerous mission of transporting nitroglycerin across a hostile landscape for a number of miles. In return, the quartet is paid $2000, enough to afford a flight to escape their lives of near squalor. The whole risking our lives for money concept reminded me of Squid Game. It does have the suspense of that show since the slightest wrong move could spell doom for the drivers. In the beginning, it starts as an elaborate obstacle course with potholes, roads as bumpy as corrugated iron, narrow bridges, rocks obstructing the road, and a pool of oil. The blowing up of the rock and the oil spill scenes were enough to completely glue my eyes to the screen. The suspense doesn't come from a scary monster or even time, but simply the deadly nature of chemicals beyond human control. Add on the abrupt death of Bimba and Luigi and the stakes become high.It starts as a commentary on class struggle and the unknown risks of hard labor. The main message is about how morals are eroded when we are enticed with money. This is most apparent when Mario deliberately runs over Jo's leg in the oil scene, betraying their friendship. Yet, the film makes one ponder: To what extent is the prospect of a better life worth dying for?

He also took the opportunity to marry the exceedingly beautiful Vera Clouzot, who would appear in LE SALAIRE DE LA PEUR and, more famously, in LES DIABOLIQUES.Clouzot experienced life in South America in loco. He learned of the difficulties of survival in that environment, the decimation of nature and exploitation of human beings by rampant and merciless capitalism. All those aspects bob up in LE SALAIRE DE LA PEUR, but human nature provides the central propeller. We see human nature battling for money, killing and putting one's life at risk for what amounts to a pittance. Envy, greed emerge as the main motivators as Mario (Montand), M Jo (Vanel), Folco Lulli (Luigi) and Bimba (Van Eyck) battle inch by inch the vagaries of potholed roads that can instantly set off the nitro, atmospheric conditions, rotting wooden bridges, and all manner of natural obstacles as the shipment of nitroglycerin nerve-rackingly slowly moves across the 300 miles to an oil fire.Plus, of course, the deceit immanent in the human soul, which constantly seeks an opportunity to spring a trap on a fellow traveler, not to mention that if only one survives, he gets the whole $2,000 booty. In a Venezuela - a minicosmos for South America - brimming with atrocious poverty and backwardness, that amount seems a fortune to those men, and to any of the other jilted competitors, who would sell their souls to be able to go on that almost suicidal drive.Yet, ironically, some kind of personal interest-driven loyalty also develops and connects these individuals, pushing them deeper and deeper into God-forsaken territory. I do not recall a single mention of religion. Yet the cocktail of French, English, Castillian and Italian languages offers a veritable Tower of Babel in a largely uncivilized, uncultured, and even illiterate setting. There is no spiritual authority, higher moral value here. The love that Linda (Vera Clouzot) feels for Mario, an almost telepathic connection, as the ending will show, is probably the closest connection between two persons in the film.All told, excellent nitty gritty, taut script, tapping the complexity of human emotions and states of mind under such trying conditions.

There's a surprising amount of solid character work, especially when it comes to one particular character who ends up revealing himself to be the total opposite of what he is initially set up to be. It's a remarkable transition and it showcases some really solid acting skills (you've never seen anyone act scared until you've seen this). After a relatively slow opening that makes a point of portraying the lacklustre employment prospects of the town that our unconventional characters are stuck in, the piece kicks into gear and gets a handful of its players started on a journey that turns every bump in the road, every shift in suspension, every pebble in their path into deadly obstacles. This situation is milked for all it's worth; it grips you and never lets you go, forcing your heart into your mouth more times than you can count. It's soaked in dread, too. The film is definitely one of the - if not the - most suspenseful that I've ever seen. Frankly, it's a masterpiece.

Hunger is that one thing for which human can go onto risk his life without caring about sophisticated ways of fulfilling it. It can make you do anything, it increases the greed and then all left in human is nothing but a soulless money digger. The Wages Of Fear adduces stories of some men in French town who got no job to do but had to make a living. The company offers a high risk job on good wages to truck drivers and a few of them desirably accepts the tough task. All this journey of them driving to thier destination is thrilling and very natural but unfortunately it begins after a very slow and dull start. But once it begins, there is no slowing down to the following show and overall usability is served well if you can forgive the boring start. The entire narrative is very intensely formed and the formation of scenes is linearly correct. Besides, it wastes so much time to build the characters and pick up the main portion of the script. However, when it ends you don't feel disappointed despite some flaws. It could have been a much more greater film in early time but post 1950 cinema was moved way ahead. A major problem could be that this Italian-French drama didn't want to lose the essence and human factors and keep it close reality, in which it is definitely succeeded whereas theatrically it was slightly below the belt. Intense presence of Yves Montana and Charles Vanel is engaging amd noticeable. Henri-Georges Clouzot's direction is detailed, subtle and his solemn approch on the script is praiseworthy. Overall, this film manages to prove it's point of being socially important film and thats all matters the most. A very good attempt and certainly watchable film.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "An Italian-French thrilling drama of human battle on Ethereal thread between Hunger and Death.", "date": "2020-07-29T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5951397", "sentiment score": [0.0164, 0.0761, 0.3418, 0.516, 0.0496]}, {"content": "Splendid and famous movie by Henry-Georges Clouzot and remade by William Friedkin as \u00a8Sorcerer\u00a8 in 1977 .

As the company's cynical head has offered 2000 dollars to each man , enough to finance theit getaway from the hell-hole they live in .Exciting and thrilling movie which so entrapped us in following the misfortunes of the four men desperate enough to undertake a suicidal journey with a cargo of nitroglycerine along the dangerous jungle and cliffside roads . Multi-dimensional , twisted and complex drama concentrates on character development for the first half . The film contains nail-biting scenes as the cliff frames when a truck is hooked or the petroleum hole , crucial to the movie's greatness . Main role is grittily played by Yves Montand giving a wonderful acting . The remainder of the roles remain perfectly developed such as Charles Vanel , Folco Lulli , Peter Van Eyck and special appearance by Vera Clouzot , George Clouzot's wife .It packs a strirring and moving musical score by Georges Auric . As well as evocative and atmospheric black/white cinematography shot on location by cameraman Armand Thirard and in a finely restored version . The motion picture based on a novel written by Georges Arnaud was competently directed by Henry Georges Clouzot . He started his film career as a screenwriter and then Henri-Georges Clouzot switched over to directing in 1942 with Tout pour l'amour and The Murderer Lives at Number 21 . His films are typically relentless suspense thrillers , similar to Alfred Hitchcock's but with far less light relief . He had the distinction of having his film The craven (1943) prohibited by both the German forces occupying France and the Free French forces fighting them, but for different reasons . He shot to international fame with Jenny Lamour (1947) and especially Wages of fear (1953) and consolidated that success with other films as Race for Life (1956) , Les espions (1957) , La prisonni\u00e8re (1968) . He beat Alfred Hitchcock in buying the rights to \"Les Diaboliques\"(1955) with a margin of just a few hours , but continuous ill health caused large gaps in his output , and several projects had to be abandoned until his death .

If you thought OJ Simpson's slow speed chase was insane, you need to change the batteries in your pacemaker and check out \"Wages of Fear\". This 1953 French classic tells the story of a bunch of guys who are stuck in a squalid South American village--a sort of Casablaca-esque purgatory--and will do anything to get out, even if it means getting themselves blown sky high. Slow and lazy for the first half (deliberately), the plot eventually reveals itself to be about a suicide mission to haul a zillion gallons of nitroglycerine across 300 miles of harsh terrain that would make the Coyote & Roadrunner take an early retirement.Yes, nitro is that stuff that you don't want to look at the wrong way or it may send you to the moon. \"Wages of Fear\" ultimately reveals itself to be a gripping character study of how people keep their wits, or come unravelled, when subjected to pure terror... with of course the reward of heaven dangling just out of reach. So again we see this subtle allegory of purgatory, hell and heaven which I'm sure was the intent of director Henri-Georges Clouzot.An interesting point of historical note is that when this film was released in the USA, around 15 minutes of its 150 min running time were cut. According to the Criterion mini-documentary \"Censored\", these cuts were largely due to the \"anti-American\" themes (the tyrannical oil corporation that exploits the lives of locals for the sake of a buck) as well as subtle themes of spiritual cynicism (the beautifully poetic \"fence\" monologue which symbolizes the absence of God/afterlife). By today's standards these censored scenes are prime time tv, but back in the 50s this movie was feared by US censors as being godless pinko propaganda. That might put a smirk on your face as you're watching this flick. But definitely look for the full 150ish minute version of this film, not the 130 min censored cut.But really, for the entire second half there will be no smirking, only tense gritting of teeth as you watch these rolling nuke trucks inch across the South American jungle. The hazards they encounter, as well as their ingenious attempts to survive them, are extremely creative and expertly filmed with the sort of suspense that would make Hitchcock lose his breath.Content advisory stuff: There's a scene in the beginning where a fine tarantula specimen gets squashed. After rewinding and rewatching the scene in slo-mo a dozen times, I'm almost certain that our unfortunate arachnid was a fake prop. If anyone knows differently please mention it in a review. The same scene shows a naked woman from behind, at a distance. Later in the film is a scene that shows a topless native woman from a distance--it's very artistic. Language is tame throughout the movie with maybe 1 or 2 instances of \"merde\" (the sh- word). While there is violence, none of it is shown explicitly on camera (some of it is disturbing, though). And unless you're a 1950s American censorship bureaucrat, there's nothing politically incendiary other than the notion that the almighty dollar is the root of much misery.\"Wages of Fear\" is a well crafted, poetic, suspenseful film that certainly deserves its classic status in the history of cinema.

A perilous job opportunity emerges when the American corporation Southern Oil Company needs to transport nitroglycerin to extinguish a massive fire in the oil fields, four drivers are chosen to drive two trucks in conveyance of the highly explosive products in a 300-mile rugged haul, with no safety precautions at hand The sideswipe of American capitalistic avarice and callousness is pretty much in your face, yet, for these hardscrabble expatriates, $2,000 is an offer too tempting to refuse, after some backhanded maneuver Jo gets the last spot to drive with Mario, while Luigi is paired with Bimba (Van Eyck, stolid and unbelievably cool), a taciturn German who endures a dark past.Henceforth, Clouzot viz. the Gallic Hitchcock takes audience on an ensorceling edge-of-the-seat road trip where one single substantial bump can cause their trucks to be blown up to smithereens, like a ticking bomb hanging over our heads. Compelling set pieces, a gripping turn on the precipice, and detonating an obstructing rock, one mobile, one static, are textbook paragon of tension-building and suspense-eliciting, not to mention the effect graced by Georges Auric's captivating accidental music.However, physical obstacles aside, it is the mental exertion that takes a heavy toll en route, Jo, the hard-nosed, savvy spiv, gradually yields to the mounting fear and his cowardice starts to turn Mario from his toady to a hectoring boss, sending contempt and verbal abuse to a humiliated Jo, up to a merciless last-ditch attempt knowingly leaving him mortally wounded, here Clouzot's astutely differentiates true grit from Dutch courage, and examines the phallocratic pride with utter acumen, its reverberations is astounding, much also owing to the two protagonists' unyielding tours-de-force, especially Vanel, completely devotes himself to the grueling condition (that petrol wallowing sequence is awestruck), and more credibly, he tenaciously enlivens Jo's transformation from a despicable wide boy to a resigned old geezer, for whose aftermath we feel deeply sympathetic. Our compassion towards Montand's Mario also undergoes a sea change when the plot thickens, his raffish charm morphs into an admirable determination midway, until his ruthless color takes the upper hand, Montand perfectly showcases his marquee idol charisma, and his baptism-of-fire triumph is unqualifiedly hard-earned, but Clouzet ratchets up the morbid irony in its dizzy ending, as augured by its opening, the quartet's fate is hanging on the same thread, negligible, expendable and inescapable.Incontrovertibly, THE WAGES OF FEAR is a daunting progenitor for late comers to emulate but impossibly to surpass, denotes a hefty import of Clouzot's unrivaled cinematic legacy, that reinvented narrative cinema with its high-octane vicariousness.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 5, "votes": 5}, "heading": "THE WAGES OF FEAR denotes a hefty import of Clouzot's unrivaled cinematic legacy, that reinvented narrative cinema with its high-octane vicariousness", "date": "2018-06-25T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4215258", "sentiment score": [0.1008, 0.2315, 0.2407, 0.3434, 0.0836]}, {"content": "Clouzot tells a tale of suspense and drama that man finds himself captive to.

First off, the tension must be acknowledged. This is a true edge-of-your-seat film once it gets to the meat. Bsic plot summary; a group of men are stuck in a dead-end town in South America. They have no jobs, no money, no escape and no hope. The town is chained to the American oil company nearby. An sudden explosion at a derrick requires a powerful explosion to extinguish it, and a huge amount of nitroglycerin is the only solution. The only catch; someone needs to deliver a large amount to the remote rig. The job is near-suicidal, so they offer a large sum of money to those in the town who are brave enough to do it. Ultimately, four men are chosen from the town to deliver the incredibly dangerous cargo to the raging oil fire at prices that will deliver the desperate men from their misery in the dying town. Two teams of two men are tasked with driving gallons of unstable chemicals across impossibly rough and dangerous terrain. The slightest wrong move will end their lives in an instant. At face value, this could carry a film on it's own. The washboard scene alone, only a few films have managed to put me on such edge. The rock demolishing scene is another incredibly intense scene; pouring the nitroglycerin into the hole; the fear and risk is absolutely palpable, a credit to the excellent acting, direction and editing. The switchback scene, also, is a memorable event.But, and maybe more importantly, after the initial impact of the plot, you really get into the characters of the film. To me, the most fascinating character was Jo; we are introduced to him as a incredibly self-assured, in-control alpha male who knows how to handle any situation he encounters. The show-down at the cantina solidifies this image. We see Jo as the superior to Mario; a father figure who we expect to lead his younger compatriot. But as the film progresses, the roles switch as we see him for what he truly his; a fearful, risk-averse, cowardly old man. This character progression is so central to the action of the film. We experience what the average person might go through in a similar scenario, we see our weaker side in him when he flees the collapsing wooden bridge. We feel his defeat at the stronger personality of Mario at the crucial moment We understand his utter, fatalist acceptance of his true nature as a flawed human being. Which, at the end, makes his lat scenes so devastatingly powerful. We identify so strongly with him in the face of such impossible odds that it makes his ultimate fate so devastating; he sacrifices himself for his partner despite his numerous failings and the touching finality between the two masterfully brings the two characters together in the most realistically human of ways.I find the ending a bit melodramatic, a little rushed and frankly a little cliched. I won't spoil the ending but I felt like I knew what was going to happen before he even took the wheel of the truck to head home. This is probably my only gripe with an otherwise spectacular film.I'll admit, I find a lot of films from this era hackneyed and melodramatic.This one absolutely blew me away. An absolute classic.

There were at least a couple of Westerns along with straight dramas, but it didn't seem to matter the genre. A souped up hot rod carrying four quarts of nitro that just happened to be hanging around was used by the main character to destroy \"The Giant Gila Monster\" in a campy 1959 monster flick.Whatever the fascination with nitroglycerine, and it had to be it's unpredictability, the idea of carrying around a ton of it was the premise of this film, \"The Wages of Fear\". Actually, it was two trucks carrying a ton of nitro between them, I guess to heighten the drama and provide twice as much in the way of nerve shattering tension. The thing is, unlike a host of reviewers who hold the picture in the highest regard, I really didn't get a whole lot out of the movie.For starters, the first forty five minutes or so was used to introduce characters and situations that eventually had nothing to do with the outcome of the story. Yves Montand portrayed his character Mario well enough, but the guy was just a reprobate for the most part. He consistently berated the lovely saloon gal Linda (Vera Clouzot), and actually threw her in the dirt when he drove off on the mission to deliver the goods. Same thing with his partner Jo (Charles Vanel), who started the picture as one of film's ruggedest macho men, and turned into a cream puff when the going got tough. I just didn't understand how characters would just suddenly switch their basic personas as the story progressed.Then there's the adventure on the road. Maybe I missed it, but what was the rationale for that wooden bridge turnabout that both drivers had trouble with? Was it that the size of the trucks wouldn't allow for a smooth ninety degree turn? Even so, after the first mishap with the truck driven by Bimba (Peter van Eyck), why would Mario feel compelled to back his truck right to the very edge of the unstable platform? It didn't make sense to me.And then, showing his contempt for Jo, Mario runs him over in that manic oil pit scene. I have to admit, that was the stunner for this viewer. That scene had both actors earning their paycheck, and it rivals the clay pit scene in \"The Defiant Ones\" with Sidney Poitier and Tony Curtis for sheer insanity, in another Fifties action flick. Both are just hellacious, you be the judge.Except for that scene, most of the rest of the story didn't hold the same amount of interest for me. When the truck with Bimba and Luigi (Folco Lulli) blew up, I thought that it would have been better served if there was a close-up of the two men in the truck hitting a rut and offering a grimace just before fading to black and then showing the explosion. That would have better sealed their fate; I had to wonder why no one thought of it.With all that, I don't mean to imply this was a terrible picture. It's watchable enough, but just doesn't seem to measure up to the accolades it's given as an IMDb Top 250 film. But that's the case for a lot of others as well, so in this case, maybe it's just me.

Yves represents elegance in Foreign and American films. Wages of Fear is down right tense, disturbing, dirty and gritty from start to finish. Our story starts in a rural village somewhere in a remote section of South America. It's not quite clear where this place is which has me intrigued from the start.The towns people spoke French which I felt a gaze of wonderment. In addition to the remoteness of this town the only way back to France is the airport because the roads are dangerous. Passing deserted jungles and deserts along the way. Narrow roads protruding over cliffs make any journey heart wrenching to say the least.Our picture starts with four men. Frenchman Mario (Yves Montand) and his friend Jo (Charles Vanel). A German fellow named Bimba (Peter Van Eyck) and Italian Luigi (Folco Lulli). Work is hard to come by because this remote town is run by a corrupt American corporation SOC Southern Oil Corporation.This company is suspected of unethical practices, mainly exploiting worker and taking the law into it's own hands. The townspeople except the hardships anyway. Montand plays a gruff Corsican playboy who abuses his girlfriend Linda (Vera Clouzot) with contempt. His buddy Jo was an ex-con who feels stranded in this out of the way town. Bimba is an intense quiet man who worked in salt mine for six long years. Mario's close friend is Jo who talks about the old days when they both lived in Paris. Luigi has developed serious health issues due to collecting cement dust in his lungs. Meanwhile Jo feeling stranded is quick tempered with the other cantina regulars. Meanwhile a massive fire breaks out at an SOC Oil field some 500 kilometers from their town. Non unionized SOC truck drivers are needed to deliver nitroglycerin in two large barrels over rough terrain to quash the out of control flames. A perfect example of the company exploiting the locals into a dangerous situation for employment. The company institutes a lottery for applicants and The four men I mentioned previously where picked. A fellow by the name of Smerloff was originally picked but doesn't show so Jo takes that spot. A few years earlier Jo did some curry-favor with the American SOC foreman Bill O'Brien (William Tubbs) when they delivered illegal booze on the side. Jo shows signs of getting weak possibly local malaria and O'Brien partners him with Mario on this hazardous journey into the wilderness. The other two will drive the second truck 30 minutes behind Mario. Luigi and Bimba suspect that Jo murdered Smerloff to take that spot. So far this flick was only in French with English sub-titled and then the movie inverts to a brief English portion of the film as the SOC foreman Bill O'Brien lays down the plan and explains the nature of this dangerous mission to Non union four carrying liquid explosive. Paying each driver $2000.00 if they survive the journey to the oil fields. Driving ever so slowly through desolate areas over every obstacle imaginable. Director Henri Clouzot takes you along for one of the most suspenseful rides of your life. You feel the thirst and fever of our characters as at any moment their dreams would end in one huge explosion. Being stuck in an L.A. freeway traffic snarl or a flat tire on a rainy night would be an improvement as to what our men are faced with. The physical and mental anguish of the South American Back country. The cinematography places you riding shotgun, as every bump, precipice, pot hole ridden narrow road for at any moment one mistake and obliteration. I also viewed this movie as an Anti-American film. Big corporation taken advantage of the little town. I just felt for Mario and his chance to possibly start over again. A round about way of playing Russian roulette with Barrels of Nitro in the back just waiting to explode. I was mentally exhausted by films end.

They have no job prospects and they don't have the financial means required to leave the deadbeat town. Although the opening act of the film is a bit uneven,it still works to make the viewer well acquainted with the characters. Henri- Georges Clouzot manages to convey the utter disenchantment and poverty of the characters, which helps to underline why these men would feel desperate to find a way out of this town and will probably go to any lengths to materialise that. There is also a very clear anti-American capitalism statement being made in the opening act. The Southern Oil Company(SOC) who end up employing the men for the central mission is portrayed as this monstrously exploitative entity that doesn't care about people's lives as long as their materialistic oil needs are met. It is also interesting to note that the characters themselves remain pretty unlikable in the first part of the film. But when the come together in their mission and as we spend time with them on the road and fear for their lives, they become more and more engaging.As soon as the 4 primary characters jump on the trucks and start the mission, the film completely changes. It becomes a fascinatingly exciting, edge of the seat thrill-fest as the characters encounter and overcome a series of obstacles. This was my first viewing of a Clouzot film, but I can clearly see why he was nicknamed the 'French Hitchcock'. Clouzot's tour de force direction in each of these obstacle sequences is very reminiscent of Hitchcock. He ratchets up the tension through a combination of various elements like meticulous use of silence and ambient noises, precise camera placement and absolutely pitch perfect editing. I think every single person watching this film will at at least some point or another find themselves on the edge of the seat during the film due to the sheer effectiveness of the white-knuckle-ride experience that ' The Wages of Fear' offers.A clear theme that is being explored in the film is the irony and the mysterious ways of the concept of fate and mortality. The manner in which all the characters meet their respective fates in the film are genuinely unpredictable, sudden and unquestionably ironic.In conclusion, 'The Wages of Fear' is a must watch for everyone as it has something to offer for fans of a wide range of genres.

The only problem being that they don't have the safety equipment needed to transport the nitro from the village.

This part creates the necessary atmosphere and character development. Relationship between the protagonists are not explained. Each one acts on impulse and in their own way to cope with the agony brought by poverty and unemployment. As rescue appears cruel form of economic and corporate imperialism.

For Europeans who live there, jobs, no matter how dangerous it was, the rescue or escape from the everyday agony. Then comes the sudden turn in a story that gets qualities of existential and adventurous thriller.Excitement, tension, danger and ice uncertainty.This is a strange blend of action and human reactions. The path of salvation through a nightmare. This approach awakens the worst and the best in man. The lack of sentimentality has contributed to the reality of the experience. This is a harsh struggle for survival.I wondered whether the protagonists actually brave, or just desperate and hopeless. End of the film did not need to be so ironic. Well, probably it was a low blow to the Hollywood thriller. Yves Montand as Mario is brave and ruthless character. In the end, his madness cost him life. Charles Vanel as Jo is a former gangster at all costs trying to flee the city. It's too dangerous to work and quite a coward when push comes to shove. I would not say that his life is more valuable.

When there is an explosion at one of SOC's wells it is determined that the only way to put the fire out will be to blow it out using nitro-glycerine\u0085 the problem is they don't have specialised transporters and the well is a few hundred miles away over rough roads. Four men are required to drive two trucks there; the slightest bump could cause an explosion that would mean instant death but the $2000 per man would pay for them to get home.The four men are a young Corsican named Mario, an older Parisian named Jo, who travel in the larger truck, and Italian named Luigi and Bimba, a Dutchman who had survived being a prisoner of the Nazis, in the second truck.

It's a taut, superbly suspenseful thriller, guided with a steady hand by director Henri-Georges Clouzot, who would go on to direct the classic Diabolique in 1955.Yves Montand, in a rare dramatic role, plays Mario, the ostensible protagonist of our tale. He's been stuck in this backwater for some time, but it costs a lot of money to get out \u2013 plane fares are through the roof, and there's no train, and there's no neighboring village. In short, you're stuck there until you can buy a ticket \u2013 and pay for a passport, of course.Mario spends his days looking for work, wooing tavern worker Linda, and despairing about the lack of work. There's an American oil company in town, but they're no longer hiring. His monotonous lifestyle is interrupted by the arrival of fellow expat Jo (Charles Vanel), a tough-looking older man who quickly wins Mario's favor at the expense of the rest of the men in town.The oil company, in fact, has its own problem \u2013 one of their large derricks has exploded, causing a huge oil fire. Company man Bill O'Brien decides to send two trucks loaded with nitro from the town up the mountain to the derrick. (The eventual idea is to set off charges, which will somehow contain or extinguish the fire.) O'Brien has no trouble scaring up volunteers for the task, since the men of the town are largely unemployed. Four men will be selected to take the two trucks. Only one truck is needed; the second is truly just in case there's an accident with the first one. The men will receive $2000 when the work is finished, more than enough to secure passage out of the backwater.Mario and Jo are chosen, as are Mario's roommate Luigi (Folco Lulli) and German expat Bimba (Peter van Eyck). The two trucks depart early in the morning, full of gas and of nitro. Danger awaits.Theirs is not an easy task. The road is full of ruts. In one place, the wooden deck that trucks use to make a sharp turn up the mountain has been damaged from disuse. It's hot and muggy. And one has to be very, very careful, as even the smallest bump might set the whole shebang off. There's also tension among the four drivers \u2013 Luigi is unhappy that Mario is spending more time with Jo than with him, Mario is unhappy with what he perceives as Jo's cowardice. Bimba seems to get along with everyone, though.The whole time I was watching this movie, I was certain not all four were going to make it. I will not spoil what is now a sixty-three-year-old movie, but I was still genuinely surprised by the ending. This ain't no fairy tale or sitcom. This is a movie about desperation, redemption, sacrifice, and comeuppance. It's not necessarily about justice.The Wages of Fear is a singularly terrific movie from start to finish, exquisitely shot and expertly written. Its money maker is its tension, something present here in spades. The writing is impeccable; even personality changes make perfect sense within the film's context.

Taking part in \"shady\" dealings,the company gets a tight grip on the town,which forces the people to stay silent over the abuses,due to it offering the only jobs in town.Discovering that one of the oil fields has erupted,the company decide that the only way to stop it is to use nitroglycerine.Going round town offering a handful of cash,the company grab the attention of ex-gangster Jo,the quiet Bimba,the quick-witted Mario and the warm, hard working Luigi. Getting told that they have to drop the nitroglycerine off to the oil field in trucks,the gang soon discover one major,risky problem:the oil field is 300 miles away on a road of death.View on the film:Flying in at 2 and a half hours,co-writer/(along with J\u00e9r\u00f4me G\u00e9ronimi) director Henri-Georges Clouzot (who broke a leg whilst filming) and cinematographer Armand Thirard sink the trucks into an engulfing Film Noir atmosphere,where low-lighting allows the smallest glimmer of hope to be seen in the town. Keeping a close eye on every turning of the wheels,Clouzot brilliantly uses tightly held,lingering shots to build a mood brimming with anxiety over the title.Stomping down the Film Noir road, Clouzot makes every sharp turn land with an unrelenting thump,by blazing down scorching hot whites with mud and grit gathering every drop of sweat,which is burnt away by the oily Film Noir doom being lit on the horizon.Piped down from Georges Arnaud's novel,the screenplay by Clouzot and G\u00e9ronimi beautifully spends the first hour giving the viewer an opportunity to (almost) interact with each character,from Mario's abrasive,Film Noir loner nature, to Jo's sincere desire to drive by the Film Noir darkness. Expanding on one of his major themes drawn from the very beginning of his credits,Clouzot gives the characters an inability to escape from the Film Noir oil fields that they are driving into,by making each pedal pressed pull them all away from a paternally safe \"stop point\",into a decaying road of ruthless doom,paved with grubby cash. Grabbing the role after Jean Gabin turned it down for the character being a \"coward\", Charles Vanel gives an incredible performance as Mario,thanks to Vanel keeping Mario's humble roots shining as the oil of Film Noir streams over Jo and Mario.

There are some moments where a bit more attention to logic and detail would have hoisted it so much higher around attention risk and explosives.Why they are transporting Nitro long after Nobel had stabilised it to Dynamite is not clear.

A bit of Cirque Du Soleil wobbling on OHS nightmare planks whilst loading the goods by the 'workers' presages impending events. Generally though it holds up reasonably well until the boulder in the road.It takes much 'golly gosh darn why us?' before note they note they have explosives... (wow!) which would be the first choice of any road builder. Luigi hops up and 'drills a neat hole with a steel bar the size of a mans forearm in the time it takes Bimba who seems to know his stuff, to wobble precariously off the truck with a jerry can of Nitro, and set himself up for a Nitro Head Spliter by syphoning it orally. The 'rope' suspending the hammer is clearly safety fuse but logical they had some with the Nitro but no detonators. Not 'rope'. Now this is lit and suddenly they remember, having backed up the trucks, the 'rock rain'. Too late. This is where Gerard Depardieu in Jean De Florette wears it. Salaud! But given the size of the flask and the position in the sometime porous rock it would be unlikely to project upwards. And miraculously the road is clear bar a black patch of burnt ah... imagination. Now we get to the Luigi and Bimba crater. No sing of the truck or the guys: given blast is going down and forwards in respect of the truck. No metal nothing. They have I think 42 cans each assume 5 gallon each. So about 800 litres. One lunch thermos full produces blast 1 (rock) whilst 42 cans produces blast B. Um.

I recall 'Mario running down Jo' years ago as a kid. It stayed with me. OBriens voice in the office sounds like Daniel Plainview (There Will Be Blood 2007), and the sense of trapped listlessness in the town at the start echoes the despair in Heart of Darkness (Conrad) and recalls parts of The Passenger (Antonioni) and goes some way to explaining the behaviour of the characters. All filmed in France too.The ending? A 'moral ending' with the wages of xyz in his pocket was 'correct' if rather illogical & smacked of 'how can we finish this?' Mario oblivious to basic risk having survived the trauma of the scenario and killing Jo, then literally waltzes off the road with his money.Salaud!

In spite of the fact that the solid performances by the four leading actors and Armand Thirard's cinematography remain effective (and in spite of the criteria of the Criterion company, which has become some sort of \"film Bible\" for many unbaptized in the immensely wide scope of world cinema), the flaws are more evident now. To start with the 39- minute first act is quite hard to follow, especially for a Spanish- speaking person like me: in the novel the action takes place in Guatemala (Central America) , but where does this movie take place, where is this place called Las Piedras that by 1953 still has creoles talking with Spaniards' accents, where indigenous dress as Andean people or undress like Amazonian tribes? The closest town to Las Piedras seems to be Caracas (capital of Venezuela, South America) as seen in a sign of plane fares, or it could be Tegucigalpa (capital of Honduras, Central America) according to a dialog: you take your pick. All this mishmash is possible, yes, but at least I could not deal with the endless parade of offensive \"Latino\" stereotypes, from the taxi driver who stops his car precisely in the middle of a mud pond, the barefoot venal black immigrant officer or the sweaty and greasy owner of \"El Corsario Negro\". Then take act two, which as Georges Arnaud's novel is also the weakest dramatic section of the movie, since the characters have been well established in the first act. So this is mainly a block of action sequences in which the nitroglycerin-loaded trucks go from one obstacle to the next, to reach their goal, the oil field in flames. Admittedly a couple of the pieces are real gems (the long sequence of the rotten-wood platform or the solution to take a huge boulder out of the road), but it is just that, a chain of obstructions and how to deal with them. The last act centers on the persistence of the two surviving truck drivers, leading to a surprise ending that seems too moralistic after everything we have seen before, when all the characters we have seen since the beginning deserve a similar conclusion. As for the critic of American companies in foreign lands, today that is no news and it can also be said of European and Asian enterprises in those alien territories, as well as the local companies: they all give similar ruthless treatment to workers (and the land itself). This is the kind of commercial \"macho movie\" that asks for a remake among the action film crowd.

Certainly amongst the finest examples of suspense in cinema history, the thrilling manner in which it manages to sustain its nail-biting tension for the majority of its runtime makes it an instant classic.Set in an isolated South American village, The Wages of Fear tells the story of 4 men who in order to escape from their miserable lives accept a handsome-paying but highly-dangerous job of driving two trucks over mountain dirt roads. The trucks are loaded with the extremely volatile nitroglycerine which might go off at the slightest bump, thus required extra attention on the part of the drivers.Co-written & directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot, the first hour of The Wages of Fear isn't an easy sit for the picture takes its time to introduce & acquaint its characters but once those trucks start moving, every single moment that follows is an edge-of-the-seat stuff for there is a foreboding sense of tension that looms over the film throughout its remaining runtime.Shot in crisp black n white, Cinematography makes excellent use of camera plus its clever execution single-handedly elevated those suspenseful moments to a nerve-wracking level. Editing could've done away with more sequences in the first hour but it's perfect in the later half. Sound design also deserves a mention for it plays a key role in keeping the suspense alive.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Yves Montand, Charles Vanel, Peter van Eyck, Folco Lulli & V\u00e9ra Clouzot, and their input is as commendable as it is valuable to the story although Mrs. Clouzot does go a bit overboard at times. But what impressed me the most about these characters is that each one of them has their own identity, their own history & their own fear plus their chemistry with each other is pretty much spot-on.On an overall scale, The Wages of Fear is certainly amongst the greatest films of the 1950s & is a cinematic treasure whose quality will never be diminished by the test of time.

After seeing it I have to admit I felt rather disappointed by it There's a good story at the core . A handful of men are paid by an oil company to transport nitroglycerin through a South American jungle . Nitroglycerin as you might know is a highly volatile explosive substance . Shake it about then it's BOOM BANG and there's not enough of you left to have a proper funeral , only a memorial service .

In its tenseness, as symbolized by the danger of explosion of the lorries' loads, it has hardly been surpassed.The plot is perfectly worked out from start to end, the leading players act in some of their best parts ever, the (almost) absence of music supports the brutal realism and the consequent choice of authentic outdoor settings contributed a lot to the film's deserved success.

But as lofty and abstract as Clouzot's allegory may be, his execution is vibrantly physical and immediate. Turning the screws with a relentlessness that impresses even in this age of the ruthless, high-tech thriller, Clouzot strings together situations of vividly, almost sadistically imagined danger. Set in the sunbaked, impoverished, dusty, fictional banana republic of Las Piedras in Latin America that is under the thumb of an American oil company, 'The Wages of Fear' adopts a fable-like form. The town is bursting with desperate foreign derelicts, stranded there without money and who will do anything to earn the price of a ticket back to civilization. When the American oil company needs two truckloads of volatile nitroglycerine to put out a runaway fire at a remote oil-drilling site, a desperate foursome belonging to different points on the map is hired to man the two trucks for 300 miles through a treacherous terrain, at the end of which liberation lies. The wages of their fears will be salvation. The trucks are equipped with nothing more than ordinary spring suspensions. They are only given a 50-50 chance, but are offered good pay ($2,000 for one week of work). Now the excitement begins!When Clouzot's quartet decides to take up the job, the motive is greed and the results are as black a vision of human infidelity as any. The cliff-edge tension is nerve-wracking as they stumble upon one roadblock after another \u2013 a hairpin curve, a boulder on the road, passing through an obstructing pool of oil, riding for long stretches with explosives on roads that are bumpy and finally their own stress. Henri-Georges Clouzot successfully conveys both- situations that shiver with ice- cold suspense and the downbeat theme of fear and its various manifestations, with exceptional stewardship.The Wages of Fear is a frantic, vicious, existentialist howl that not only manages to laugh; it goes grinning into the void.

But then change comes when a major fire breaks out at the oil drilling site, the oil company needs to find and hire men who are willing to take a risky journey to transport highly volatile nitroglycerine across rough terrain and virtually abandoned bumpy roads, four men are hired to drive two trucks: sarcastic Corsican playboy Mario (Yves Montand) and French aging ex-gangster Jo (Charles Vanel), and Mario's Dutch roommate Luigi (Folco Lulli) and quiet but intense salt mine worker Bimba (Peter van Eyck). On the journey the trucks encounter many perils, not just the bumpy road and having to drive at a steady pace to not explode, but tight roads to turn, unstable bridges and structures to cross and reverse on, large rocks in the middle of the road that they need to blow up to remove, and when one of the trucks explodes it leaves behind a deep puddle of oil to trawl through. The four men accepted the job because of the money being offered was more than enough to allow them to leave once the job is done, but with the job being so dangerous few people expected them to return alive, in the end Luigi and Bimba were killed with their truck exploding, Jo dies from severe injuries, and Mario is the only driver to make it safely to the oil drilling site to assist the fire, he is ecstatic to drive away in the empty truck and return to devoted lover Linda (V\u00e9ra Clouzot), but careless driving means it is a shocking and fateful end for Mario.

The movie starts with the arrival of one mafia-like gentlemen named Jo into the small village looking for an opportunity to make money.

The other two future drivers are locals who have learned that you have to work for the American company to survive , but one named Luigi decides to take this new job after contracting concrete in his lungs from his current position. The director, Henri-Georges Clouzot, sets the stage by introducing the characters and the area for at least 30 minutes before introducing the main plot line. The explosives that they are carrying in the trucks are very brittle and this is shown to the interviewees so that they understand the danger involved. These folks though, have nothing to lose --- and so they pursue the possibility of $2000 per person without a whole lot of reservation.

It's a job, it pays well, those guys are the best in it but it's a hard, dangerous and exhausting service that can cost their lives. All the way, almost like descending to hell. This is the road to hell. It's a story about the battle between courage and cowardice and how fear can take over even the bravest of souls. This is Henri-Georges Clouzot masterpiece along with the equally brilliant \"Les Diaboliques\", both featuring a tension that rises into an endless crescent that never leaves you at ease.I saw \"Sorcerer\" (the American remake), read Georges Arnaud's novel and watched this film. To me, they all stand on the same level. They're incredibly good, very exciting but they're not great. Arnaud focus more on the mission's perils rather than the characters and sometimes the story doesn't turn to other interesting possibilities; neither Clouzot or Friedkin films are the book, lacking of some of its good ideas but developing some new ones.\"Sorcerer\" is an adventure about mercenaries looking for money and thrilling experiences while \"The Wages of Fear\" is a human drama about desperate people risking their lives to earn a living in the only possible way, and therefore more realistic than its remake. But Clouzot is a master in creating scary and real danger at practically every frame. A bar fight against local power man; the training closely observed by their patrons with conductors sabotaging each other; a truck making a difficult turn in a place that threats to collapse at any moment; the fear in the drivers eyes and hands, maneuvering as if each turn could be the last. The director delivers one of the most inspired and frightening moments of all time (not present in the book) when a giant stone stands on their way and the solution found to remove it to use part of the explosives. Heart couldn't handle very well that scene so perfectly made, with no soundtrack, very few dialogs and a constant action. And you relate very easily with the characters struggle, amazingly performed by Yves Montand (and I could never imagine him in such role, one of his earliest), Charles Vanel, Peter van Eyck and Folco Lulli, similar in being all afraid of what they're doing but their fears are expressed in many different ways. Some panic, some control it, others disguise from time to time trying to look adventurous. The difficulties I had with this were the erratic and long introduction of each character, too many humored bits that weren't so effective (those could have been easily trimmed down) and the ending - not in the sense of being a let down but its goofy presentation seems awkward. The treatment given to the theme, the heart of the matter which is their mission and the rest (even the romance involving Montand and the girl, which is slightly distractive but useful) achieves a positive result. Certainly a movie of a different level and exciting even today. 21st Century flicks can only aspire to be something like this. Call me crazy, but Hollywood can even try again with a remake but this time read the novel, make wise choices and you might reach something similar or better.

The catch is that nitroglycerin is an extremely dangerous substance that has to be handled with extreme caution. Thus one bad bump in the road could be the end for these men. Along the way then encounter all sorts of obstacles, including each other. But they have no choice but to press on, desperate for the money that awaits them at the end of their treacherous journey.The Wages of Fear captures what true suspense is all about. The film is full of incredibly high tension scenes that will leave you on the edge of your seat in stomach churning anxiety. You feel every drop of anguish the characters feel as they run into obstacle after obstacle, growing more and more tired and frustrated with their circumstances.

Some are desperate for the cash and will stop at nothing, even if it means risking not just their life, but everyone else's as well. Then there are those who would rather give up when things become too harrowing and too risky. The clashing of these two ideas create some intense scenes of psychological anguish. The ironic thing is that these four characters begin the film as friends, but the journey transforms them and turns them against each other in thrilling and disturbing ways. The film has a fantastic script which examines these things intensely and eloquently.

Jo is an aging ex-gangster who doesn't seem to be afraid of anything. They are both on a mission to deliver nitroglycerine, without any safety equipment and through an ill- maintained road. But as the journey goes on, the sides starts reversing. Age is catching up with Jo, he is afraid and has a bad case of nerves. And as Mario becomes more confident he starts despising Joe and treating him as his lackey.An amazing and interesting thriller with a bonus of a gripping psychological drama.", "rating": 5, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 8}, "heading": "Highly Original and Riveting", "date": "2011-05-23T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2432466", "sentiment score": [0.0037, 0.0189, 0.052, 0.4605, 0.4649]}, {"content": "Gripping, dark, intense \u0085 never has my heart's resistance been so challenged. Once the trucks took off to their hellish journey, I was literally grabbed, accompanying these four unsung heroes, like another passenger ... along with the haunting presence of death\u0085 Henri-George Clouzot, Hitchock's most valuable rival, made suspense films with a sadistic nerve and a humanistic genius, he defined suspense even better than the Master. Hitch said when two fellows are dining in a restaurant, and the table explodes \u0085 you understand there was a bomb underneath. It's surprise, but no suspense. Suspense is, according to Hitch, when you KNOW there is a bomb, and you want the two guys to leave the table, because you know WHEN it will explode. I humbly and respectfully disagree \u0085 For me, suspense is precisely when you know there is a bomb, BUT you don't know when it'll explode. It's suspense when any second can take you off your seat. And in \"Wages of Fear\", four men volunteer to transport nitroglycerin by trucks. Any blow, any shock, and they're gone \u0085 they know, we know, the only unknown here is \u0085 \"When?\"\"When?\" illustrates the truth that fear is an emotion connected with the future. Past can be repressed, present is a soon-to-be past, but future scares. And when you know, you drive a truck that can explode at any moment; you're tormented between two contradictory feelings: that you might die and that you can't die. Self-preservation is a so incompatible instinct for such a mission, that the only character we understand is Jo, Charles Vanel in a breathtaking performance. Jo perfectly embodies the idea that fear is a fear of the future, his past; his gangster past is used as a mask to impress the others. He even fools us in the beginning as we believe he'll be the ultimate bad-ass, contrasting with the kindness and romantic side of Mario, Yves Montand as his partner, the joviality of Luigi the Italian, and Bimba, the Dutch whose laconic tone, and avarice of lines, draw a perpetual enigma in his face. They're the courageous drivers of the trucks of doom. Jo is the bravest before the mission, but when it starts, the inconceivability of his death makes his nerves finally crack, in a pathetic cowardice that doesn't belittle his manhood anyway.\"Wages of Fear\" is a fascinating character study about how far, desperate and jobless men would go. I know I should have started with the beginning, but I don't think I have as many time as Clouzot had to plunge us in this fascinating universe, this South American town in the middle of a desert, populated by foreign workers who spend their time, trying to find a way to spend it, a rich and colorful, multicultural atmosphere that makes us forget about the mission \u0085 we get used to this boredom, a kind of 'Hustonian' melancholy where the losers, don't lose this pleasant ability to be themselves, despite the adversity \u0085 and flirting with a pretty girl, who likes to acts like your little cat \u0085 Vera Clouzot as the sweet and innocent waitress Linda, is like a female incarnation of these men who're the real sheep in a land when the wolf is the unethical American Southern Oil Corporation (SOC), a Sierra Madre whose only treasure is a suicidal mission, rewarded by 2000 dollars.SOC will play the pivotal role by hiring men for the suicidal mission. Transporting trucks of nitroglycerin to the Oil fields ignited by a gigantic fire, which only an explosion can extinguish. It takes a lot of guts to accept this mission, the men are so eager to leave the town; you wonder how they came here in the first place. I think it's because they don't belong to anything, no country, no union, no family \u0085 their lives are maybe more uncertain than their death, which at this point looks more promising. But self-control and determination have to be proved during the mission. As one Texan said, fear inhabits you forever. Later, Jo reminds us of the way, fear is an emotion that you can't talk about, only live it \u0085 and it takes a non-heroic but no less admirable courage to reckon his fears, like Luigi when he didn't want to fight Jo, like Jo when he admitted he was scared \u0085And during this captivating road to an imminent death, the imminence of an explosion is always teasing your thoughts, on the 'washboard' road, it's probably the most suspenseful movie sequence ever, the two trucks are about to collide, one can't accelerate before one point, the look on their eyes, the sweat on their foreheads, and me, holding my breath, waiting for the explosion \u0085 then they met a platform above a precipice, a boulder blocking the road, and the explosion, well, let's say that \u0085 even though I expected a truck explosion, it managed to surprise me, and to shock me. THIS is suspense \u0085If you read this, you know how it ends, and I guess the ending works as a the second plot twist, the first one being Jo's real personality \u0085 life in its splendidly despicable irony, you literally waltz with death until it dumps you at the unfortunate second you lower your guard \u0085 Was he stupid to be so dangerously jubilant? I think it depends on how we see things, if you know, you'll die, you're scared, if you think providence will spare you now, you're screwed. Tragic, it's the film noir, noir like nowhere, the nihilistic optimism that inspire the most heroic but ultimately tragic actions. And how ironic to realize at the end that fear is not necessarily bad, Jo was probably the most intelligent because he valued his life, where the others, sick, lunatic or romantic didn't see the danger ...

It actually has a pretty good premise, lots of action movies now days would be jealous off. However it doesn't really make this movie a fantastic or spectacular one to watch, though I'm taking it into account that this movie was from before the period that the action-genre got actually first fully developed. But by saying all this, you shouldn't think that this is an action packed movie with gun fights or anything but it's more a movie that takes an action type of approach with its style and story-telling, of its somewhat adventurous story, that gets brought very tense to the screen.I really had quite some problems with this movie. One is not even it's long running time of two and an half hours but more its set-up of its story and characters. Once you start thinking about it you should wonder of the first 30 minutes, or so, were truly needed for the movie or not. It's unnecessarily slow and it was mostly meant to introduce and set-up its character but they could had done this all a lot quicker really. And the characters aren't even that much good to begin with. Problem with them is that are some lying and cheating bums, who do everything for some money. I just could never fully like any of them, so therefore the movie already fell emotionally flat and became a distant one to watch.But yes, it's definitely true that the movie becomes a much better one to watch in its second half, when finally good and interesting things start to happen. They came up with some pretty good moments for the movie, that often work out real tense. They are being build-up well and executed surprisingly good and also original.But no matter how original the movie gets with some of its moments, the movie remains a very predictable one, or at least to me it was. I was not even surprised or taken away by its not-so-Hollywood-like ending. It got done a bit too obvious, in its build up toward it.Nevertheless this movie still remains a great and also unique achievement, from director Henri-Georges Clouzot. It's a French movie, in which a whole lot of different languages gets spoken by its characters. Besides French we have Italian, Spanish, English and some German, just to name a few languages that get spoken throughout this movie. It's simply a well directed and also good looking movie, aside from its settings that don't really seem to suit the movie its premise.The movie is supposedly set in an unnamed South-American country but the movie looks nothing like a South-American country at all. At first I even thought that the movie was being set in Marocco (also due to the many different languages being spoken in it) or some other northern African country. It's just one of those other little things that prevented me from truly getting in this movie and liking it as much as everybody else seems to do.It's a good movie, especially for its time but there was nothing in this movie that was surprising or truly grabbing me.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 10}, "heading": "I just don't see why most people think it's one of the greatest.", "date": "2010-10-01T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2318079", "sentiment score": [0.0518, 0.4085, 0.4313, 0.1022, 0.0063]}, {"content": "Four unsavory down-and-outs whiling away their hours in a poverty-stricken South American village accept the fool's errand of transporting two truckloads of nitroglycerin across terrible roads to an oil company accident site.

Director Clouzot packs his frame with things to look at, and the village, though built specifically for the movie, reeks of authenticity. The mise-en-scene alone is fascinating to watch -- some incidental action going on in the background of one shot (like a hothead smacking his girlfriend) is then picked up as the principal action in the next scene. And the Blu-Ray looks terrific; every mud puddle and heat-dazed fly is clear as a bell.The second half of the film is pure suspense. It's a study in male machismo and one-upsmanship. The oldest member of the group, who struts around like Mr. Big Shot in the town when he has nothing to fear, crumples like a baby when faced with the prospect of death for real.

First of all, everyone likes and admires Clouzot as a director. Secondly, there has been a lot of affectionate admiration for Yves Montand over the decades. So the reverence shown to this particular film has been tinted with the rosy view of retrospection and skewed in favour of 'good old Clouzot' and 'good old Yves'. But the performance of the young Yves Montand in this film, while good, is not in any way remarkable, and the part could have been played just as well by any fifty other actors. In other words, the reputation of this film has been artificially inflated. In actuality, it is far inferior to many of Clouzot's other films. It is difficult to know why Clouzot even wanted to make such a strange and stressful film. It is extremely painful to watch, for almost every minute of screen time, and it is never enjoyable. Surely we all have enough problems in our lives without having to worry about people being blown up by nitroglycerine which they are driving in large trucks on pot-holed roads in a desert. Yes, the film has various creative shots and sequences: the shot where Montand jumps down onto some loose soil and it sprays all over the camera, the sequence of the waltz scene in the seedy bar near the end, especially as intercut with Montand's joyous driving antics. Those things are all touches of the master. But \u0085 and I repeat, but \u0085 but. WHY?? Once again I raise the question which I raise in numerous reviews of films by many directors who make needlessly unpleasant films: why would the director want to make this film? Surely some more worthwhile subject and project could have been chosen for that year of Clouzot's life. Why do directors time and again, apparently for reasons of vanity or perverted notions, make really disgusting films? Everyone in this film except for the pathetic simple-minded maid in the seedy bar is horrible and disgusting, lacking in any positive qualities of any kind. Not one has an iota of compassion or concern for anyone but himself, and most of them are greedy, selfish, violent, criminal, and utterly revolting. A great subject for a movie, then! The film is set in a kind of 'nowhere', which might be Mexico or might be Venezuela, in any case, a country where the rapacious American oil company called 'Southern Oil Company' drills for oil at the cost of the lives of the locals, many of whom are killed in the most horrible accidents, and no one gives a damn. The setting is so grim and forlorn that it is a real wrist-slasher of an experience just to see it on film. Everybody is starving, everybody is penniless, everybody is exploited, everybody is miserable. What a cheerful experience! There is a very touching scene in the film between Montand and a friend who is dying in his arms, when the dying man suddenly reminisces about Paris. For the entire film, Montand has pathetically saved and frequently shown to his friends the Paris Metro ticket from Pigalle station which he used the last time he left Paris. Now, the friend suddenly starts talking about the Rue Galande, a charming little street near the ancient churches of St. Severin and St. Julien le Pauvre. (Rue Galande is also very near the street where Elliott Paul lived, which he described in his famous novel 'The Last Time I Saw Paris', and its sequel.) Montand says he knows the street very well also, so together they discuss the various shops they knew, and they try to remember whether the fence is still there which had obstructed the view of what was inside. The friend says he never could see what was behind the fence. Montand says there was nothing behind it. The friend is distraught, and, looking into Eternity, says: 'So there is just nothing?' and dies. Certainly the director's attention to detail of the transportation of a volatile explosive in impossible conditions by men desperate for money creates fantastic tension, and is gruelling in the extreme. But I don't see why we should give a damn whether those men are blown up or not, frankly, as none of them is sympathetic, and it is difficult to see what difference it makes to the Greater Scheme of Things whether Peter van Eyck and Yves Montand make it or not in their life of hell in that place of hell.

These are men without prospects or hope who've found themselves in a little South American village without money and jobs, who only dream of leaving and whom no one will miss if they die. That's what makes them so suitable for the oil company: they're dispensable.This is a fascinating premise for a suspenseful thriller. But Clouzot took too much time setting up the situation. The movie begins with impressive realistic shots of an ordinary day in a poverty-stricken, forsaken hell-hole where everyone is semi-naked or dirty, jobless, and suffering from the heat. It's a picture of filth, squalor and cruelty. But Clouzot's camera just keeps shooting filth, squalor and cruelty for almost an hour before the actual action starts. He made his point ten minutes into the movie, the rest was just pointless.I grew tired of the first hour because it lasted two long. But I also grew tired of Linda (played by the mediocre Vera Clouzot), the only female character in the movie, and the love interest of the main character, Mario (an amazing performance by Yves Montand). Watching the movie, I remember fearing Clouzot would find some way of putting her inside one of the trucks. Fortunately that didn't happen and once the four men leave the village, I didn't have to suffer Vera until the disappointing ending again.After the first hour the movie becomes thrilling; it becomes not only a fast-paced adventure thriller but also a meditation of courage, cowardice, the value of human life, the friendship and hatred that arises between men in difficult situations, and human ruthlessness. Clouzot does not portray mankind in a bright light. People, he says, under the lure of money, can and will do anything to succeed.Although Yves Montand was the main character, my hats are off to Charles Vanel for playing Jo, arguably the most complex character in the movie. Jo shows up in the little village and quickly fascinates Mario with his grace and calm demeanor under pressure. One can even say Mario worships him, following him everywhere around. But during the journey Jo reveals to be nothing but a coward, shattering Mario's illusions. Jo is fascinating because even though he's a coward and a hazard for the mission, there's something familiar in him that should draw sympathy and compassion from any person.The ending is a disappointment, like every movie by Clouzot I've seen tends to be. He seems to put happy endings where unhappy endings should be, unhappy ones in the place of happy ones, and moral ones where ambiguous ones should be. It's very strange.

It's a difficult title to live up to, but Clouzot knows precisely what he's doing, even if he seems to lack Hitchcock's distinctive sense of showmanship. What I've always loved about cinema is its ability to manipulate reality, to elicit genuine emotions from situations that, in real life, would seem mundane, or even ridiculous. An example I've used before, I believe, is Tarkovsky's 'Stalker (1979),' in which a peaceful and benign forest is inexplicably transformed into an environment of intense mystery and foreboding. Now consider 'The Wages of Fear,' when actor Peter van Eyck funnels what is probably water into a drilled hole in the rock. There's zero suspense in this simple act of pouring. However, taken within the context of the story, this water suddenly becomes nitroglycerine, and I got sore fingers from gripping the chair so tightly.'The Wages of Fear' contains two particular sequences that rival anything Hitchcock ever did in terms of suspense. In the first, to which I briefly alluded above, a small amount of nitroglycerine is utilised to demolish a huge boulder blocking the road, the slightest lapse in concentration certain to lead to disaster. In the second, Mario (Yves Montand) and Jo (Charles Vanel) wallow pathetically in a deepening pool of crude oil, drowning in the black tar of America's capitalistic greed {the motif of oil epitomising greed is not an uncommon one in cinema, and most recently turned up in P.T. Anderson's 'There Will Be Blood (2006)'}. What I think prevents Clouzot's film from being truly brilliant is the opening half-hour or so, which is not only unsuspenseful, but damn near uninteresting. Of course, I suppose, it's important to note the changes that take place in the characters both before and after their new job \u0096 the dominating Joe quickly reveals his cowardice, and the sycophantic Mario takes over the role of boss \u0096 but Hitchcock, at least, would have made these introductions far more compelling.Towards the film's ending, I have conflicting emotions. On the one hand, it is a wonderful masterwork of cinematography and editing, as Mario's driving is intercut with the waltz of his acquaintances back in town, to the tune of Strauss' \"The Blue Danube.\" There's an astonishing momentum to the camera movements; we foresee what is about to happen at least a minute before Montand's character does, but are powerless to stop it. He carries on his Dance Macabre (a figurative \"waltz with death\") until he loses control of the truck, begetting a spectacular, fiery plummet over the cliff edge. On the other hand, the entire incident \u0096 however satisfying filmically \u0096 doesn't seem like a natural progression of the narrative, possessing the air of a conclusion affixed only to achieve a surefire audience reaction. Unfortunately, similar cases of characters acting illogically litter the story, providing what might be described as mere cheap thrills: Mario continues to reverse the truck even after being told to stop, and Luigi, at one point, ludicrously decides to run towards an impending explosion rather than away from it.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 3}, "heading": "\"To get that bonus, they'll carry the entire charge on their backs\"", "date": "2009-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1999360", "sentiment score": [0.0267, 0.167, 0.321, 0.4136, 0.0716]}, {"content": "What can I say -- this is a fairly simple but excellent movie that has become a classic and is rightly considered must-see viewing by many movie buffs.

Henri-Georges Clouzot's \"The Wages of Fear\" is that kind of a thriller--one much more deeply invested in bringing out the nuances of the character than the sensationalistic impulses to blow stuff up, but nonetheless creating gripping, stylistically gorgeous drama.The story is about four men who are hired to drive two truck-fulls of nitroglycerin over a rocky mountain pass for use in extinguishing a oil rig fire. The infamously unstable nitroglycerin results in one of the slowest albeit extremely tension-filled races against time ever filmed in cinema (forget \"Vertical Limit\", this is the real deal). Every bump, every falling rock, every obstacle potentially becomes a life-threatening situation. Of course Clouzot gleefully sets everything he can within the limits of reality in their path.Of course, this main story begins after a long opening featuring the characters in a small, desolate South American town. The objective of these opening scenes are two-fold: to develop the characters so that their emotional reactions to the ride are more fully significant, and to provide a strong political commentary on the actions of oil companies (especially Standard Oil) in the region. A biting commentary it is, and no more distracting to the cause of the storytelling because of the way the characters are eventually treated. Jo's story is, of course, the most interesting of all, as he pretends to stand as the more comfortable, capable man of the world only to become the most cowardly. The beginning ultimately also justifies the ending.Of course, the main character we focus on isn't actually all that likable, and what's interesting is that's the point. Mario is abusive, self-centered, and rather narcissistic (though possibly not as much as the German fellow). His own fate is rather more fitting to the ending than a lot of people complain; I've heard some say that the ending is unnecessarily dark; I had to think awhile about it, but considering the rest of the movie I have to disagree.This is a movie that many film-buffs and up-and-coming filmmakers should make an extra effort to see. It's the type of movie that takes what is an almost shockingly simple premise and turns it into an intricate, involved character study, social drama, political commentary, and genre thriller film, all at once. It also shares aspects with Clouzot's famed noir \"Le Corbeau\".

If so, I recommend you watch Henri-Georges Clouzot's 1953 black and white masterpiece The Wages Of Fear (La Salaire De La Peur), about the evils of runaway greed and capitalism, all in the name of oil. It'll change your mind. Over half a century later, and in light of the current American war folly for oil in the Middle East, the film is remarkably resonant and cogent- even down to the loudest criticism of American profiteering and imperialism coming from\u0085.the French. However, when they're right they're right. If one wants to know why 'Ugly Americans' are loathed in the Middle East it's not because of the rhetorical claptrap about a 'clash of cultures', nor Evil vs. Freedom, but because of decades of exploitation where a select group of mainly American corporations, unanswerable to anyone, get rich off of exploiting the masses where they swoop in. It happened in the Middle East, as well as in Latin America- perhaps the only place in the world where anti-Americanism (really anti-American corporate imperialism) rivals or surpasses that in the Middle East. As a minor character in the film rails, 'Wherever there's oil, there's always Americans.' But, if all this film were was an anti-American screed it would still not grip viewers today. What it is, is a great portrait of the extremes that human beings- OK, men, will go to just to have things, and to what lengths their machismo will drive them.The film's screenplay was adapted by Clouzot and J\u00e9r\u00f4me G\u00e9ronimi (Clouzot's brother Jean's pseudonym) from a novel by Georges Arnaud, and, despite its nail-biting nature, as well as Clouzot's reputation as 'the French Hitchcock'- aka 'The Master Of Suspense', for such great thrillers as Diabolique (Les Diaboliques), this film is far beyond merely the technically great cinema that was Hitchcock's stock in trade. That's because it is not merely well made, but provokes deep questions about the fundamental nature of existence, human nature, and fraternity. It's far closer to something like John Huston's The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre (although it's a greater film), and its influence can be seen in many later films, such as Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch- in an opening shot of a naked child torturing cockroaches on a string, and Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time In The West, when we experience a good few silent minutes of opening shots on the squalid Latin American town, Las Piedras, the film is set in, just to get ambiance. Reputedly, the film was shot entirely over the course of a year, in southern France, in Camargue, with a few imported palm trees and cacti to give it a South American look, but one could not tell it from what is on screen. Clouzot is at his very best when drawing out the suspense, which, by definition, is the time between big events, the possibility of danger or horror, not the thing itself, which is usually anticlimactic. What the viewer imagines will always be more frightening than the reality, which is why the best suspense or horror films are usually those that are the least action-packed, show little of the monster, or are not dependent upon mere special effects. Yet, even when we know what will occur, the scenes are filmed so well as to draw the viewer in. This is particularly effective and true when Mario is shown slowly pulling the truck up off the bridge, and a metal hook from its side catches the bridge cable, and as the truck gets fully on the road, the bridge breaks below him. This sort of scene has been done many times before. Will it or will it not break? In a film as great as this, where all four main characters end up dead, to expect the cable to last is, at best, a crapshoot, or wishful thinking.It is the writing that sets the tenor of The Wages Of Fear, and what makes the suspense/thriller aspect of the film so great. Yet, what raises the film into the high art category is its blunt, simple, but never ham-handed, portrayal of the evils of corporate greed, and the sacrifice of human life so a select few can get rich, as well as the nihilistic despair that drives those who willingly play into their exploiters' hands. As rough as Clouzot is on the exploiters, he's even harsher on the meekly hypocritical exploited. Let Politically Correct Hollywood try that in one of their didactic screeds, and maybe there will be hope for American film.

Whereas others will seek the causality of their thriller in convoluted plots, police procedurals, supernatural killers and what not, Wages of Fear is content to be inspired and firmly grounded in reality. Four unemployed foreigners, trapped without visas somewhere in Latin America, are hired by an American oil company to drive two trucks filled with tons of nitroglycerin that is needed to kill the fire in a burning derrick. The wage is $2,000 each; a getaway ticket and a promise of luxury. But at what cost? The wages of fear indeed.At the hands of a lesser director, the premise could have been handled in a workmanlike way, with a movie-of-the-week attitude. Clouzot instead spends the first 50 minutes setting up a very believable world for the rest of the movie to unfold into. Not only is every player given his due shades of characterization, but their motives (escape from Latin America and money) become fully understood. The small town they live in is depicted as a living hell of sorts. Full of mosquitos, the scorching weather, impoverished natives, malaria, little food and money. The set-up is so expertly handled that the decision the characters have to make (take the job or not) becomes painfully obvious.And then comes the bulk of the movie. A grueling lesson in suspense that would make even Hitchcock himself green with envy. As if driving a ticking bomb through bumpy roads isn't enough, everything else that can go wrong does. Clouzot adds another layer of hard-hitting realism by making both the obstacles the characters have to overcome and their efforts to do so utterly believable and as hard as they appear to be. The total absence of music only enforces this sort of pain-staking realism. Even if it appears to be a little far-fetched at times; it's still a movie after all. But it's so far removed from the studio melodramas of the 50's that it shines by comparison. Just think of the relationship Mario, one of the drivers, has with a poor girl. What appears to be the requisite love story is turned on its head and becomes one of abuse and need. There's no \"I love you/ I love you too\" schmaltz to be found here. Some people may be too eager to accuse Clouzot of misogyny but I wonder where the line stops; is it the screenwriter, the director or simply what this character is all about. The way Mario treats the girl might leave an unpleasant aftertaste in one's mouth, but sometimes that's how life is. All the Hollywood sugar-coating in the world can't change that.A perfect companion piece to this kind of solid 50's film-making would be John Huston's Treasure of the Sierra Madre, if the analogy has any merit.

However, there are a couple of points which occurred to me as I watched it again yesterday.Firstly, the language. This is a truly multi-lingual film, and one of its chief joys for me is the wild multiplicity of thoroughly mangled foreign accents and the earthy, slang-filled dialogue. It's great to hear Italians and Germans and Americans talking in French, Frenchmen and Russians in English, Englishmen in Spanish. Eet iz as if I wurz to write ze 'ole of zis revieew lyik zis. And when the two French guys (Mario and Jo) are together, their speech is peppered with really down-to-earth slang and obscenities.The subtitles of my copy (although good) didn't always manage to convey the exact sense of the rough talk. One instance was blatantly censored; as Jo and Mario are leaving the depot with the laden trucks, O'Brien shouts a very male \"Merde!\" at them for luck: the subtitles' \"Break a leg!\" misses the muck a little. O'Brien tries again, with a more human \"Good luck, boys\", but Jo's response, hidden in the roar of the accelerating truck is, \"Et un Coca-Cola dans le c*n!\" For non-French speakers, men don't have one.The second point, neatly enough, follows on from that. Although movies can be \"about\" almost anything you want, Wages Of Fear presents us with an intense, highly-charged subtext of what it means to be a man and how men relate to each other. There is a whole load of unacknowledged sexuality just below the surface of this film - hey, Mario even gets to kiss Luigi - and I feel that any accusations of misogyny levelled at this movie need to be interpreted in a slightly wider context.I first saw Wages of Fear at an after-school film club over thirty years ago, where we were lucky enough to be introduced to a number of movie masterpieces by a teacher who simply adored good film-making.

The first hour is interesting but, to my mind, a bit slow. We spend a lot of time getting to know the squalor of Las Piedras. The anti-American point of view now just seems quaint. Las Piedras is a tiny South American (or possibly Central American) town that reeks of poverty and bakes in the hot sun. Children with sores, tired donkeys and mangy dogs fill the dirt streets. It's the final stop for down-and-outers whose only hope is to find work with the Southern Oil Company (you can infer SOC easily is a stand-in for Standard Oil), which dominates the place. \"Americans here? You kidding?\" says one man. \"If there's oil around they're not far behind,\" says his companion. SOC has a headquarters office in Las Piedras; the oil field is 300 miles away. Into this fly-infested hole arrives Jo (Charles Vanel), a tough, middle-aged French gangster out of luck and out of cash. He encounters Mario (Yves Montand), a ne'er-do-well in his twenties from Corsica who's stuck in Las Piedras. Mario does odd jobs to make enough money for meals and whiskey, beds and takes for granted the young woman who works at the town's cantina, and longs to get out of the place and back to Paris. The two of them bond in a way, the confident tough guy and the young, not-quite- amoral thug-in-training. The shifting relationship between these two is what drives the story; that they can get blown sky high at any moment after the first hour is what keeps us watching. When an oil fire erupts at a well head, Bill O'Brien (William Tubbs), the local American SOC boss, decides to send containers of nitroglycerin in two trucks from Las Piedras over three hundred miles of rocky, pot-holed road to put out the fire. He'll hire two men per truck and pay $2,000 per man for those who get through. The one drawback is that nitro is notoriously unstable, will explode in heat and if jostled and the trucks have no safety equipment. The visa-less bums, last chancers and sweating drunks stuck in Las Piedras line up. These are men who are so close to being the dregs of humanity you won't want to spend time standing next to them. You're not going to hire those tramps, one of O'Brien's subordinates says to him. O'Brien makes clear the film's point of view regarding American oil companies. \"Those bums,\" he says, \"don't have a union or any families, and if they blow up no one will come around for contributions.\" And so fifty-six minutes into the movie, Jo and Mario in one truck and Bimba (Peter van Eyck), a blond German, and Luigi (Folco Lulli), a happy Italian dying of lung disease from working in the SOC's cement operation, set off in their trucks. Even they begin to have second thoughts when they watch how slowly and carefully the jerry-cans of nitro are loaded. From now on we're in the cabs of those two trucks, sweating with the heat and our nerves. The road cuts through baking semi-desert, filled with potholes and rocks, and over mountains covered with scrub, shale and boulders. We've got to get through the washboard, a long stretch of dusty road carved into ruts by the wind. If the trucks keep going at 40 miles an hour, all is fine. Go under 40, \"boom.\" Go over and \"boom.\" There's a hairpin turn high on a mountain so sharp the trucks have to back onto a wooden platform to turn around. We find out the wood is rotten and the platform is shaky. There's a boulder as big as a truck that will have to be blasted apart...but only by using some of the nitro in a hazardous improvisation that requires siphoning, a falling hammer and a lit fuse. And worst of all is a large, expanding and deep pool of oil which will have to be driven through. By now we've come to know, if not especially like, these four men. Luigi is strong, coarse and relatively happy. Bimba is resourceful but fatalistic enough to make you a little nervous. Jo? He turns out not to be so tough after all, while Mario becomes the senior partner of the two, and determined enough to run a truck over a man's leg. How many survive? You'll need to see the movie. The ending is just right. Considering the passion French intellectuals have always had for smoking their Gauloises and condemning what they term American cultural and economic imperialism, Henri-Georges Clouzot makes his points but never at the expense of his film. The first hour may have messages to give, but they're understated and never smack anyone over the head. (However, the movie was cut by nearly an hour for it's initial American release. In addition to losing a fair amount of time in Las Piedras, all those anti-American swipes somehow disappeared.) The journey on the two trucks is so continuously gripping that any messages early on fall to the side of the road. Yves Montand, in one of his earliest movies, and Charles Vanel, an old hand, dominate The Wages of Fear. For those who recall Vanel only as the wily, good- humored police inspector in Clouzot's Diabolique, you're in for a master-class in the versatility of a first-class actor.

Most of the men hang around aimlessly, waiting for an opportunity to get out of there. When an unscrupulous American oil company offers big money to drive supplies of nitro-glycerine to put out a fire in an oil-field 300 miles away, four out-of-work men (Yves Montand, Charles Vanel, Folco Lulli and Peter Van Eyck) jump at the opportunity as a way out. The dangerous load of nitro-glycerine is to be delivered in two hulking trucks, and soon, a tense rivalry develops between the two sets of drivers, magnified by the unforgiving heat, the lure of filthy lucre and the rough and rocky roads where the slightest jolt can result in catastrophe.I am very much a devotee to many of Clouzot's other films, but with this film he never manages to get things on the right track, to get in the kind of rhythm he does so well in LE CORBEAU (1943) and LES DIABOLIQUES (1955). The set-up takes way too long, a full hour, and since Clouzot is not known for playful wit or humor, it's takes patience to get through the first half. Since most of the town's inhabitants come from all corners of the world, all the characters speak Spanish, French, Italian and English, all in various accents, which doesn't help either. Then, in the second half, the action kicks in, and we get what we paid for.The film has achieved an almost infallible reputation by now, and surprisingly, it's even in the IMDb top 100. With Clouzot at the helm, it's always worth watching, but I don't find it all that good and it didn't age very well. The main problem lies within the fact the film is constantly advertised as an action film, which it is, to a certain extent, but as far as action is concerned, the film is bound to disappoint. Perhaps it was something special in its day, but it's hardly a match for many similar films made during the '80s and '90s, that - for once - are in many ways much more effective.

This version is what the director intended us to show, since the version that was released commercially was shorter. We had seen the film years ago and frankly, we were more impressed then than now. Don't get us wrong, \"Le salaire de la peur\", Henri Georges Clouzot's has a lot to admire. The previous copy that we saw must have been the one that was cut for its American distribution. The film was deemed anti-American at the time it made its debut.Clouzot, like most of his contemporaries, had clear ideas about how they perceived American corporations overseas. Which is the case he makes with the oil company drilling in what appears to be Mexico, or a Central American country. Clouzot shows us a dusty town in the middle of nowhere where a group of mainly European expatriates, idle their time in the oppressing heat with nothing to do.It's into this milieu we come upon when the film opens. We are taken to the local cantina, where the men go to hang out. When Jo, a French man on the other side of the law arrives, he finds a fast friend in Mario, who appears to be the leader of the men we meet. Mario, who is much younger, yearns to go back to Paris. His wish is such that he has kept a ticket for the Metro to remind him of his beloved city.Jo, who has been friends with Bill, the American administrator, goes to see him to see about a job. What he proposes is something different, he needs four men, for two trucks that will bring badly needed nitroglycerin to a drilling site about 300 miles away. The road is treacherous and the drivers must bear in mind that any little thing will make their cargo explode and kill them.Mario is chosen to be in one truck with another man, who never shows up at the appointed time. Jo, appears instead. The other truck will have Luigi and Bimba. The four men don't realize the size of the task they must undergo and the dangers along the road.Clouzot's cut added the scenes in town in the cantina. Linda, the bar maid and the lover of the owner, is played by Vera Clouzot. The role appears to be superfluous since she doesn't add anything to what we are going to see, slowing the action. Once the men are on the road, a different movie emerges.The great Yves Montand plays Mario. It was his first starring role and he impresses with his virile looks and his no nonsense approach to his character. Charles Vanel, another excellent French actor makes the most out of his Jo. Jean Gabin, who was supposed to have played Jo, declined because he felt he didn't want to appear as a loser to his adoring fans; his loss was Charles Vanel's gain. Peter Van Eyck and Folco Lulli are seen as Bimba and Luigi, the second truck drivers.The transfer to the Criterion DVD has been done with extreme care because the film still has a great look.

Although I did not know the name of the film, it made such a favorable impression that I kept looking for it once I got back to the world; but it was never shown on American television. When William Friedkin made \"Sorcerer\" I was able to connect the dots and put a title to my elusive film. In many ways Henri-Georges Clouzot's film is a bridge between the Italian Neorealism of the early 1950's and the French New Wave of a few years later. Even more obvious is its link to early Hollywood Renaissance directors Arthur Penn, Sam Peckinpah, and Stanley Kubrick. Peckinpah pays homage to \"Wages of Fear\" with a similar introductory scene in \"The Wild Bunch\" and again in \"Straw Dogs\". Kubrick does it with \"The Blue Danube\" waltz in \"2001\", juxtaposing exterior shots of the moving space station with interior views of the stewardess serving a passenger (just as Clouzot cut between the truck cruising down the road and the party back in town). Penn was a little less obvious but the violent shifts between comedy and tragedy in \"Bonnie and Clyde\" can be traced back to a similar narrative technique in \"The Wages of Fear\".Most of the criticism about \"The Wages of Fear\" comes because Neorealism presents a more stylized reality than classic Hollywood narrative. The intent is to bring the ordinary features of the world into better focus by exaggeration. Expressionistically imitating reality while announcing that what is being shown is not real, the belief being that the more real the imitation the more fraudulent. Thus the use of narrative techniques that actually call attention to themselves. So the process of Jo (Charles Vanel) becoming a hero to Mario (Yves Montand) is shown through a montage of brief disjointed moments of connection. And Mario's journey from idolizing Jo to disillusionment and back to idolizing is much the same. Jo, Mario, Bimba (Peter van Eyck), and Luigi (Folco Lulli) are desperate men stranded somewhere in South America (probably Venezuela). They need money to escape so when an American oil company offers $4,000 to each pair of drivers willing to transport a ton of nitroglycerin (300 kilometers over poor roads) to a burning wellhead, they sign on for the job. Death could happen at any moment and the reactions of each man along the journey is compared and contrasted with what the viewer learned about them back in the village during the first half of the film. There is a certain foreshadowing as it is pointed out at the start that this is the kind of intense task where even the survivors will be permanently scarred emotionally. The four are not heroes, just a mixed group linked by a willingness to value themselves at only $2,000. The oil company (an American one) is able to operate in this remote region because there is plenty of manpower who share this mindset. The film is more anti- capitalist than anti-American and whatever political message it had in 1953 is more generic today. The cinematographer, Armand Thirard, keeps things claustrophobic throughout; in the dead- end town and in the cab of each truck. Clouzot sets up his most suspenseful sequence, where the trucks must back up on the unstable wooden platform in order to get around a hairpin bend, by having the first (smaller) truck narrowly succeed, heightening the tension as the bigger truck attempts the same maneuver. What establishes this as European art cinema is its willingness to break primary film conventions. Clouzot was free from the need for a happy ending and could let anything happen to his characters. Conventional narrative required that a character's narrow escape early in the film was because he had a purpose later in the story, but that is not the case with \"Wages of Fear\". You first realize the power this gives Clouzot when a stray rock rolls down a hillside toward a Jerry can filled with nitro. In this film such an ironic anticlimax is actually a real possibility. If you liked the original \"Flight of the Phoenix\" you will enjoy this film. And if you are a Peckinpah fan it is a must watch. Then again, what do I know?

It also has a strange, dark humoristic element which is fed mainly by the fact that all the main protagonists are far away from home and don't exactly know what they're doing.The location somewhere in a tropical or subtropical land is a dead end place. Europeans from different nations, all males, strand there and would like to go away as quickly as they can. They are a curious bunch of crooks of different ages and social stratas, no sense of friendship exists between them. And then, there are the Americans (called amerlocques, in true slang fashion). They work the local oil fields and are presented (in the European's comments, that is) as a greedy breed apart who will move on as soon as the resources are exhausted. They even have their own cemetery, comments the main character, all prefabricated! There are many of these quirky lines throughout the movie. The cross language style works very well in this movie, hearing the original sound certainly adds to the pleasure.The Europeans are hired by the Americans to transport highly explosive nitroglycerin to an uncontrollably burning oil well. They cannot resist doing this high risk job which might guarantee their return to Europe. One team consists of a German and an Italian. The second of two Frenchmen, and they, of course, are the main characters. Yves Montand and Charles Vanel make a great team. Especially Vanel is really brilliant. At first sight they are just the typical old gangster and young, admiring hood couple.

In the background a sculpturally shaped black woman takes an open air shower (full nudity in 1953, no less!). The woman stoops and starts screaming. A large, hairy spider moves tentatively over a white towel.

Vanel walks in front, checking for obstacles. His legs get entangled in a large branch already under tension from the truck's wheels. Montand does not dare stop the truck, Vanel submerges in the puddle, gets run over and comes up totally black. It is horrific but in a perverse way also comical. The truck gets stuck in the puddle, Montand drags Vanel out, then he has to take a dive himself to fix a cable.

Oh yes, it wasn't the Ray Harryhausen sea monsters of stop motion, nor was it aliens from outer space or Nosferatu or more sinister, the blonde Hitchcock Femme Fatale. No, it was much more real than that. Even a valuable lesson perhaps. Don't, and I repeat, don't carry Nitroglycerine around. You might get hurt. No film portrays being careful with dangerous substances quite so well as this film, because it give you the feeling that YOU are handling it. And that's the unsettling thing about it. Like James Coburn said in Sergio Leone's \"A Fistful Of Dynamite\", \"if this falls, you'd have to alter the maps\". Precisely so with the substance in question. Nitroglycerine. Who would be crazy enough to handle that. That's precisely what our film's protagonists may have thought had the pay not have been so big as to persuade them. On top of the unbearable, nail-biting, teddy bear clenching suspense, this film is one fantastic character study. Character revelations, weaknesses and heroics all come into play as the Nitro changes all their lives.It's South America. A remote village in the middle of God's nowhere. Outcasts, wanderers, desperadoes, fraudsters and nobodies from all around the globe work for peanuts in factories and mines, staying hopeful as to their unpredictable futures, for maybe one day they'd have enough money for a flight out to start a new life. Many await an opportunity for even a sign of work. But one thing's for sure - the desperation among the men make them very competitive. To the point where everybody is such a tough guy. Things change however when a very confident and tough French man named Jo comes to town. Mysterious but well dressed, he easily attracts the attention of a fellow French man named Mario. The two get along instantaneously, reaching a type of partner-hood that leads to neglect of the other men in town. Almost straight away, Jo is seen as a force not to be reckoned with. The tough guys of late are no more. People keep their mouths shut. He is established as a cutthroat with bad attitude, while Mario always keeping himself quiet. A wise man indeed. But among all men, human nature will always prevail.One morning the news comes out. In a remote oil mine far far away, miners have been killed in an explosion and a fire is consuming all the oil and environment around it. The fire must be stopped and the damage repaired. The mining company comes to the harrowing conclusion that Nitroglycerine is the only way at their disposal. There is only one problem. Who would be crazy enough to drive Nitro across some of the most difficult and death defying terrain through South American rain forest to the oil mine? Normally this would apply to everybody. But the job becomes like a one off chance to see Willy Wonka when the pay is announced. It comes as no surprise that every man jumps at the chance, life second to the smell of money.Following many tests, trials and errors, four men are selected to drive the two trucks. Mario is the most fit for the job. A German named Bimba and an Italian named Luigi drive in the other truck. Cheating was the only way Jo could drive with Mario as he was unqualified for the job. Then one night, the trucks are loaded with barrel upon barrel of Nitroglycerine. The trucks begin their suicide journey at snail pace through the streets of the town and into the murky hills of the rocky, muddy, slippery hills. For one slight bump could be the difference between life and death. A small disturbance in the substance would create such a powerful explosion as to rock the landscape miles in every direction. Are these men heroes or cowards? The tension breaks them as it breaks us, and we find out more about them as each bump raises the blood pressure in our veins. Clouzot's patient direction and masterful editing gives the film's title a whole new meaning. It's fantastic. But nothing beats the human study and the poignant message: Are men as tough as they appear? Although Clouzot didn't make as much of an impact on film as Alfred Hitchcock had and not nearly as many films, he was however a worthy competitor. With this film and Les Diabolique, Hitchcock's jealousy retaliated with the master works Vertigo and Psycho. Everything about this film is patient suspense. And nothing beats patient direction to make you feel uncomfortable - Something Hitchcock mastered long before. The power house actors namely Yves Montand as Mario brought the film to life. Charles Vanel as Jo had the most complex character and he molded him brilliantly. We feel sorry for him, we hate him, we like him and we identify with him. The actors absorbed their roles so well that by the end of the film, you feel as though you've been on a journey with these men, and rightfully so. Human emotion on the whole spectrum is showcased in great method, realistic performances. And the script was so well written - the dialog achieving a kind of audience disconnection that puts emphasis more on real conversation between actors. Very tense indeed.

Each has different fears and motivations for making the journey, and the director develops each one's personality from the start of the film through the drive itself.\"Wages of Fear\" is a very tense film in the second half as the two trucks make their way over treacherous roads, encountering obstacles along the way that require the men's creativity in overcoming.

Many of them are foreigners who want to flee the country but can not because they don't have the money. Getting a job is not an easy task and when one rises, few doubt the chance of taking it especially because it pays an extremely high sum of money. But the job is a risky one. It involves transporting a truck loaded with nitroglycerin, a dangerous explosive on the rough roads of the rural Brazilian land \u0096 the slightest concussion can result in tragedy. The nitroglycerin is needed to work as an explosive to suffocate some burning oil wells \u0096 although this detail is hardly necessary because this is a film about the suspense and fear on the journey, not the result. Four men get the job and two of each will drive the two tracks. There is Mario (Yves Montand), a french guy who has taken the job without the consent of his girlfriend. There is M. Jo (Charles Vanel), also a French who just arrived at the village, has become friends with his compatriot Mario, and has learned the bad economic situation that the people in the village face. The two will drive one of the tracks. Then there is Bimba (Peter van Eyck) and Luigi (Folco Lulli) who will drive the second track. It's clear that these men have been employed for the job not only because of there driving skills but also because they don't have insurance: if they die, nobody can denounce the employers for giving them a job that faces soo many risks.From this plot, french director H.G. Clouzot was able to create a taut, suspenseful, and often frightening film of the highest order whilst also revealing a human story beneath all the action. It is precisely the human story that is the film's most flawed element. The scenes before the men finally drive the tracks to there destinies are necessary to create an atmosphere and introduce that characters and indeed, it has some wonderful moments where we understand the characters and there motivations. But quite a bit of the film's first segment is unnecessary and doesn't really take us anywhere. It's not that I urgently wanted to get to the main action but I found a lot of the things that went on to be, well, futile. Moreover Linda (played by the director's wife Vera Clouzot) who is supposed to provide the film's love element is unsuccessfully developed: she is too much of a distraction, her performance far too melodramatic even for a rural girl with little education. We feel nothing but indifference when Mario abandons her and the later consequences.But putting aside these minor flaws that do not affect the overall impact of the story, The Wages of Fear is a brilliant film. The screenplay has more patience in revealing the suspense than most directors would: you always feel that the dangers the characters confront are not the result of the need to please the audience but a natural thing. Clouzot is clever in making the journey a realistic hell for the audience by rarely using music on the journey. We accompany the characters as they have to find there way through barriers of nature that are distressing, tense, and fearful. The conversations between the drivers reveal the depth of the personal wounds, the fears they have, the loneliness they suffer, the tragedies of there stories, and the despair in which they live. We see how dangerous situations reveal the true nature of people. At the beginning of the film, Jo is portrayed as this hard guy with authority but in the journey, we discover that it's really a facade intended to conceal his fearful and selfish self. Marion on the other hand is a man who acts more out of impulse than thought. Clouzot knew the attraction of putting two men with different ways of confronting danger and he wonderfully exploits it. Thus, the combination of the despair of the journey and the troubles of the characters creates a terrible atmosphere of intensity and unimaginable moments of self discovery. The conversations between Bimba and Luigi have less intensity in them but are still memorable.The ending is often condemned as ridiculous. It's despairing \"to watch a character die out of carelessness after spending the entire film watching him go through all that danger and survive.\" This view, like all opinions, is respectable but I think it looks at the film from the wrong angle. The ending ends not as a final climax but as a summing up of a theme dealt with through out. Mario survived because he had balls and nerves but not because of sane judgement. Had he had it, he would have expressed his fear like Jo, and even considered abandoning it but he didn't. Instead, he played with fate and you can only play with fate so much. Ironically it is fear that allowed him to deliver the nitroglycerin and survive its danger. But once he was the only survivor, once he suppressed the fear, he deemed himself as indestructible and resorted to carelessness which in the end lead him to his destruction. Perhaps Clouzot could have found a more subtle way to emphasize Mario's carelessness but in the end, this is an uncommonly involving motion picture.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 4}, "heading": "Masterful study in suspense despite flaws", "date": "2006-02-24T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1299630", "sentiment score": [0.0248, 0.2543, 0.5067, 0.2023, 0.0119]}, {"content": "In Clouzot, relationships are arenas of conflict: violent, callous, and often destined to sink into a whirlpool of deceit and destructive cruelty\u0085 Clouzot forms with \"The Wages of Fear\" two teams of four desperate European expatriates who agree to drive two trucks of nitroglycerine across miles of rocky mountain matched with craters to a site of an oil refinery fire so that the oil company can then blow the pipeline and put out the blaze...

Clouzot's directing is flawless - I don't think anyone has ever squeezed more tension with just a few essential scene elements. The trucks wheeze and grunt as well as they ever have in the movies - the only comparison is Spielberg's early gem, \"The Duel\", but Clouzot's automotive cinematics outdo even Spielberg. The stripped down existentialism of the characters, the starkness of their shared dilemma, the grim and grimy scenery, and the cinematography itself are all of a piece. The latter is what elevates this movie to the very top rank, including some of the most dramatic and effective black and white shooting I've ever seen. Yet it never becomes mannered or gratuitous - it is orchestrated with the rise - and rise! - of tension in the film. The final scene takes on a surreal as opposed to ultra-realistic quality that has its own logic. One last word about the acting - we don't see anything like it anymore. The self-conscious mannerism of method acting (which has had its own triumphs) and the toxic awareness of everyone from the actors to the audience, the camera, directors, etc. that each actor is a celebrity and potential artiste, has ruined that conviction that actors were once larger than life people before they went on-screen, that they came to acting as an outcome of living rough, unadorned, and yet imaginative lives as opposed to shooting for fame and fortune and celebrity within an artificial corporate star-making incubator.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 116, "votes": 143}, "heading": "One of the greatest movies ever made", "date": "2005-10-06T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1190062", "sentiment score": [0.0131, 0.0456, 0.1177, 0.4922, 0.3314]}, {"content": "In my opinion, Le Salaire de la peur is without a doubt one of the greatest suspense films ever made.

The film gives a commentary on the things that people will do for money, and it follows a treacherous journey across South America for two two-men teams of truckers transporting nitroglycerine across the continent for an American oil company, on the promise of $2000 when they reach their destination. The men taking this task on know very well what the risks are, but they decide to do it anyway just because they need the dough. Rather than just feeding us this premise, however, the great maestro has opted to make sure that we fully understand the situation that our protagonists are in. The first hour of the film just sees the main characters in their native village, scrimping and slowly killing themselves just to make enough money to live on. These guys have to drink lemonade when they go to their local drinking establishment, and this image of themselves is putting them on the back foot further still, as no one in the town will employ the people that they see as tramps. This back building gives the audience something that the main crux of the story wouldn't have otherwise; and that's understanding from the audience.Once the action starts properly, Clouzot really lets rips with his awesome directorial talent. Like he did with Les Diaboliques two years later; he really shows that he knows the meaning of suspense. The nitroglycerine loaded trucks in the movie could explode with the slightest vibration, and once again Clouzot makes sure that you understand the situation. The movie firmly balances itself on a short string, and any minute the leads could go up in flames; which gives the action a very potent degree of tension and suspense at all times, even when there isn't all that much going on. There are some very good stunts in the movie, however, and things such as the oil lake and the huge boulder in the middle of the road represent the best of them. The characters are both well introduced and well rounded, and Clouzot has given each of the four main men in the film their own distinctive character and because of the extensive situation building that the director gave us towards the start of the movie, we always care for them; which helps the movie no end when it comes to the more touching moments of the story.

Nineteen Fifty three was more or less around the apotheosis of Existentialism, And Clouzot hardly needed a bedside copy of Being and Nothingness for his handbook.

Once the story is reduced to two men each in two little sardine can truck cabs 'strapped' to nitroglycerine, you are glad you put up with some anti-imperialistic claptrap at the beginning. The director uses one standard shot, head-on of each truck crew through their windshields with alternating close ups of faces as they talk and we learn more about them and just when we have had enough 'getting to know you' some crisis erupts: an impassable turn, a boulder blocking the road, and finally the pool of oil.With what mastery Clouzot sets up that scene: the trucks do not travel in tandem but a mile or two apart. By the time Mario and Jo come upon the boulder-blocked road, the others have already conceived a plan to use a bit of their cargo to blast the rock away. The fuse is lit; the men scramble as suddenly they realize debris could hit their trucks and set off the nitro anyway. Rocks fall all about them but all is safe; they continue on their way, released and relieved. They smoke, and the German character begins to shave as the truck rumbles along, his truckmate marveling at his nerve as he explains how Nazi prisons made him the way he is. The director cuts to Mario and Jo, following and chatting, our eyes following their conversation through the windshield. A noise is heard and eyes bug out. A column of smoke on the road ahead. Their mates are gone, and in one of the most frightening scenes in film, Mario must pilot the truck through the oil left by their departure while Jo guides him.I recall Life Magazine, I believe, had a spread on this film when it came out with many photos.

The town is a dead-end rife with poverty and unemployment, its only industry being the Southern Oil Corporation (SOC) a Yankee enterprise. The residents are too demoralized to even consider escape to better climes. Like Mario explains to Jo in the course of a brilliantly spliced sequence of jump-cuts that covers the entire aspect of the town, \"It's like prison. Easy to get in, but escape is impossible.\"A major fire at the oil-wells calls for immediate shipment of explosive to isolate the blaze, but it's too late to bring in the specialized transportation. The company offers a payment of $2000 each for 4 locals who will carry the hazardous shipment in ordinary trucks. Mario, Jo, Luigi and a Jew Bimba take on the job, the promise of money to help them escape from the town sufficient even to temporarily offset the fear of death. Thus begins the arduous, tension-ridden journey that occupies most of this 148-min film. The trucks must move above a certain minimum speed to minimize vibrations (a ruse reused in 1994's Speed). On the way they face various blocks including a rickety wooden bridge the trucks must back up over. Mid-journey one of the trucks blows up. Mario and Jo who are in the other truck must overcome their horror at the catastrophe and cross further hurdles including a lake of oil created by the bursting of a pipeline.In the course of the journey we see a reversal in the roles of Jo and Mario. Initially Mario looks up to Jo, in awe of his cool and worldly-wise manner. But Jo is soon revealed to be in reality a scared old man for whom Mario has only a contemptuous pity. This character drama makes for engrossing viewing and in no small measure due to the excellent performances, especially Charles Vanel as Jo.The story moves smoothly thanks to very precise cutting, and some of the nighttime photography, as also the scene at the oil lake, is worth mentioning. Clouzot obviously has a sure hand over the bulk of the proceedings although he slips up in a couple of places: The oil company is portrayed in a rather ham-fisted (and badly acted) way as this evil uncaring monolith that would gladly blame dead employees for disasters to avoid compensation and resort to thoroughly unethical means to get its job done. Most of the supporting characters are cardboard. Also, some of the miniature work is painfully obvious, although that'd be likely a limitation of technical facilities available to the crew. The ending of the film is finely executed but seems all too contrived to give you your daily dose of irony.In the end, this remains a taut and finger-licking good old-school thriller, which bothers to provide characters interesting enough for us to care about their life and death.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 19, "votes": 25}, "heading": "Excellent human thriller", "date": "2004-10-03T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0941208", "sentiment score": [0.0299, 0.1593, 0.4126, 0.3592, 0.0389]}, {"content": "Nail destroying tension, a fine cast and super sour direction make this 50s French thriller an unmissable classic An extraordinarily gripping thriller from Henri-Georges Clouzot that establishes and maintains a level of tension rarely equalled elsewhere in cinema.

Clouzot's style is gritty and realistic, with cuts between the trucks and close-ups of their actions (hands on the shift lever, feet on the pedals, etc) serving to heighten the tension.

In a steamy, impoverished Latin American town called Las Piedras, insects grope clumsily in the dust, struggling to escape the strings that children have tied to them. People from all over the world congregate in the streets and bars and the air is thick with choking dust. Clouzot makes clear the desperation of the residents, \"It's like prison,\" explains one of them. \"Easy to get in, but escape is impossible.\" The Southern Oil Company (SOC - same initials as Standard Oil) runs the town and enjoys its profits while the villagers are compelled to work odd jobs just to stay alive. After a fire breaks out at one of the oil fields killing many workers, the anti-union American boss seeks experienced drivers from among the townspeople to put out the fire. It is here that the anti-American flavor runs thick and where much of this part of the film was originally excised for American audiences (but has since been restored). Four men, desperate to escape their trap, agree to drive a truck loaded with nitroglycerine 300 miles over treacherous mountain roads in the hot sun for the sum of $2000 each. Transporting the nitroglycerine for them is a way out of hopelessness -- either through a big paycheck or through sudden death, with the latter appearing the more probable. Though sadly past the point in time when we can still be shocked over gangster capitalism and men selling out for money, the story is nonetheless compelling. The four who are chosen to go on this fool's errand include Mario, a young Corsican played by Yves Montand in a role that brought him widespread attention. He is carrying on an affair with a local servant girl, Linda (Vera Clouzot) who is in love with him. His treatment of her, however, is atrocious and reflects the attitude of the male-dominated society they live in. Also picked to drive one of the trucks is Jo, an aging Parisian small-time crook (Charles Vanel), Luigi (Folco Lulli), an Italian with less than a year to live, and an ex-nazi pilot (Peter van Eyck). This unlikely group will play a cat-and-mouse game with death for the remainder of the film.Clouzot depicts several incidents that bring the tension to the boiling point. In the first one, the trucks must travel at least 40 mph over a pot-holed stretch of road to prevent the vibrations from setting off the nitroglycerine. The second involves a sharp, narrow turn that requires the trucks to back up onto an unstable, rotten wooden platform causing it to buckle. Almost immediately afterwards, the trucks are stopped by a huge boulder in the middle of the road and must siphon off some of the nitroglycerine to blow it up. Finally, Mario must deftly maneuver the truck over a depression of spilled oil with the wheels stuck in reverse. As the long treacherous journey unfolds, roles are reversed between Mario and Jo as Mario becomes the strong dominant one and Jo, in Charles Vanel's brilliant performance, becomes shaken, fearful, and docile. Their relationship becomes the highlight of the film as the two become mutually dependent on each other for survival and comfort. I found Wages of Fear to be an involving experience that kept me riveted throughout, though I did sense that there would not be a two and a half-hour film unless somebody survived. Although the unexpected plot twists were gripping, the best part of the film for me was the revelation of each character when faced with fear. It reminded me of the \"Treasure of the Sierra Madre\", a film that also showed men discovering the truth about themselves and others while pursuing their dream of wealth. Wages of Fear lived up to its accolades, but for me the discordant ending clashed both with the tone of the film and with my experience of the universe not as arbitrary or capricious but as filled with meaning and purpose.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 44, "votes": 59}, "heading": "Riveting and Involving", "date": "2002-11-04T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0050231", "sentiment score": [0.0207, 0.1093, 0.3828, 0.4308, 0.0564]}, {"content": "Contains Spoilers Now I know I'm supposed to kiss the ass of director Henri-Georges Clouzot and say this is the most exciting movie ever filmed, and has the best character studies ever written, but I don't feel like it. Now don't get me wrong, it really is a good movie that is hugely suspenseful with great acting and a real good story, but some of the stuff that has been written about it makes me laugh.The plot is about a bunch of out of work European and American expatriates that are more or less stranded in a South American town because they have no money to get out. An oil well about 300 kilometers away has an oil rig go up in flames and the only way to put it out is with a blast of nitroglycerin. The nearest nitro is in the town where our out of work expat's are. It is a suicide mission that the oil company is willing to pay $2000 per man as long as a truck's cargo reaches the oil rig intact. The workers union won't allow any of their workers to embark on so dangerous a task so the local oil rig manager has to recruit four volunteers to drive two trucks without shocks on a bumpy road carrying 100 pounds of nitro each.There are many more volunteers than there are positions so the oil rig manager takes them out to test their driving ability. Four men are picked but one who was left out is a local tough guy called Jo who is wonderfully played by Charles Vanel. He gets the forman to agree that he will be the back up if any of the four men picked don't make the 3 am starting time the following morning. That night Jo takes one of the drivers home and low and behold, that guy doesn't make the 3 am deadline the next morning!This is a somewhat long movie at 148 minutes and at about 1 hour into it the drive with the nitro starts. They crawl along at first, slowly building their speed and their courage. But as it turns out, Jo is not the tough old man he thought he was. The other man in his truck is his friend who he recently met in this forsaken town, Mario (Yves Montand). As Jo breaks down Mario has to take over and is determined to survive the journey and collect his money so he can get out of the town with his sweetheart, Miss L\u00e9gitimus (Darling L\u00e9gitimus, who is also director Henri-Georges Clouzot's wife). The other two men in the other truck were sent a half hour after the first truck as a precaution but with Jo's stalling and slow driving they quickly catch up and pass the first truck. They run into obstacles along the way and a lengthy scene were they have to back onto a partially built wooden bridge is extremely nerve racking. I won't give any more away but the end of the movie is simply not one that would have happened if this film would have been made in Hollywood. In fact there was a remake, 1977s Sorcerer. A goofy title but the remake is actually a good movie, directed by William Friedkin and starring Roy Scheider.The dvd itself for Wages of Fear, part of the Criterion Collection, is a great looking transfer (for a 50 year old movie) but there are no extras at all on the disk, not even a trailer. There are several minutes of footage on this cut that were deleted in the original US theatrical release, not for lewdness or graphic violence, but for making a fictional US oil company look like an uncaring and greedy company. Imagine that.If you could buy just one French new wave film with subtitles, this one would certainly be a good choice. But since you are obsessed with this buying dvd's thing like I am, you can buy as many as you can afford. This retails for $30 which is a little on the high side, especially considering the no extras, but if you can get it in the $20 range I would consider adding it to your collection like I did.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 6}, "heading": "Good movie that is hugely suspenseful with great acting", "date": "2002-10-23T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0050230", "sentiment score": [0.021, 0.23, 0.6039, 0.1373, 0.0078]}, {"content": "i used to think there was a hidden book /movie/ song that I had never read/ seen/ heard that was fantastic and I would never be the same again - -well that's not true BUT if there was one it would be this movie-- yeah the remake is OK (sorcerer) but the original is the best non English film since the Jazz Singer - and perhaps the best suspense picture till Hitchcock hit form.

From the opening scene showing the squalor of a Latin American town with filth and vultures in the street and naked children begging for food amid the oppressive, fly-stirred heat, to the finale on a winding mountain road, it is just plain fascinating. True, some of the action does not bear close scrutiny. One does not siphon nitroclycerine nor does one avoid potholes or bumps in the road by driving at forty miles per hour. No matter. Let's allow a little license. And the title doesn't entirely make sense because the wages of sin are death, but the wages of those who followed their fear and did not seek to drive a nitroclycerine truck over 300 miles of bad road are life. Again, no matter.This is such an original movie, every scene like little or nothing you've ever seen before (and for sure will never see again), that the little inconsistencies and some stretching of what is possible are not important. This is man against nature, man against himself reduced to a simple task. It is life in the raw. One mistake and you are dead.Yves Montand has the lead as Mario, a Frenchman stranded in this god-forsaken town with only one way out: get enough money to pay for airfare. Charles Vanel is the older, tin-horn dandy who ends up with a case of the shakes. Peter Van Eyck is the man with the nerves of steel who finds this little adventure a piece of cake after forced labor in the salt mines for the Nazis. And Folco Lulli is Luigi, the happy, singing baker who hopes to return to Italy with the two thousand dollars they are paying him to drive the nitro-loaded truck.This is a film depicting the primitive nature of a macho mentality. There's a lot of posturing. Every event is a potential test of manhood. Status and privilege are flouted. The weak and the poor do not inherit the earth.Henri-Georges Clouzet directs and somehow manages to come up with a work of genius. One wonders how. The story, on the face of it, would seem to belong in the slush pile of a ten-cent pulp fiction mag from the 1930's. The acting is good, very good in places, but not great. The cinematography is straightforward, but nonetheless very effective. It is lean and focused always, showing us what needs to be seen without drawing attention to itself: the invisible style, which is the best. Clouzet's direction is characterized by a vivid depiction of things that we can feel: the mud and filth in the streets, the desperation and the boredom, the cruelty and meanness of men, the oil on their bodies, the singular fact of a ton of nitro in the back seat so that every move is a neuron-exposing adventure. I think that the visceral experience from beginning to end and the fine pacing are the essence of what makes this a great film.Clouzet's wife, Vera Clouzet, plays Linda who first appears scrubbing the floor in an open-air bistro. She is rather extraordinary herself, finely made up and creamy white like a star of the silent film era. She grovels a lot, especially for Mario. She provides the counter-point, the contrast for the testosterone action of the movie.No student of film should miss this. It would be like missing Citizen Kane or Dr. Strangelove or especially The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, which it vaguely and strangely resembles. \"La salaire de la peur\" is, regardless of its flaws, one of the best ever made.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 130, "votes": 176}, "heading": "Macho naturalism extraordinaire", "date": "2002-05-07T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0050220", "sentiment score": [0.0078, 0.0225, 0.0718, 0.4906, 0.4073]}, {"content": "This is richer, tenser, more atmospheric, and in all ways a better film than Clouzot's next one, \"Les Diabolique\" - which is saying a lot. I've never understood why Clouzot isn't more highly regarded. Indeed, for a long time I simply couldn't believe that he wasn't.One charge that hangs over his head is misogyny. With regards to \"Les Diabolique\" this is simply ridiculous; with regards to \"The Wages of Fear\", I can see how one could harbour the uncomfortable feeling that there is, perhaps, something in it. But what, really, does the evidence amount to? The fact that one of the heroes is inexcusably cruel to his girlfriend? It's not as if the film endorses this, or invites us to take pleasure in it, or even, for that matter, allows us to. The characters are all flawed, and the film doesn't seek to deny it. It does, however, make an attempt to explain it. That town in the middle of nowhere is, we feel, really in the MIDDLE of nowhere; it must be the dustiest and most demoralising place on Earth. After a while we feel as if we could start kicking someone, just to break the monotony.There's no doubt that the initial monotony gives the rest of the film half its strength. William Wyler once said that if you want to surprise or shock an audience the best thing you can do is bore them half to death beforehand - and although I can think of absolutely no reason why this should be so, allowing for a little exaggeration, it's true. The seemingly aimless opening sequences help make every single frame, from the moment the nitro-glycerin is mentioned, electric.So much is, in retrospect, amazing. There's the way Clouzot manages to show us the humanity in these seemingly squalid people. (Even the oil magnate, just when we think he's the world's most heartless capitalist, reveals he has a heart with an unexpected remark, and yet the remark doesn't feel at all out of character - it's the kind of masterful characterisation film-goers live for.)

The first is some of the logic is screwy; the second is the oilman O'Brien is not a character, he's a grotesque anti-American caricature, in sharp contrast to the beautifully limned characterizations of the protagonists. Neither of these flaws make a whit of difference in my reaction to this film. THE WAGES OF FEAR is all the things others have claimed: an action-packed suspense classic with a strong existential flavor. But, first and foremost, it is a masterful MOVIE. When you watch WAGES as an example of storytelling on film, there isn't a wasted second or a wrong step. The 'slow' first half in the hot little village is never less than exhilirating...you can smell the stale, moist air and taste the salt of your own sweat after an hour of Clouzot's detailed, swooning-from-the-humidity immersion of the audience into this hellish purgatory: by the time O'Brien is looking for drivers, you know exactly why these men are so desperate to risk death to get out. (One man, denied the job, commits suicide; another, who did get the job, may have been murdered by one of our 'heroes'.)The long, long journey they must travel to get their $2000 is unforgettable: every emotion, every frayed nerve-end is exposed during the ordeal. We see these men at their most elemental and vicious and cowardly...but we also see their incredible nobility and love later - when they have gone so far beyond turning back that their hope, their dignity and courage are the only things they have left to combat their fear and despair. Even though none of these things matter when a hard bump on the road will immolate saint and sinner alike, they become the only things that matter; it's a beautiful, timeless message for a film to contain. Those moments in WAGES where we see the men at their best (the scene where Luigi is discovered alive after the blast, Montand's comforting the dying Vanel at journey's end) are even more indelible and affecting than the noirish scenes of the men falling apart from stress - and THOSE are considerably powerful. Remade for no earthly reason I can discern, and another example of how superior French films before the Nouvelle Vague were to those that followed.

I have no problems with the symbolic images & acts that open & close the film: the cockroach \"dance\" & Mario's last drive.

It bridges the gap between the pre war films and films of the French New Wave. The story is excellently done and the scenes during the middle part of the film is shown with hand trembling suspense. The Wages of Fear(1953) as with Jean Pierre Melville's Bob Le Flambeur(1954) and Jules Dassin's Rififi(1955) are a few fine examples of some great Film Noir pictures to come out of France during the 1950s.\nThe Wages of Fear(1953) introduced a new and exciting actor by the name of Yves Montand. This is the motion picture that made him an international star and would make him into one of French cinema's best leading actors. He does an outstanding job in projecting macho qualities as well as qualities of concern in the role of Mario. The most interesting scenes are the ones with him and fellow actor Charles Vanel.\nThe direction of the movie is done with total perfection. Henri Georges Clouzot does a terrific job in handling the suspense scenes. He also does a good job in setting those scenes up. From watching this film I come to know that I am watching the work of an artist.\nI love the cinematography of The Wages of Fear(1953). The cinematography is helped out by some smooth editing on part of the people who made this film. The camera work increases the suspense and triples the tension that is felt between the main characters. The cinematography glides like an angel and flows like clouds.\nThe main villains in the movie are the Oil company that employs the four main characters. The scenes with the Oil Company was cut when first released here because because of its negative portrayal of the American oil company. These scenes have been since restored on DVD. I can see why these scenes where cut because they give the film an anti-American flavor.\nIts a great film because it has all that is important to cinema work well. The relationship between Mario and Jo is very similar with the relationship of the two women in Les Diaboliques(1955). Henri Georges Clouzot was known then as The French Hitchcock and for good reason. It has a very sad surprise ending with some good music.\nLe Salaire de la Peur(1953) along with Les Diaboliques(1955) are unfortuately only a handful of film that the director is known for.

This heightens the suspense while recalling Hemingway's early short stories, in which a man survives the nihilistic world around him by focusing on the details of work. Clouzot suggests tensions among the characters, then expands on them, and we watch them change under pressure - the pressure of the perilous task they face, and the pressure they exert on each other - not unlike his film Les Diaboliques.

The owner of an American-based fuel company offers the men $2 000 to transport 2 truckloads of nitroglycerin over a 300 treacherous-mountainous miles.

Director Henri-Georges Clouzot adapted the screenplay from a novel by Georges Arnaud, creating a totally realistic world full of poverty and despair. The people living in this wretched part of the world aren't fazed, however, as their spirits remain strong. The principal's efforts to rise above it all, though heroic, prove ultimately fatal. Clouzot creates a couple of tremendously unforgettable scenes: the men pushing their trucks over dilapidated bridges, across mountains, broken down roads, and an oil well. Like no other film since we feel the desperation and dismay the characters go through.

The beginning paints a picture of a world unimaginable to anyone from a developed country, of corruption, poverty, and oppression. It simultaneously describes the main characters - a bunch of immigrants who have strayed to this miserable little town, and for whom there is little chance of escape from the baking heat and unemployment. There is Mario, the happy-go-lucky scrounger, Luigi, his hard-working Italian pal, the comically tyranical tavern owner, his much abused maid, and Jo, the suave and dangerous French gangster. Homosexuality, racism, and the oppression of women figure prominently, but are never commented upon directly, as various prison motifs are evident in the lighting and set construction. Suddnly there is a change - a way out for a 'lucky' four of the deadbeats. There has been an explosion at an oil well on the other side of the mountain. The oil company needs to put out the fire with explosives, which are stored in the town. But its nitro-glycerine, and there is no time to get specially-fitted trucks to carry it over the rough mountains roads. Rather than risk their own employees, the oil company offers a large reward to four volunteers. Cue the action as first the men compete for the places on the two trucks, then as the winners embark on their terrifying journey, where every bump could spell instant death. On the journey their true characters emerge. One, Jo, is broken by the ordeal, but is eventually redeemed. 'How exciting could a simple road trip be?' you might ask, but the one and a half hour screen journey is petrifyingly spellbinding. Fate seems to be stacked against these bedraggled heroes, but it is their ingenuity, effort and bravery which captures our hearts.
