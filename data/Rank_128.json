The story follows a little boy who befriends a tramp (played by Chaplin) and together they embark on a journey filled with adventure, heartbreak, and laughter.Chaplin's signature physical comedy is on full display here, but what really sets this movie apart is the underlying emotional depth. The Kid explores themes of poverty, abandonment, and the search for belonging, all through the eyes of a child. It's a touching and bittersweet story that will leave you feeling both uplifted and melancholy.Despite being almost 100 years old, The Kid's charm and relevance haven't faded. It's a testament to Chaplin's genius that his films continue to resonate with audiences across generations.If you're a fan of classic cinema, The Kid is an absolute must-watch. And if you're not, it's still worth checking out for its universal themes and timeless humor.Fun fact: The Kid was Chaplin's first feature-length film and was a massive commercial success upon its release, grossing over $2.5 million (equivalent to over $40 million today).", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "The Kid: A Timeless Tale of Redemption and Regret", "date": "2023-05-07T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9039444"}, {"content": "You just never know who you might cross paths with.One day while the Tramp (Charlie Chaplin) is out for a stroll, he stumbles upon the soon-to-become love of his life -- a baby abandoned in the street.I'd seen this wonderful film years ago but had an opportunity to return to it at a public screening here in NYC, featuring live accompaniment by the master guitarist Yasmin Williams.Though the flapper-era silent suffers a bit from repetitiousness, it has held up well across the decades, and upon reviewing, it remains funny and deeply moving.We believe the bonding between the Tramp and the Kid (Jackie Coogan), as well as the touching reunion of the boy and his grieving mom (Edna Purviance), \"whose sin was motherhood.\"The movie takes us from \"Alone.\" to \"Fate.\" to a satisfying if old-fashioned, happy ending.

Much has been gained over the years since talkies first premiered, but what has been lost? With screen legend Charlie Chaplin here serving as writer, director, star, producer, editor, and even composer, this feature is a baby all his own, and he demonstrates his utmost skill in every capacity. It's one matter to read of how well a picture is regarded; it's another to experience it for oneself. One hundred years of praise do not lie: 'The kid' is outstanding.The movie is phenomenally well balanced, with every ponderous story beat pairing with delightful comedy. At times heartfelt or more often sorrowful, but always sincere, the instances of weighty human drama are weirdly but impeccably complemented with marvelous physical comedy, sight gags, or situational humor. While the supporting cast is quite adept themselves, of course the exquisite conglomeration owes almost everything to Chaplin's genius. Yet how can one even begin to succinctly describe it? The icon's narrative and scene writing are both utterly stupendous - rich, earnest, enchanting, smart, and irrepressibly joyful. As director Chaplin illustrates a sharp eye for orchestrating shots and scenes, and guiding his cast, such that even as some footage is sped up for comedic effect, every passing moment is played off with believable, natural ease and gracefulness. His work as editor is both precise and fluid, bolstering the quality of the film at large. And, why, even the consideration of aspects like costume design, hair and makeup, or set design and decoration are fabulous.Meanwhile, though much has been made of Chaplin's gifts for non-verbal expression, and physicality, his co-stars are no slouches. Jackie Coogan, a mere boy as he gets the spotlight as the title character, exhibits intelligence and range beyond his meager few years in a performance that matches the comedic master toe to toe. Edna Purviance and Carl Miller fill roles that are as much archetype as plot necessity as \"the woman\" and \"the man,\" but they both bring gratifying heart to the title that serves as a superb foil to the cheekier levity, and a strong source of the sobriety. Chaplin's score, meanwhile, comes across always as sweet, piognant, and wistful, and itself rahter stands out in an era of cinema where music was often secondary. And - and! - as if all this weren't enough, 'The kid' is so fantastically clever and vibrant that the slightest of details or flourishes inspire - such the way The Tramp gets out of bed for the day, or how an emotionally wrought conversation between The Man and The Woman is ever so keenly encapsulated within a single cutaway shot.Actors and characters we see for only a single scene are given an opportunity to shine. Swell as the camerawork and arrangement of scenes are generally, some examples of shot composition herein are exceptional. And as if all this weren't enough, R. H. Totheroh's cinematography is so crisp and vivid - and the movie has been so incredibly well preserved, all this time later - that the production values almost seem like they're decades ahead of their times. The inescapable genius of 'The kid' cannot be overstated - this is a tremendous, satisfying, fulfilling, and outright quintessential slice of cinema that holds up with 99.99% flawlessness an entire century later. (The only possible point of critique - though characteristic of the era - is a passing instance of blackface. Sigh.)In every way that matters most, this movie is actually, genuinely perfect. Still further dissection would be all too easy, for every last scrap of the feature is put together with dazzling, careful passion and integrity. Yet further discussion would surely begin to betray plot points - and one hardly wishes to spoil the experience for another. Ultimately all I can say is that this is an absolute must-see, and if you have to go out of your way to watch it, then do it. 'The kid' is almost certainly one of the greatest films that has ever been made, and you're missing out terribly if you don't see it at least once.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "A truly essential, must-see cinematic classic", "date": "2022-06-21T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8258498"}, {"content": "I've never watched a Charlie Chaplin film all the way through before. Sure I've seen the clips, but watching in entirety is another thing. The Kid, not only written, directed and produced by Chaplin, was scored too. This is no minor thing, score is always important but more so when the film is otherwise silent. A young woman, left alone with an unwanted child. Does what she thinks is best, leaving him in a fancy car in an affluent area, only for the car to be pinched by two robbers, who then leave him out on the street. It's dramatic stuff. Thank god for Charlie who instantly lightens the mood as The Tramp. There's little need to describe him of course, he's iconic. The look, the walk. Watching him for a full feature though, you see just how well rounded a character he is, right from the get go. He finds himself at first comically landed with the kid, until he discovers he's orphaned when he melts and becomes possibly the worlds least prepared father. The storytelling is light, but full of heart and really zips along at quite a lick. Everything's very economical, there's not a wasted shot. The Tramp is an inventive sort, raising the boy to not only help make ends meet, but also be great on screen. Child actor Jackie Coogan really is a delight, but doesn't steal Chaplin's thunder. It's hysterical fun as the pair get into scraps in the slums, but when the boy gets sick the pesky authorities try to intervene to take him to the 'orphanage asylum', now that doesn't sound good does it. Chaplin is of course fantastic, but really the whole case are excellent. Portraying real joy and despair with the actions. There's some wonderful sequences too, even a rooftop chase, a brawl in a moving car and a trippy dream sequence. It's blockbuster stuff.

I'm talking naturally about 1921's \"The kid\", Charlie's first full-length picture that he was working on for almost a year.The movie tells a story of a single mother who abandons her child; this decision is not easy to make but she decides on what's best for her son, she wants a better future than the one she can offer right now so she leaves him on the street. The child is being picked up by the little Tramp and he is uncertain in the beginning about joining this life of a father he never asked for - he barely can make both end meet for himself let alone another human being but he accepts the kid and shares with him everything that he's got; it's not a lot but it's the only right thing to do for the Tramp: a difficult life is better when shared with someone.The movie touches me on so many levels - the way Charlie tells a story, the way the music suits perfectly with the motion picture, the way Edna's the mother changes in her face when she realizes what she has done, the way little child is hugging the closest person he ever had and, of course, Charlie himself. This is his first full-fledged drama inspired partially by his own traumatic experience from the failed first marriage and the loss of his barely born son; when he finished the movie his ex-wife wanted to take \"The kid\" with her as compensation but Chaplin didn't let that happen, hid the movie and secretly edited it the way he wanted it.The movie raises awareness of poverty, forsaken orphans, broken hearts, bad decisions, injustices, but also kindness, selflessness, a desire to help no matter what, love for your closed ones and this is only the top of the iceberg. The genius of Charlie Chaplin taught us to give our whole hearts to the ones we love and never let go of them.

I kind of agree with this choice, the plot should be more focused on the relationship between the father and son; the mother is more of a side character. The movie was also given a new score. This is one of the earliest examples of a \"director's cut\" before that was even a widely accepted thing. It's pretty short at about 53 minutes long (about fifteen minutes shorter than the original cut), so it doesn't drag at all.Charlie Chaplin was the master of silent film. No other silent actor, in my opinion, comes close to evoking as much charm and charisma. Maybe Buster Keaton.Anyways, the story is quite simple, but it works as a very early motion picture. The mother has to abandon her child early on, and Chaplin's famous \"Tramp\" character ends up finding the kid. He becomes an adoptive father, and many of the sequences involve the bonding of the father and son and their relationship.The only real letdown is the weird dream sequence at the end of the film. It's bizarre and out of place. It's a nice spectacle and showcase of stunts and editing, but it doesn't really fit in with the rest of the movie. I said earlier too, the plot is very simple, and Chaplin would outdo himself with later pictures.It's still a must-watch as a showcase of Chaplin's acting chops.

He embarked on an ambitious undertaking where he looked to transform comedic pictures with a blend of farce and pathos. Maybe it was the recent dissolution of his short-lived marriage, or the loss of his three-day old infant, or a nostalgia attack of his own parentless childhood. Whatever the reason, his written and directed January 1921's \"The Kid\" established a new category in cinema: a comedy with a twist of poignancy. Chaplin prefaces his first feature with the title card 'A picture with a smile--and perhaps, a tear' to prepare his viewers this was not going to be a normal knockabout comedy.Chaplin's co-star in \"The Kid\" was Jackie Coogan, 5, who plays Chaplin's 'adopted' son. The young Jackie passed his initial audition on the big screen with the famous comedian in his \"A Day's Pleasure;\" in his latest movie he receives co-star billing as an abandoned boy discovered by The Tramp as a baby and brought up his poverty-ridden abode. Things get sticky when the boy's mother, unbeknownst to her, crosses paths with the two, setting off a series of pursuits between the authorities and the unwitting Tramp.Chaplin and the young Jackie had a special bond off-camera as well when the actor took the boy to amusement parks every Sunday during the first weeks of filming. The production, an unusually long five and one half month stretch, upset the executives of First National who wanted to capitalize on their prized star more timely releases. But once they were escorted on a personal studio tour by Chaplin to see the process of \"The Kid,\" they understood his schedule. Their patience was rewarded when the feature turned out to be the second highest box office success of the year.Members of The American Film Institute especially loved \"The Kid,\" nominating it as one of 400 of the organization's Top 100 Greatest American Movies as well as one of 500 films nominated for its list of 100 Funniest American Movies.One of \"The Kid's\" most dramatic scenes is when Jackie is placed in a wagon to be carted off to an workhouse after being taken away from The Tramp. He's shown dramatically appealing to the authorities. To elicit the Jackie's enormous trauma, the senior Coogan, who played several characters in the movie and was his son's overseer during the production, threatened to take Jackie to a real workhouse if he didn't emote streams of tears. As witnessed in the movie, the ploy worked.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Chaplin's First Feature Film", "date": "2021-10-12T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7436498"}, {"content": "This is one of the first movies of Charlie Chaplin.

That makes this film 100 years old! A century has gone by since it was made, released, and first viewed, and yet it's still available to be appreciated anew today. The DVD print that I watched was in very good shape, the picture was great, and I felt that I was watching an important piece of cinema history.However, \"The Kid\" is by no means one of my favorite Chaplin films. In fact, two out of my top three aren't even silent films, but prime examples of Chaplin's later work: \"Monsieur Verdoux\" (1947) and \"Limelight\" (1952). And my third favorite, the 1936 masterpiece \"Modern Times\", is only two-thirds silent!The plot of the film is quite simple: our beloved Little Tramp finds another little tramp, and and raises the foundling as his own. Years pass, and together, they rise above their life of poverty through the power of love and comedy.\"Professionally funny\" is a phrase that I thought a fitting description of Chaplin. He was an artistic genius, and he knew what he was doing and how to engage an audience. In fact, this was his first feature-length film, and he took a whopping five-and-a-half months to shoot it, which was an incredible amount of time for a film production in 1921. Chaplin, of course, not only starred, but wrote, directed, produced, and scored the film!Jackie Coogan was fantastic as \"the Kid\", displaying a wide range of emotion and deftly tugging at the viewer's heartstrings. His father, Jack Coogan, Sr., coached his son during filming and was paid $125 a week by Chaplin, and also played several small parts within the movie.It is said that Chaplin and Coogan were as close off-screen as on, and every Sunday during the first few weeks of filming, Chaplin would take the boy to the amusement park or other fun activities. This relationship was seen as either an attempt on Chaplin's part to reclaim his own unhappy childhood, or possibly he was just thinking about his own son whom he had lost, having died three days after birth.\"The Kid\" features a truly bizarre dream sequence in which the Tramp falls asleep on his doorstep and dreams of everyone - including himself - as an angel or demon.He envisions himself as an angel, with white, feathery wings spread out behind him, and a harp in his hand. Others, including a neighborhood bully, appear as demons, depicted traditionally in dark (presumably red) attire and horns atop their heads. Even a little dog, suspended on wires, comes floating by in a little angel costume!It's one of the strangest and most inexplicable dream sequences I've seen in a film, and yet it is oddly captivating.The technical aspects in this film - both in the dream sequence and in the rest of the movie - are marvelous when one considers that it was made a hundred years ago, when the movie medium itself was less than thirty years old.Whether or not it is one of Chaplin's greatest works is up to the individual viewer, but you cannot deny that it is a landmark movie, and holds an important place in the history of American cinema. It deserves a look, maybe even more than one.

A Classic Silent Feature with a historic combination of Smile and Tear. The Kid will always remain one of the most important picture in cinema history for many reasons. One of them is, this is where the Legacy of Charles Chaplin begun. The other one is, this is where the best use of child character was done for the first time. And one of the best reason is, Chaplin showed us a picture with a significant combination of Smile and Tear. Finally, cinema moved from just being a Melodrama or Emotional Drama of DW Griffith style to Comedy-Melodrama or Emotional-Comedy drama of modern art. There have been many remakes and adaptions of The Kid and but this film remains The Daddy of all and will remain untill the earth vanishes. The Kid is a simple story based on human relations and bonding being strong beyond the barriers of blood relations. The Tramp cares for an abandoned child, they share an unbreakable bond but some events put that relationship in jeopardy. I don't actually know what to talk about this film, i mean i have been seeing this film since i was a kid and i am sure you all have been through the same so basically it's just difficult to put that entire nostalgia in words from a reviewer's mindset. I mean this film is above that, it is just not a film, it's a human culture we follow. It's our lesson on human relations and their bonding. And such stuff can't be described in Cinematic words even if we call ourselves big movie buffs, cinephiles and what not. The Kid just holds your heart and never loses the grip over it hence it never gives a chance to your mind to get involved in the viewing. The heart sees something which is simply touching and moving and that's all. What to say more?

The only thing that kept me from giving it five stars is the \"dream sequence\" that I considered to be superfluous. This silent film is now over 90 years old.

In addition to acting and directing, it is also likely that he wrote the musical score (as he did for many of his films). Jackie Coogan's performance is also remarkable. Chaplin really did have a great amount of affection for Coogan, and remembered him for the rest of his life. Edna Purviance was not able to make a success of her career after Chaplin, but he kept her on his payroll for the remainder of her life. Lita Grey, Chaplin's second wife and the mother of his two oldest sons Charles Jr. and Sydney, has a very brief appearance in the \"dream sequence\".

I often question if that's even possible, I'm unsure if certain films could be understandable just by watching pantomime. Could films like 12 Angry Men, A Few Good Men, or Locke be just as great by using physical movement as much as it is by its sharply written dialogue?While silent films have mainly become a delicacy for aficionados nowadays, they were actually quite popular in their day, and none were more so than Chaplin. As a child, I was quite taken with Chaplin's physical comedy and would watch many clips of his best moments on the internet. I would even mimic his famous Tramp walk even up into my teenaged years, but I didn't realize just how thoughtful, emotional, and even profound that he could be until I was older, and no where it this more clear than with The Kid, my favorite of his films and my favorite silent film.I often like to say that Chaplin is the Charles Dickens of cinema, and it's true in more ways than one. Both were working class chaps who rose through the ranks in order to become some of the most beloved talents of their day, both had a keep social awareness and wit that keeps their works alive in the modern age, and both knew how to entertain their audiences while also not being afraid to be intelligent and thoughtful. Though the irony isn't lost in the fact that Dickens predominately used words to express the way that he viewed the world, while Chaplin used pantomime as well as the visual medium of filmmaking to express his.The Kid is a rather straight-forward story, with Chaplin's famous character The Tramp taking on a young apprentice, and with that we get a deeply felt, heart warming story about an odd duo attempting to make their way in the world, and a strong bond and chemistry between Chaplin and co-star Jackie Coogan which would birth one of the most touching sequences ever to be put in a film, and one that's caused me to choke up from its sheer earnestness.Despite The Kid's emotional sensitivity and appeals to pathos, The Kid is also a light hearted, even delightful film. Chaplin was an entertainer first, and his humor is often uproarious and constantly rolling along. His mastery of physical comedy and slapstick, along side with a tender exploration of poverty and human connection, brings a nicely balanced story, and one that proves to be entertaining as it is reflective. Chaplin's satire is vigorous, biting, and self aware, but he never stoops into cynicism or losing faith in mankind's goodness.Chaplin's skill with using physical movement and visual storytelling to convey pathos is second to none. While most silent film stars of the time mainly used the medium for light entertainment, or to spread the occasional revisionist propaganda, but Chaplin was one of the first who actually used the medium of film to his advantage and explore more difficult, challenging topics. Like Griffith, he had the foresight to see that film could be much more than mere entertainments (though without the racism). Chaplin was a man who wanted to make the world as bright as it could be, he was one who wasn't afraid to embrace hope without stooping into escapism or overt melodramatics, he was a man who made it his life's mission to make the world as good and beautiful as it could be. Chaplin will always be the eternal optimist, undaunted by cynicism or pessimism.With The Kid, Chaplin showed the world what he could truly do, with all restraints off, and that he wasn't just a one trick funny man.

I can't speak to what society was like in the 20's, but by todays standards It's quite a narrow view. Clearly a lot has changed within society, with less tight fitting social roles that apply to gender. Obviously, this film was somewhat of a comedy, given Chaplin's slapstick bit.

Not the black and white, I've seen plenty of those, but the silent aspect. It almost forced me to pay attention to what was going on or I wouldn't quite understand the next coming segments. The general plot, which was Chaplin's experience \"adopting\" an abandoned child, can still be seen as relevant to issues today since yes there are millions of children in the world who have been abandoned/adopted due to all sorts of circumstances, and I believe the film could bring awareness to that. Chaplin's humorous bits were good too, and of course by today's standards most films have humor sprinkled in.\nThus for these reasons, it may be an 100 year old vintage film compared to today's standards, but I thought it was cool, and the plot it carried.Now, moving on to the film's society. It surprised me to see the dialogue wasn't extremely different from how we communicate today - it was easy to understand and it didn't contain as many obsolete terms/outdated ways of saying things as I expected it would. But again the dialogue really wasn't that much and if the film wasn't silent I could have expected a lot more old language. Somehow, I don't think the parts around abandoning the child, or taking him in would have changed from that time period. The number of children being abandoned has probably (and hopefully) decreased substantially since that time, but other than that I don't think much else has changed too much.Chaplin's acting was good. I enjoyed the humorous segments and I feel like they were a nice addition to an all silent film, otherwise I wouldn't have enjoyed it being too monotonous throughout. Besides I'm pretty sure he was known for his slapstick acts so it would probably be important that he incorporated some in there.The morals addressed in the film could and would still be topics of discussion today, especially about the righteousness of abandoning children on the streets under any circumstances. But then again Chaplin does decide to take the child in as his own anyway, and somehow I felt like the plot was intended to \"teach\" the audience what the right thing was to do. Just my theory.\nFor the Angels and Demons scene, putting aside the topics of accidental pregnancies, and child affordability issues, I think this dreamland scene was clearly put in to portray the two morally good vs bad in the film, but specifically what they represented symbolically I'm not too sure.It would be a given to most that the star would naturally be Charlie Chaplin himself. I agree with that, but I believe the child was a star too. I remember you said his acting was really well done and I think so too, especially at a time when an early 20th century society did not have as many resources as we do today. Besides, the name of the film is literally \"The Kid\", so I don't think this film would be necessarily complete without one of them,", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "It's Good.", "date": "2020-10-15T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6178762"}, {"content": "The kid is a film starring Charlie Chaplin as the tramp raising an orphan boy. Now before watching I highly recommend thinking how film back then was still incredibly primitive and films didn't even focus on story. some would say this doesn't fit with todays standards which I don't really agree with. A tale of raising a child and the thought of losing them is still very much relevant today however technology the used to do so is definitely outdated. So I can only half agree on this film not fitting in. Another example is how society is portrayed, still being accurate to this day, only things that I find being different is how everything is the same but evolved if that makes sense. For example the tramp and the kid stay at a sleeping place. I don't know how to word it but the place they stayed in really makes me think of a hotel. Now Charlie's acting. I firmly believe that this film needs slapstick to ease tension in between moments, causing a nice balance of drama and comedy. If the film was just a comedy the story wouldn't work, and if the film was a drama it wouldn't feel like a Chaplin film. The film addresses many morals like raising an orphan, finding out your orphaned son is being cared of by a lower class man, what it means to be a father, and the efforts someone would go to just to see their kid again. The only thing that I can't find a clear connection to the film is the dream sequence with the angels and the devils. From the research I've done it seems Chaplin held a long-standing fascination with dream sequences. Robinson suggests that this arose from appearing in a Fred Karno sketch called, \"Jimmy the Fearless, or the Boy 'Ero\", in which Chaplin played a ragamuffin who embarks on a series of misadventures before waking up and realizing his exploits were all just a dream. One actor named Stanley Jefferson, who played Jimmy for a single performance-Chaplin gave Stanley the boot once he realized the role's promise-suggested the same thing:\n\"Charlie loved to play Jimmy, and the memory of that role and of the production stayed with him all his life, I think. You can see Jimmy the Fearless all over some of his pictures - dream sequences, for instance. He was fond of them, especially in his early pictures. And when it comes down to it, I've always thought that poor, brave, dreamy Jimmy one day grew up to be Charlie the Tramp.\" Now, another question that could be arisen is who the star of the show is. One would say it's Chaplin because the tramp is the main character. The thing is I feel like Chaplin steals the show for more reasons than that. I strongly feel as if Chaplin truly poured his heart and soul into this film as a director and actor. The raw emotion and enthusiasm is so contagious with the way he acts and directs. I would go as far as to say that this film is a masterpiece for all I know. That's all I can really think of.

Because of my absence of knowledge on Chaplin, I truly didn't know what to expect. As I watched this film it continuously felt like I was being brought into a new story. If Chaplin had created this story in 2020, I feel like it would be split up into weekly episodes on TV instead of a full length film.I really admire that a \"single father\" role was represented in the film, something that often isn't shown in film even today. Also, showing a man who is nurturing towards a child in film can be quite uncommon, and I'm sure it was even more uncommon in the 1920's.The idea of making authority look foolish has remained through out the past 100 years. In pop-culture today, the belittling of authority is shown throughout music videos, social media, and film. Making Chaplin's \"The Kid\" very much watchable today for the story, but not so much for comedy purposes as the level of comedy which entertains people today is much different than in Chaplin's time.I definitely give props to Chaplin for his creativity in the angels and devils scene, although I don't completely understand it's place in the story. It was very unexpected, and once again I felt as though I was brought into but another film.Overall, I'm happy to have experienced Chaplin's work, as much of it began the roots of the film we see today.

When watching his film I was able to recognize how progressively society has changed. It is interesting to see how the range from old classics to modern movies has changed within details such as the length of the cut; color, range of light and sound has all drastically changed. While realizing the progressions of film the audience is still able to appreciate Chaplin's hysterical comedy using gags, pranks and gestures, which is rare to find in modern movies. Although many aspects in the film evolved and changed, the emotional connection the audience has with The Kid remains a timeless attribute. The evolution of communication has drastically changed in the past 100 years, which we can see in Chaplin's films.Chaplin's slapstick and mimicking acting in The Kid was thoroughly impressive as he makes use of exaggerated movements. He is able to emotionally persuade the audience using actions, alongside his sidekick and co - star Jackie Coogan. Chaplin's acting successfully adds to the film tremendously. A highlight of this film was when Jackie was forced in a back of a truck and a powerful and raw performance takes place.Chaplin persuades his strong morals in The Kid. Noticing how when the mother does charity work, she crosses paths with Jackie.

For it being 100 years old and being a silent film I believe it's a great and heart warming movie. The plot may be simple but it's straight forward and easy for the audience to understand. I found the movie entertaining to watch and can just imagine all the hype and excitement it received from when it was in it's prime. The storyline doesn't seem to different compared to some movies today, the only difference being how we make them. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed it, and the actors did a great job presenting the emotion of the characters. With the movie having no sound, it's just straight up impressive. Expression in emotion and movement were a key factor in order to the audience to get engaged with what's happening.\nChaplin himself is an excellent actor! His slapsticks are funny and few made me chuckle. He was careful to put in the right amount of comedy into this story, that it isn't completely serious until later in the movie. It tells the audience that he doesn't film JUST comedic films, but also stories. Like today's movies, I like a sprinkle of comedy in them.The real star though is the Kid himself, Jackie Coogan. Throughout the movie I was very impressed at how well he played his part. It's hard to overlook his talent for his age. He was one of the first child actors in Hollywood and I can't help but feel proud of him. Chaplin and Jackie make the perfect comedic duo, for they earned some chuckles from me and many others that watched.\nDuring the movie, it warmed my heart on how the Tramp treats him as his own even though he is not blood. Personally I can relate to that, my Oma and I aren't blood to our family, but we are family nonetheless. And they don't treat us any differently. Adopted children may not know who their biological parents are or why they gave them up, or even loved them, but when one overlooks those thoughts and focuses on the family they have now. It's all they ever need. My Oma can agree.The scene with the angels and devils kind of came out of nowhere. Even though the plot is good, the dream scene doesn't seem to be of any importance to the story. When I think about it, I suppose it relates to when the Kid was taken from him. He was happy and things seemed more joyful with him around. The Devils are a bit more confusing, I thought that they represented human nature, how we all are flawed no matter how 'good' we think we are.While watching, I've noticed how much has changed over the past 100 years. Back then, everything seemed... quicker. As in, you can call in a doctor while today you call an ambulance or go to a clinic. The process of certain instances seemed to have less paperwork and discussion involved.. to me at least. As for the neighbourhoods', in some countries it may not be to different to today when we look at families struggling in poverty. The clothing has certainly changed though. And for the policeman, he wasn't wearing a bullet vest or doing whatever he pleased. He was doing his job back then. He was harsh on the Tramp and the Kid, but only because they were pulling some scams and whatnot. I'm sure there were corrupt police back then, especially towards certain races like today, but they aren't wearing riot gear like policemen today in good ol' US of A. Types of policemen differ in different countries, but racism still exists. I can imagine the amount of unjust that happened 100 years ago, and now... ever since George Floyd's death. We. Are. Done.

You could really feel the relationship building with him and this orphaned child, as he really didn't know what to do with this random baby at the start. However, the actor I believe steals the movie, is the child. Since it's a silent film, I would have thought that a child would have a tough time expressing and showing emotion, but he did everything flawlessly, especially when he's getting taken away on the back of the truck. Towards the end though, in the \"dream\" sequence, I believe that scene to bring the emotion and suspense down. I was so confused, thinking he died, and I think it was just plain unneccessary.

I often find it difficult to enjoy silent films as over my lifetime I have mainly seen them in museums I've been taken to for academic purposes, and I have connected the idea of silent film to the often too-much feeling of having more information than I could possibly need shoved in my head at once. With this in mind, I was pleasantly surprised when I was able to find genuine interest and entertainment watching this movie, even with it being 100 years old.I think this movie has stood well in history, showing a genuinely interesting and engaging storyline through physical comedy and tragedy. Despite the years that have passed since this movie came out, I think it still holds true to society's perspective of single fatherdom, the fight for staying alive in economically suffering areas, and the fight against people of more power. Although things have changed slightly; orphanages are not as commonly used as a first choice for orphans, and Chaplin's character wouldn't be shamed in today's society for taking in a child and raising him, the main themes of societal standards remain. I think Champlin did an amazing job in this film, his acting and comedy was well timed despite the sadness of the storyline. I think the acting done by Chaplin as well as the other main characters (the mother, and the boy) was perfect because it showed a comedic take on a saddened story, and that slapstick-comedic take enhanced the storytelling in a way that plain acting could never have done in those times.A scene I did find pretty strange to watch was the Devil/Angel dreamland scene. I didn't really understand what was about, and how it was relevant. After mulling it over a bit after watching it, I see that it's there to show the good and evil in the world and reflect the unfairness of the loss of Chaplin's characters kiddo and the way that life is full of good and bad. It was also cool to see the way that Chaplin had to make peace with the idea of loss in his dreamland to wake up and find peace in his real life.I really enjoyed this movie and think it has a story that has withstood 100 years extremely well.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "A silent film that took me by surprise", "date": "2020-09-26T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6124618"}, {"content": "The Kid is a classic film made by Charlie Chaplin. It tells the story of The Tramp who adopts an orphaned child and is pursued by the authorities. This movie was truly iconic in it's time, and I believe the plot and acting still lives up to this day. Even though I found it long at times, it seems to have held up well and managed to be a vintage piece of film while still being significant to society. Especially now, there's a huge stigma towards police and Chaplin's film portrayed them with that same stigma. It's quite relevant to the fact that police tend to abuse their power, particularly towards the less fortunate. Well shot and well written, this film manages to stand up almost 100 years later.The most confusing scene by far was the angel scene near the end. Chaplin dreams he is in heaven and has become an angel along with his neighbours. I believe Charlie, now that the kid had been taken, truly realizes how good he had it and misses him. He felt that his 'heaven' was destroyed and ripped from him, just as the scene shows us with the devils introducing sin and violence to his happy new home. The scene seemed incongruous with the rest of his movie and just didn't fit. Even though the scene depicts something important to Chaplin, I found it unnecessary and somewhat strange.Chaplin's acting was quite impressive. I believe he isn't being overwhelmingly comedic in this movie, he's trying to be more serious and move the viewers. He cried for the first time in his film history, striking a chord with his audiences. His slapstick wasn't over done and didn't take away from the true story he was trying to tell. In fact, I find it added more to the plot and made the movie more enjoyable overall. But the true star was Jackie Coogan, better known as The Kid. He was one of the first child actors and pulled off an amazing performance for his age. He and Chaplin had extreme chemistry, which worked well in their favour. Without him, there would be no movie at all.The Kid was the tour de force of its time and meant a lot to Chaplin. He poured his heart into this movie, and it clearly paid off. This film would mean more to parents and young children than teenagers. Young children tend to find falling over and silly humour more entertaining, and the loss of a child means so much more to people who've already had them.

While the film is around 100 years old, I believe it's still very watchable. The production is amazing for a film that old, while of course it was limited by the technology of the time I think the subjects with which it deals are still very relevant today. Probably the most important thing shown in the film is how women who have children at a young age or simply don't have the resources to provide for them, are not supported. In the movie this makes \"the Woman\", see getting rid of her child as her only option, because she won't be able to give him everything he will need. To a certain degree that still happens today, as even though there are planned parenthood centres and some support for single mothers, a lot of times they aren't ready, and are shunned by their family for something that isn't necessarily their fault. The film is probably also based on Chaplin's experience as child who had to basically grow up without parents. The character of \"the Man\" could also be based on Chaplin's own father, who was an alcoholic who was never there for his family. In the film. the Man seems like he isn't doing too bad for himself, but still decides not to provide for a child he brought into the world. The acting in the film is surprisingly good, Jackie Coogan (\"the Kid\") does an unbelievable job at his role, and in my opinion he is the star of the film, since it all revolves around him. While in the film \"the Tramp\" (Chaplin) may not be the most successful, he cares for the Kid as if he was his own, which ultimately he is. A father is someone who will always give his son unconditional love and try to give his child the best he can, not necessarily the biological father. Chaplin fulfils this role in the film, and I can say he is the face of kindness of the movie. His acting is also excellent, and his slapstick humour doesn't take anything from the film, instead it helps be a sort of comic relief and help the film maintain a more or less playful tone. A scene which I'm not quite sure why it was included or how it adds to the story is the one where the Tramp is dreaming and he sees a world of angels who are sort of corrupted by demons. My best guess is that he is trying to show how even the best people will sometimes make bad decisions or can be influenced to do things they will later regret. Another thing the scene could signify are Chaplin's own demons from his personal life, and how even when he is a good person he makes mistakes too. Overall this is a good film, as it deals with real life problems that are even still relevant today.

Though it's lacking a bit in depth, the story still holds up 100 years later, seamlessly blending together humour and heartbreak. While the idea of the story alone is rather dark - an orphan boy being taken away from the only parental figure he's ever known - Chaplin still manages to have the audience laughing. My one criticism is that before reading the synopsis for the film I had no idea that the mother was going to commit suicide after leaving the baby in the car. Maybe this was just me, but that detail went right over my head.The chemistry between the actors in the film was great. Chaplin, the kid, and the woman all fit perfectly into their roles. I think that Jackie Coogan stole every scene he was in as the kid; especially when he was throwing the rocks through the windows - the way he ran captured that of a younger Chaplin. He is undeniably fantastic and his style of acting mixes perfectly with Chaplin's to create a timeless film.The dream sequence was confusing to watch at first, but as I had more time to digest the film I began to understand more how the angels and devils represent the balance of life. By the time Chaplin falls asleep on his doorstep he's already lost the kid and dreams of reuniting with him in this sort of perfect world, but soon he realizes that no world is perfect (hence, the devils.) I think it was an incredibly beautiful choice to have Chaplin having to die and leave the kid in the dream world to be reunited in reality.

I didn't really know how I'd feel about it, but after watching it I am very glad I did. This movie is a timeless piece of art. I absolutely loved watching this film as it felt like I was seeing the 1920's for myself. As the movie isn't fully realistic as Chaplin walks around in his slapstick style, it is very cool to me that I can see something filmed so long ago, in a normal realistic setting. This movie is completely watchable, even 100 years later. The star of this film \"The Kid\", played by Jackie Coogan made me want this movie to be longer. Coogan did a wonderful job as playing this mischievous, loving and goofy kid. I have a hard time wrapping my head around that a six year old can act this well. Chaplin also does a great job playing his iconic role \"The Tramp.\" I saw a side of his character that I didn't expect to see, a soft and caring side while taking care of The Kid. This softer more caring side of The Tramp, plus his slapstick acting create this unique character that I really enjoyed. The only thing I felt lost on was the devils and angels scene. It may have made sense at the time (1920's), but in 2020, It left me feeling quite lost, although it was a fun scene to watch.

Although it is a silent movie, the storyline and character expression in it, I think that it is not lost to the current sound movie, which is more abundant than the sound movie. Fuller, this is the so-called classic.\nThe film probably tells about a poor London woman who abandoned illegitimate children in a car in front of a rich man 's house, but the car was stolen, and the thief threw the child beside the trash can. The child picked it up to raise him and named him Jony. This decision revealed the chance of coincidence in the raising process, which made people laugh. I think this may be the relationship between Charlotte and the child.\nWhen the child grew up to four or five years old, Charlotte took him out to work. The child first threw a stone through the window of the family, Charlotte stepped forward to change the glass, was caught by the police, and was visually left. Locke tried to kick him away when Jony wanted to go with him. This paragraph impressed me a lot, and now I feel quite like it.\nLater, the charity of the country wanted to send the child to the kindergarten. Charlotte fought with the people who came, wanted to take the child back, and even over the roof, catching up with the flying truck, this section made me deeply Resonating, not all the parents in the world, in order to protect their children, they tried their best to make people cry, and finally Charlotte again embraced Jony in his arms.\nCharlotte could not return to the top floor where he lived, so he took the children to the nightclub. He had no money and had to go first, and then opened the window to let Jony climb in. The film revealed Charlotte's constraints everywhere, but he still Adopted Jony, which shows Charlotte's inner beauty.\nAt the end of the movie, there was a picture of an angel. I did n't understand it too much at first. Then I found out the name of the movie, \"The Story of Searching for a Fairy\", and then suddenly realized that when the police finally led Charlotte to the end Going to Jony's biological mother's house, he and Jony hugged tightly, making the movie finally complete.\nWhen watching this movie, we can easily find that although this movie is silent, it accompanies this music from beginning to end. With the slow, brisk, and exciting music, the development of the plot also fluctuates. When Charlotte found it in the hotel When the child is lost, the music is suddenly heated up, and we deeply understand Charlotte's anxiety through the music. I think the role of music in this silent film is very important. It makes up for the monotony of silent films, allowing people to deeply appreciate the ups and downs of the plot and add to the atmosphere.\nWhen the actor cannot communicate the language in the silent film, I think, this will inevitably require the actor to have a strong performance, so that the audience can understand the character's feelings and inner activities. What impressed me was the brother of a kid who was fighting with Jony. He showed his strong feeling everywhere, but later when he was fighting with Charlotte, we looked at his movements and found that his limbs might be Flexible but his head doesn't seem to have much aura, he just fully shows what he is like with his body movements.

Of course, the big star here is Charles Chaplin. He was around the age of 30, slightly over probably when he wrote, directed and starred in this film. It is still a contender for his most known work. It has a number of six-digit ratings here on imdb, which is really a lot for a film from the black-and-white silent film days. Of course it helps how easily accesible it is nowadays. But other factors are helping as well, for example that this one is in the top100 highest rated films here on imdb. And the name Chaplin is always a crowd magnet. I had the chance to watch this film today at a theater for the very first time and I was baffled how the room (and it was a really big room) was basically packed. One reason way maybe that there was no fee, but also it was a midnight screening, so yeah, definitely something many people wanted to watch.Now let me talk about the film itself a bit. I must say I really liekd some parts while others did not do too much for me. I quite enjoyed the prologue if you want to call it that in which the Tramp (Chaplin) finds the baby and tries to get rid of it right away again. However, a pretty resilient other of another child and also a policeman won't make it easy for him. There were some moments like when the baby ends up with said woman repeatedly or also very early when Chaplin enters the picture and finds the baby, he thinks maybe somebody threw it down too like the stuff that is thrown out of the windows before that. That moment to me showed how Chaplin was really so far ahead of its time comedy-wise. This moment also could have worked nicely in a modern comedy show. I am not saying Chaplin's other comedy is dated, not at all, but it is stuff that would not really work today anymore I believe, but back then it did and as it is from back then, most of it has aged well. So I think after this prologue, the film gets slightly worse. But there are still many funny moments like how we see on several occasions that the kid turned out as chaotic as its \"dad\", but no surprise if you are being brought up by the Tramp. Still, there are also many moments that are really sweet between the two and you can see how much of a connection they had. By the way, I was pretty surprised the film moved forward so much in time this early. Usually, jumps of so many years you see only at the end as an epilogue or so. But not here. Pretty unusual. I also wondered about what happened to the other woman with kid from early on since then or if the crooks got caught perhaps for something else they did. My second favorite sequence after the introduction was probably the boxing sequence. That was really hilarious from beginning to end and you could also see how much fun they had, especially the child actor. And pretty hilarious how the Tramp tries to convince the brute that the other kid won the fight, so that he himself will be spared from the massive fists of the guy. Some nice special effects there of how some bricks fall out when he punches the wall or how the lantern changes shape. And from the more emotional perspective I liked the scene when we have mother and son sit next to each other on the stairs not knowing about their relationship. Sadly, there were also sequences that didn't do too much for me. Maybe the weakest that as far as I am concerned could have been left out completely was the dream sequence with everybody having angel wings. Added nothing for me. Also the long scene with the guys from the orphanage showing up and the following car scenes were not among my favorites, but it was still better than the angel sequence I suppose.Overall, it was a good watch from beginning to end, sometimes better, sometimes slightly weaker, but never really bad, sadly also not frequently enough really good for an enthusiastic thumbs-up from me. So just a normal thumbs-up then. This is one of Chaplin's shorter long films (by imdb standards, where the cut is at 44/45 minutes), so you can watch it really quickly in under an hour, even if there are several versions out there and the longest runs for over an hour. But the one shown at the theater where I was ran for 53 minutes or so. Sadly, I must say that I found the soundtrack was sometimes a bit distracting with how it was always there and actually even very much in your face in less significant scenes and moments. It annoyed me a bit, also because the sound was really loud, but that is obviously nothing that Chaplin did wrong. On a completely different matter, I am pretty surprised Carl Miller's The Man is first credit here because there were several far more significant characters than his and he is really in it all for the comedy only. The key characters are united at the end: the Tramp, the mother and the child. The ending was really abrupt though I must say, but it worked well as it stays somewhat in the mind because it is really the very first scene where the 3 are united. All that may or may not follow afterwards is up to your imagination. I guess with the picture in the flames from the guy early on, he may not be the woman's true love. Okay finally still a few words on the cast: Coogan was not just among the most successful child actors from his generation, but managed to have a long career afterwards until his death. As for Purviance and Chaplin especially, there needs not too much to be said. Their bodies of work speak for themselves. And Miller was also fairly prolific. The outcome is a good watch all in all. If you have not seen aynnthing from Chaplin to far, this could be a good choice to get started.

It's fading into each other rather than just cutting into the new scene.Also, the score for this movie already has me hooked on the movie itself even before the five minute mark. The music is very good at representing the emotions you're supposed to be feeling during the movie without being able to hear what is actually going on. I love how reluctant Chaplin is to take in the baby, but when he decides to take it home you can see his facial expressions become slightly softer, as if he's starting to like the child. The ways he attempts to care for the child are very unique and pleasant to watch. By the time it gets to 5 years later, the expressions by both actors let you know that they have gotten in sync with each other and have created a routine around each other. The scene where the child is making pancakes to me, proves how good he was raised and how responsible the kid is. Next, the entire time when the child was being taken away was very emotional, both the facial expressions and the score really add to the sadness of the scene. Jumping ahead to the end, I like ho wit was not given away that the policeman was taking Chaplin to see the kid, this sort of surprise at the end made me enjoy the movie more. I typically enjoy happy endings, so I was very glad that this movie had one. Overall, I really liked this movie.

This is much to the chagrin of local bad boys, the cops, and what passed for Child Services in 1921. Jackie Coogan is the Kid (he'd go on to greater fame in the 1960s as Uncle Fester in The Addams Family), and man can he act.

In particular, there's an extended fight scene involving Coogan and an older boy, followed quickly by one with Chaplin and a top-heavy bully (the other boy's brother).

His work has been known to provoke as much heart and pathos as it does laughter and smiles. However, out of all the film's he's made, The Kid might be the most heartfelt and bitterly sweet out of them all, mainly because this was a very personal film for Chaplin. Considering that he ended up getting taken away from his parents at a young age, one could only imagine how much this film meant to him. But how does it hold up today?The film focuses on Chaplin's famous Tramp after he discovers a little orphan and raises him, but then the orphanage reclaims him after the original mother finds out. Chaplin was a master at getting emotions across through strong performances, and the great acting helps establish the Tramp's relation with the boy as charmingly genuine. Whatever happens to the boy is all on the Tramp's hands, and the Tramp really is a guy who tries his best to care for the lad in spite of his impoverished lifestyle. While the ending is obvious by today's standards, the film makes you work for that ending by piling up so much drama and uncertainty throughout, succeeding well in the suspense department.The filmmaking is another added bonus, with plenty of distinct editing tricks and fast paced action to liven up the viewing experience. Even though the score was obviously recorded much later (the 1971 version is all that survives after all), it is well timed to the motion on screen, and it is quite memorable and harmonious in its own regard. It really helps when a soundtrack can make a feature come to life as much as solid acting and slapstick. My only complaint with the film is that the moment with the kid getting into a fight with a bully about his age goes on too long. While it does give the kid a good reason to defend himself, it kind of drags on too much and it doesn't even go anywhere afterwards.I can definitely see why Chaplin deemed this to be the most characteristically distinct out of all his work, since his childhood memories are all over this metaphorically. There aren't too many features that depict the bringing up of children in the poor population whilst depicting them in a positive light, so this film is a pure example of highlighting parenthood in the lower class.

But please, don't get me wrong, we are talking about an almost 100 years-old-movie that is still able to touch people's fellings, and this is HUGE. I love the movie, its importance, and the way it influenced cinema moving foward. The fact that isn't better than others Chaplin movies is not a demerit by any means.One thing I start to realize is that Chaplin was not only a comedy genius, but also a storyteller genius, he always try to pass some message within his movies. Talking about the ones I've seen, Shoulder Arms approaches the war, Modern Times the new \"tecnologic era\" (always with a society approach), and The Kid it's no different, it talks about family and love, but in a deep way. It's almost like what Pixar does nowadays, some can go see their movies and just have fun without think that much about it, but, others can pay more attention to the details and look deeptly at it.To wrap up, The Kid is a cute and beautiful movie, and even though isn't Chaplin greatest work, it's way above 99,9% of the movies that were release in the same time period. Obs: I can't help talking about the \"dream\" sequence. I really think that it took me out of the movie for some seconds, and, man, the ones who know Chaplin's story know that the girl he kisses ended up being his second wife, but, man... it's weird to see a 30 years something dude kissing a 12 years-old girl, even in 1921.

The fact that he is perhaps the greatest mind of his genre, time and even is considered to have made up a personal form of film-making just shows how defining his choices was. The Kid has only one flaw in the whole story which is the ending dream sequence which melds into the reality of the 'lone prospector' (that seems like perpetually Chaplin's character presentation except in The Great Dictator from what I have seen so far; I would correct myself if I see otherwise). It was jarring and snapped me out of the investment I had in the ending of the story because of what the penultimate scene shows with respect to the kid not being an orphan anymore and how it is resolved.

The film begins with a mother and her infant child. Very early on in the film the mother decides that she simply cannot care for the child, so she abandons it in the rear seat of an unoccupied car. The unoccupied car then because the partially unoccupied car and is subsequently stolen by car thieves. The thieves eventually take notice of the small child in the back seat and, in turn, they abandon it themselves in an alleyway. In this alley is where the iconic figure of Charlie Chaplin's Tramp character is presented and he eventually finds that he will have to be the one to care for the infant. \nTime lapses five years into the future and we find Chaplin and the child, which can now more accurately be referred to as a \"kid\", living together in a raggedy one bedroomed apartment. Chaplin's tramp is clearly presented as a surrogate father figure for the kid, and the two of them appear to coexist in a relationship that is both playful and loving. The rest of the movie unfolds after the stage is set as I just did for you. It is mostly instances of how the two paupers have to swindle there way into sources of income, and the misadventures that come along with it.\nThe film was released in the year 1921. Releasing a film in this time period could be considered overly restricting by some individuals, considering that \"talkies\" had yet to be a staple of the medium. However, Chaplin absolutely encapsulates the melodrama of the story and expertly enables the story to be told through movement and design, rather than through dialogue. \nChaplin's tramp character is the iconic image of Charlie Chaplin that everybody knows even if they have never seen one of his movies. Every aspect of the character from his attire (bowler hat, cane, small waist coat, large trousers and shoes) to his over exaggerated gestures make for an expressive performance that is both memorable and inevitably iconic. It is worth noting the charismatic performance of the kid as well. He is an excited young man that is clearly enjoying himself in the filmmaking process, and his relationship with Chaplin is quite endearing. \n The Kid is an exciting display of creativity that translates into iconic film. A scene that stands out is one in which Chaplin's tramp character is being chased along rooftops by a police officer, and another would be a dream sequence where characters throughout the streets have angel wings that can be purchased at a corner store. It is worth noting the impression that this film must have made upon audiences when it was first released. Even in modern times it comes across and a piece of utterly unique cinema, which is a testament to the acting and filmmaking genius that Charlie Chaplin had.

The Tramp is, of course, Charlie Chaplin, one of the biggest movie stars of the time. The film is touted as being \"6 reels of joy\" in 1920's parlance. Today, it would be known more as a \"film for the whole family\" (rarely is a movie presented on film reels nowadays). Out for a stroll one day, The Tramp spots a baby that is nearly hurt by some debris being thrown out of a window. The Tramp rescues the boy but then tries his best to unload the child anywhere he can, however an annoying, seemingly omnipresent flat-foot quashes any ideas that come to mind. So, The Tramp takes in the boy and raises the child as his own after reading a note the mother left tucked inside his nappy. We play witness to The Tramp trying his best to raise the boy while still being a virtual vagabond.

The Kid is a film that is only about sixty minutes in length, and yet it has far more dramatic impact than most films that are twice as long! Although I seem to only be acknowledging the film's more emotional qualities, there is also no doubting that The Kid is also an extremely funny movie, possibly even among the funniest films ever made. Even within this tale of melancholy, Chaplin is able to inject some of his most clever and creative slapstick routines. With the help of child co star Jackie Coogan, Chaplin is able to get laughs that will please almost anyone's sense of humor, from the infantile to the elderly. Jack Coogan in particular has surprisingly solid comedic ability and timing, despite his obvious young age. The image of Chaplin picking up Coogan by his overalls as Coogan is in the midst of a fight is just precious, because of Coogan's reluctance to stop fighting. Instead of calming down and succumbing to his father's orders, he wiggles around vigorously, throwing out useless punches and kicks.

He'll make material decrepitude and a very low social status look funny and a simple fact of daily existence, while developing a strong sentimental bond in the plot between himself and one of the other characters: basically you can be a bum, wear one shoe, and eat dirt all day while living in a can, but that takes nothing away from the subtle humanity you'll always carry with you anywhere or your full, profound ability to love.

The movie made me feel so many things! I felt happy for both the kid and the tramp in that they found each other and were able to formulate a life together. I enjoyed seeing their relationship progress and develop. I couldn't help but think about the kid's mother and feel sad for her, though I enjoyed seeing the tramp come into his own through taking care of the kid. The film was written by Charlie Chaplin, and I enjoyed seeing how Charlie as a writer developed the relationship and love and care between the kid and the tramp. I thought he did a great job in that regard, however, for me it bothers me when there are loose ends in stories and the mother's role and absence in the story really bothered me.Charlie Chaplin also directed the film, and I felt that he did a great job with both the performances of the actors and with the rhythm of the scenes. Jackie Coogan in particular did a wonderful job. His ability to play such a range of emotion \u2013 from being a loving child to the tramp, to \"toughening up\" when the other kid stole his toys, to all of his hurt and anguish when the men were trying to take him to the orphanage. I enjoyed the pacing of the scene where the kid is making breakfast. There's something that's so great and nuanced seeing how they interact with each other and how something so little can be so funny and enjoyable. Edited as well by Charlie Chaplin, I enjoyed the scene where the kid's toys get stolen from the boy and the shots cut between a wide of the two kids fighting, a medium of the two fighting, and onlookers cheering on the fight. I enjoyed the way that those shots were cut together in that they paced things out nicely and allowed for a great entrance by the tramp to come in and rescue the kid. In \"The Kid\", Roland Totheroh does the cinematography. I felt that the quality of the lighting added to the mood of the film in that there was a lot of great contrast. I feel that it's hard to articulate the quality of the lighting with the film done in black and white, but overall each shot seemed to have quite a bit of contrast, which I felt added a lot to the film, particularly in the outdoor scenes. The outdoor scenes were light and airy as opposed to the scenes in the tramp's home that felt a little darker and moodier, but still felt very homey and comforting. All in all, I enjoyed the film. As expressed previously, the only part for me that was particularly jarring was the storyline of the kid's mom.

Another has Coogan getting into a fight with another boy, leading to Chaplin getting into a fight with his (very large, seemingly padded) older brother. Things get sad and pull the heartstrings when the city comes to take Coogan away to an orphan asylum, and it's interesting that the film touches on the rights of an adoptive parent (\"are you his father?\").The extended dream sequence towards the end is strange and creative, and I was quite surprised to read later that Lita Grey, who plays the 'flirtatious angel' in that sequence, was only 12 years old at the time. Three years later, when Chaplin (aged 35) had an affair with her (if you call having sex with a 15 year old 'having an affair'), she got pregnant, and the pair married in Mexico.

The film has quite a solid dramatic backbone too with Chaplin's tramp gradually coming to truly love the baby who he initially tried to pass on to someone else.

I have watched several of Charlie's movies like the 1931 masterpiece 'City Lights' and the wonderful world of 'Modern Times'. You are hugely mistaken if you think movies of the past are superannuated. In fact, I used to think like that too until I watched City Lights. On the other hand, The Kid was released years before City Lights. It is not an overstatement to call Charlie a genius. The Kid, even being such an old movie, has a rich plot. One of the main characteristics of Charlie's films are the details. If we watch his movies carefully each and every scene have a grandeur of details. One example of a clever yet a powerful detail from the movie, for a 1921 movie, as I remember, was a scene when Charlie showed \"the kid\" to the women outside his house. The women asked Charlie the name of the kid. Charlie didn't knew the name. He would have told any random name but he didn't as he didn't knew if the kid was a boy or a girl. So, he goes into the house; checks; comes out and instantly tells the ladies \"John\". It takes some time to get all the jokes as we the people of 21st century are not used to silent comedy.The plot of The Kid is quiet simple but pretty effective for a 1921 movie. A depressed woman abandons her new born baby. A tramp (Charlie Chaplin) notices the baby and tries to find his mother but he can't. In the end he takes the baby to his home. The story then takes a leap of five years. The baby now helps the tramp in his day to day endeavors to earn money. The kid also helps him in the kitchen. There is a lot of humor content in this part of the story. Jackie Coogan did an outstanding job as the Kid. You don't expect much from a child artist but this little guy was beyond exceptional. After half an hour the story takes a dramatic turn and the kid fells sick. When the doctor comes to their house he notices that the tramp is not the real father of the kid. This information somehow gets to the City Orphanage. They try to take the kid away from the tramp but the tramp doesn't give up on the kid. He fights everyone for the kid. This part of the story shows the love that have been cultivated between the tramp and the kid in the last five years. The movie clearly shows how two people doesn't need to be kith and kin to care for each other.As for a movie nearly a century old one can't complain about the camera and sound effects. I could call the direction a fairly decent one but it's was more of a clever one than just being a simple one. The set direction was very impressive, 8/10 for that. Costume design was good too. If you are into entertainment and movies, this movie is a must watch for you. It's really interesting to see all the techniques used in the past to present a story. For others, I guarantee this movie won't disappoint you. We talk about movies like Godfather and Star Wars as timeless but these movies are not even half as old as Charlie Chaplin's movies.

Your shining suit of scepticism should be worn at all times, weary traveller. Although a fun and enjoyable film, The Kid which has been met with steady and sustained acclaim since its debut in 1921, you could argue is a good example of such criticism gone awry. It's a sometimes-amusing and often-heart-warming feature, sure, but a masterpiece? Not so much. At least not for me. The comedy's plot which revolves around the Tramp adopting an abandoned orphan from infancy before fast-forwarding five years where they run a bit of a racket together, is light and fluffy and has a distinct charm permeating the interactions between the two actors. But aside from a few sight gags and one touching piece of drama, there's not much else to be had from the experience and by the time it reaches the 40 minute mark, feels a bit winded. So much so that Chaplin tacks on a bizarre dream sequence seemingly to fill up some time. Critics often praise this scene as \"out of the box\" and \"daring\" and they're right. What they often overlook however is the fact that it's rather useless and superfluous to the already very little going on. It's no surprise to find out that The Kid came at a time when Chaplin was creatively bankrupt and had been so for quite some time. This scene in particular along with the more famous abduction scene are key examples of where film criticism seems ardently opposed to calling a good film a good film instead of throwing more unwarranted praise into an already overflowing river of rose-tinted admiration. The abduction scene which I reference is great, yes, and rich in pathos, but claims of it being the most emotive scene in a comedy, nay film in general (yes this is claimed, believe it or not) are about as grounded as Chaplin's take on whether dogs go to heaven or not. The Kid is a lovely and charming miniature film with affecting performances resulting in some good laughs here and there that must have raised roofs in 1921, but that's it. Nothing else. Anybody who tells you there's more to it than that is probably just as likely to make an argument for swapping your mortgage in exchange for a 100- year-old bottle of wine. Because it's distinguished, it's cultured, it's a classic and you obviously just don't get the whole picture. Instead I'll let you in on a little secret.

That cab is taken by nefarious crooks, with them eventually realizing that the kid is in the vehicle, abandoning him in an alley! That is when fate would lead penguin-wobbly Tramp to find the kid. Eventually the Tramp and kid would bond and learn to survive together, doing whatever they could to make ends meet (including one hilarious job of repairing windows, with the kid hurling rocks into windows with Tramp \"just passing through\" to help for a voluntary fee). Eventually the welfare folks would be told by a misanthropic doc that the kid (Jackie Coogan, just adorable) needed a home better than his current arrangement with the Tramp. The remainder of the film has the Tramp trying to hold onto the kid with difficulty. The heartstrings are certainly intentionally pulled as the Tramp and kid hug after being pulled apart by the welfare officer, doctor, and police officer\u0085the cop chasing the Tramp who is chasing the truck carrying the kid is a significant scene. The \"dreamland\" sequence is a dazzler as the Tramp falls asleep at the doorstep of his locked home (a dump but home just the same), carried away into a dream where he's among angels, and the kid, falling prey to mischief orchestrated by devils (a female angel is lured into seducing the Tramp which leads to her brutish beau and an angel police officer (!) getting involved. The managing to live through meager means (how they live in their little home, making pancakes, keeping themselves clean and fed (I loved how the Tramp counts their flapjacks to make sure each has the same amount), and using whatever resources were available to them), the unavoidable brawl that exists in this poverty-row street environment (the kid is goaded by a bully looking to start something) which soon has the Tramp trying to keep from getting himself throttled by a dump brute (he's the brother of the boy getting pummeled by Coogan!), and the chummy flirtation between the Tramp and a copper's missus (how the Tramp finds out and has to flee is priceless!) are all fun highlights. The Olvera Street location, its crumbling neglect quite an assist to the story told by Chaplin, lending a great deal of aesthetic significance to its characters and their existence in less-than-desirable surroundings, is quite vital to the film's power. The addition of the manipulative music just adds further emotional power to the images, whether during the more spirited comedic action or potently melodramatic scenes. A triumph.Watch for the scene early on where the Tramp, momentarily before coming to his senses instead of following desperation's talking, contemplates dumping the baby in a sewer when opening a road grate!

I think the opening intertitle said it best \"a picture with a smile and perhaps, a tear.\" It was much like many of his other films in that it blends slapstick comedy with an incredible amount of heart. I watch hundreds of films every year, and the number one thing that bothers me is when a film tries to be something it's not. Whether that means it focuses too much on one genre or tries to do way too much with its script, I can assure you that The Kid does not have these issues. I think this is most prevalent when the Tramp, played by Chaplin, is running across rooftops trying to catch up to his adopted son being taken away by the authorities. I laughed multiple times as Chaplin pulls the clumsy Tramp gags he does so well but it was hard to hold back tears a few seconds later as he reunites for a few moments with his son.The performances are also worth mentioning. Jackie Coogan, who plays the five year old boy, John, that Chaplin adopts, really nails the humor. As far as I know it was the first major role for someone so young, and Coogan gives a memorable performance. The scene in which he is breaking windows for his father to fix and constantly running away from the police officer is very reminiscent of so many of Chaplin's gags. Although Coogan was great, Chaplin is why you watch the film, and I think The Kid is about as personal of a performance as you will get from Chaplin. He had just buried his infant son shortly before filming began on The Kid. His performance is evidently flooded with closeted emotion. Even considering my favorite film of his, City Lights, I think The Kid is his most emotionally powerful film.I think the fact that this film came out in 1921, shows just how ahead of its time it was. Before the film and even a little bit after, adult actors were playing child roles. At least Chaplin and the studio had the guts to put their faith in a young five year old, and I think everyone can agree, it paid off. The film does have some dated elements though. For instance, the bully that the Tramp fights is noticeably wearing a stuffed shirt to make him look buff and more intimidating, something that films would never do now-in- days. Considering the bully punches through bricks and takes down a light post with his bare hands, I guess it was worth it. The slapstick comedy angles are very much a figure of silent films in the 20's. The stupidity of some of the fight sequences are both very dated but endlessly entertaining.So even though The Kid can be taken as a slapstick comedy, I think it's the dramatic and thought provoking elements that make the film so special. To a certain extent, this film deals with the age old question of \"who is qualified to be a parent?\" Of course, it appears the film does have a happy ending but I wonder what happens next. What happens after the lady gets her son back, does the Tramp lose him forever? What gives her the right to take back her baby after giving it up in the first place? Is the fact that the Tramp poor play a factor into the decision to take the kid away from him? I think it's these questions that make this film more than just a laugh out loud comedy and a film that should be studied and understood to be way ahead of its time. I think that's why I always seem to enjoy Chaplin's films, they deal with political and real life issues without bashing these ideas and opinions over the viewer's heads. To me, The Kid exudes a language unspoken in that it takes on issues and ideas that just weren't looked at in the early 20's.

From his 1914 signing with Mack Sennett's KEYSTONE Film Company, ESSANAY, MUTUAL, then his own company released through FIRST NATIONAL, the \"Little Tramp\" found increased funding, audience recognition and artistic control.* WHEN THE PRODUCTION of THE KID was begun, his power and prestige were at the pinnacle. He had been directing in his first studio, Keystone, but only his shorts. Now he had the prospect of doing a full length comedy feature film. Some surely expressed their doubts about the wisdom of such a move. Was this pushing the envelope too far? NO DOUBT THE neigh sayers had thought that the content would follow a path identical to the 2 reelers that were so successful. This is where his critics greatly underestimated Charlie.THE SIMPLE ADDITION of some rather earthy elements (like illegitimate birth or suspicion of same), the cold & indifferent society at large and the strength of the human needs for love, security and companionship made all the difference.SKILLFULLY BLENDING IN those elements with the adventures and misadventures of the Tramp, Chaplin brought us a movie that was hard to classify. Was it a Comedy? Drama? An Adventure? What? THE ANSWEER IS really quite simple, Y-E-S!NOTE * Of the power and control over his own productions was maximized in 1919; when Chaplin joined with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford and D.W.

BUt at the time it was made, perhaps it was perceived as elaborate. This was longer and had more scenes than many movies at that time. THE STORY is simple, and very well told, with only a few distractions from the main line. The strength of the story is great, drawing from the abandoned child theme from ancient tales (AHM the scholars call it) of Moses, Krishna,... many others probably!! In this a prophecied baby is abandoned due to bad circumstances, and raised by common folk, to grow up to do great deeds. These stories are so fundamental to HUMAN storytelling, that the mere introduction of the idea connects the viewer to the entire history of story telling, a comfort achieved within the first 10 minutes of this movie. The rest of the movie is framed in a very MODERN set of circumstances( at that time).The Camera-work, angles, timing, editing is close to perfect, a marvel perhaps at that time. This beats out vast majority of MODERN movies in quality of image. I am GUESSING they used tripods and abundant light, and rehearsal of shots. CHaplin's later movies (modern times, great dictator) may have improved on this one in technical senses, but THE KID is technically sound enough to meet the requirements of any CINEMATOGRAPHIC- or CLARITY-buff(except the color part). This is a GRAYSCALE movie!!!The ACTING performances are all masterful, they may be slightly overacted by SOUNDED standards, but needed for a silent movie which is to be viewed by people of cultures across the world. THe movements and expressions had to be very universal to be communicated effectively. Remember, even within USA, we had a large variety of cultures within as it we had plenty of regional variation and first or second generation immigrants!! I did not like the overmakeup sometimes, but that is my only criticism of this movie, along with one more criticism which I reserve for people who have not seen the movie yet!!ANY STUDENT of cinema has no business not seeing this movie.COMEDY and DRAMA Fans, will have the best of this movie. ACTION fans, limited scope here, but have several somewhat pioneering scenes, including great rooftop chase(first?...correct me) THREE's Company fans will see where Jack Tripper may have borrowed some of his signature moves.CRYers will have two scenes to refresh their tear ducts.KIDS will be delighted with this easy to follow Film!!T H A N K S F O R R E A D I N G ! ! ! !My review is OVER, THANK YOU!

As an actor, director, producer, writer and composer he shows how to make a perfect blend between humor, drama and a taste of surrealism. It's The Tramp in all its glory. A character that \"speaks\" a universal language and makes us fall in love with it over and over again. Though it isn't The Tramp that steals the show completely. 'The Kid' is the real star of this movie. The child actor arguably gives one of the best ever on screen recorded performances throughout movie history. You can literally feel the pain in his eyes when separated from The Tramp. On the contrary the sparkling eyes touch you when he's with his so called adoption dad. How Chaplin did this is a big question mark. Or should we give the child all the credit? Nonetheless it certainly tells us something about the genius of a storyteller he was and his ability to translate emotions of this kind to the big screen. Although 'The Kid' can be seen as a child of its time the humor is timeless and an universal language everyone speaks. The shots sometimes feel quickly cut but then again this was common for 1920's Hollywood. I must admit Charlie Chaplin is a personal favorite, if not a personal hero.

When the child's mother (Edna Purviance) becomes a famous actress, she decides to perform charity for others, which brings her in touch with the Tramp and her child. Directed by Charlie Chaplin.THE KID is Chaplin's first feature, and is usually cited as a breakthrough in comedy for mixing humor with pathos, or poignancy and sadness. The story is fairly simple but told economically and skillfully \u2013 except for a detour into a rather bizarre \"angels and devils\" dream sequence that doesn't add anything to the narrative. It's really strange and I didn't find it particularly amusing. Except for that, though, the film is quite funny and moving. Charlie Chaplin displays his usual charm as the \"little tramp\" character, but the real revelation here is Jackie Coogan, who plays the kid of the title. His performance is so natural and unforced, so real and vivid, that he went on to become a star during the silent era. The scenes where Chaplin and Coogan's characters are separated are downright heartbreaking, especially due to Coogan's vivid expressions. There are many comical scenes as well, involving the Tramp's window replacing business and his run-ins with the cops, and tender scenes in the Tramp's tenement apartment. Chaplin shows a little more cinematic flair in this film than in many of his shorts, especially with the climactic rooftop chase, and he vividly captures the atmosphere of poverty in which his characters live. He uses undercranking at times to speed up the movement, an effective device that was used commonly in slapstick comedies.

And although that's true I do sense a lot more heart in this film, especially during the opening scene, where I legitimately felt bad for the mother getting rid of her child. Life can be cruel sometimes. That being said because this is a Charlie Chaplin film, and to me the comedy and drama didn't blend that well. And keep in mind this is the only problem I have with the film. Because it's a Chaplin film and because it's about his tramp character, you sometimes can't tell the difference between comedy and drama. Like seriously your son being taken away now is not the time for comedy! Other than that I absolutely adored this film. And it looks like audience members did to. The acting was great, the score was beautiful, and the story is filled with plenty of heart.

We cut to 5 years later when everything seems to be going fine until a doctor (Henry Bergman) finds out about it and comes to take Coogan to a orphanage. But Chaplin fights back and he and Coogan are united. I have to say for a filmmaker who has mostly made a career of of slapstick this actually is a very mature film from Chaplin. It's the first time that he's taken a very grown up topic like parental responsibilities into one of his films. But it's not all completely serious, it's still pretty funny, and the trademark Chaplin slapstick is there. So basically this combines two things that Chaplin was obviously really good at.

The master of pantomime surprised me here by taking a step out of the spotlight and letting it shine on the young newcomer, Jackie Coogan, who steals every scene he is in. Coogan is extremely cute and he held his own next to Chaplin in the comedic department as well. As the title suggests, the main character in this film is the kid who has given the character of the tramp something to live and fight for. The scene that stands out for me is the one where the social workers show up and try to take away his adopted son from him. That scene is a real tearjerker, but at the same time there are some excellent moments of physical comedy that balance them out. The editing was also very well done giving the action scenes some believable effects as Chaplin runs through the roofs to rescue the kid. I actually watched Chaplin's re- edited 1971 version of The Kid that includes an original score and is 15 minutes shorter than the original, but I really enjoyed it and found it moving.This silent film written by Chaplin opens with a sobbing unwed mother (Edna Purviance) walking out of a charity hospital with a baby in arms. Along the way she spots a fancy car in front of a mansion and decides to leave the baby hidden in the back seat with a note asking for whoever finds the baby to take care of him. As she walks away a couple of thieves unexpectedly steal the car and once they discover the baby in the back seat they dump him off in an alley. After having second thoughts for what she did, the mother decides to return to the mansion but once she arrives the owners tell her that the car has been stolen. Meanwhile, the tramp (Charlie Chaplin) stumbles across the baby as he is passing by the alley. At first he tries to get rid of him, but eventually he decides to keep the baby and adopts him. Five years have passed and we are now introduced to the tramp and his kid (Jackie Coogan). He is working as a glazier, and business seems to be going well thanks to his kid who helps him out by smashing the neighbor's windows. The child's real mother has become a famous Opera singer and continues to feel haunted for abandoning her son. She does charity work in the same neighborhood where the tramp and the kid live. The tramp and his kid have overcome many obstacles together, but when the boy becomes ill new trouble arises and it could separate the two forever. The Kid might be almost a hundred years old, but it is still a fascinating watch. It has a great amount of heart and it feels fresh thanks to the tender and sweet story. Chaplin's films are a delight to watch and there is something powerful in the way he portrays his message without using dialogue. His films are told through action and his physical performance is always impressive. In the Kid, Chaplin has found a great sidekick in Coogan, who makes the film all that more tender. I wasn't a huge fan of the dream sequence which felt a bit out of place, but the rest of the film was really a delight. The Kid is a special film and one that cemented Chaplin's status as the best producer, director, writer, and actor during the silent film era. It also has a touching father and son narrative that despite being simple reaches for the heart. It's a beautiful film with a perfect running time for a silent film.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Coogan gives one of the best child actor performances I've seen", "date": "2014-04-23T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3003571"}, {"content": "The Kid (1921) is an indisputable cinematic masterpiece, and one of the greatest films of all-time.

It also offers the filmic possibility that Chaplin would be reunited with his late son.\"The Kid\" is an amazing work of art that helped define cinema's possibility of moving an audience. With Chaplin's official score which was added decades later, it becomes an excellent show to be viewed with the accompaniment of a symphony. (I saw it with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra on 1/31/14.)My only quibble with \"The Kid\" is that Chaplin directed it. With all of Chaplin's films where he was such a dominant artistic influence, direction is one duty I wish he delegated. Chaplin is a good director but he wasn't in the same class as others (e.g., Hitchcock) who followed him. The Kid is interesting to look at, but visually there is some room for improvement.Chaplin's other contributions (i.e., acting, writing, producing, editing and the score) are first-rate. It is too bad that Chaplin and Coogan never worked in film together again. The chemistry between them is sublime. Coogan mimics Chaplin wonderfully; this kid's performance is sensational.The sheer audacity of \"the Kid\" should not be forgotten by contemporary audiences. Chaplin mixes comedy and pathos beautifully, contributing a sense of great intellectual depth. The story has autobiographical elements. Chaplin is allowing a youngster to upstage him. Chaplin's narrative skills moves his audience emotionally in ways that had never been previously experienced with a movie. I really like how Chaplin introduces his character. It is one of his most noteworthy visuals. As the Little Tramp is walking along a street multiple people are dumping garbage that falls near him. This introductory scene really establishes what the Little Tramp represents; and contrasts with the final image substantially.The absurd business that Chaplin manages with Coogan's assistance is exquisite and among early cinema's richest moments. Chaplin makes it seem impossible that his character actually manages to survive with a child in tow by having his character return money to the woman whose window he repairs. I really like how Chaplin consistently suppresses an explanation of how the Tramp survives his misery. This is a good technique for aspiring screenwriters to note.Viewing \"The Kid\" today, preferably in a concert hall with a symphony playing Chaplin's excellent score, remains a tremendously rich experience.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "A rich experience with enormous depth", "date": "2014-02-03T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2954531"}, {"content": "Version I saw: UK bluray release Actors: 7/10 Plot/script: 7/10 Photography/visual style: 6/10 Music/score: 7/10 Overall: 7/10 It could be said that this was Charlie Chaplin's breakthrough film: it was one of the longest films he had made up to this point, having previously focused on short films of around 15-25 minutes' duration. I think it could actually be considered two short films, as it has a lengthy dream sequence midway through it in which Chaplin dreams himself as an angel in paradise.While Chaplin has a deceptive way of seeming effortlessly funny, I feel that this film is more one to smile all the way through than a riotous comedy: there are not as many outright laughs as in some of his other films.However, while it is not as political as other Chaplin films, The Kid does pull a similar trick of sneaking in social issues, and even manages to make them more deeply affecting than in the others I have seen. The scene in which the child is taken away is particularly touching, with the panicked, desperate expressions visible on both of their faces.For my full review, read my Blogspot independent film blog, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk/2014/01/the-kid-1921.html", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 3}, "heading": "Charming, but not riotously funny", "date": "2014-01-04T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2935208"}, {"content": "Charlie Chaplin's \"The Kid\" Chaplin's first feature length film is also his most whimsical.

This film is not as accomplished or as revelatory as his later work ( \"The Gold Rush\", \"The Circus\" or his great masterpiece \"City Lights\" but it does demonstrate his matchless gift for physical humor. It features one his most accomplished bits of slapstick as the tramp fights a bully who is larger than he is. Chaplin when he started this film had just experienced the devastating loss of his infant son and the resultant end of his first marriage. I believe this film represented a sort of catharsis for the filmmaker as well as a sort of wish fulfillment, The film is unique in that at the end the tramp is reunited with his son and with the boys mother. Although not shown it is implied that they will all live happily ever after as a family unit. Thus the film marks the only time the tramp had a completely happy ending. Interestingly Chaplin, an aetheist fills the movie with religious imagery. It is interesting that this non religious man was one of the most spiritual of filmmakers. In the end the film is about redemption. The Tramp is redeemed by his love for his son and the boys mother who abandons him at the beginning achieves her own redemption when she is reunited with her lost son.

Before then, most silent films were still short and quickly put out. It took nearly a year for Chaplin to finish this movie. Although this film started out as another short film, by the time it was done, Charles taken more shots and retakes than any film before as done. By completion, it had grown into a six reel feature film. The Kid is thought to be influenced by Chaplin's own childhood and what was happening at the time in his life. At the time his wife Mildred Harris was pregnant. On 1919, she gave birth to a malformed boy that die 3 days later. The event took its ton on Chaplin's personal life. It seems to have influenced Chaplin's work, as he planned a film that turned the Tramp character into the father figure of a young boy. You can see that he transmute his personal pain into something that stir people hearts. His relationship with Mildred Harris have become soured to the point, that Charlie Chaplin became afraid of her trying to steal the film from him during the divorce hearings. The film opens up with an unwed poor mother (Edna Purviance) coming out of a hospital with a baby. You can tell it's illegitimate, as in Chaplin's life, who was himself illegitimate, edits the image of the father an artist burning the photo of the woman. The woman hold the baby and walks as if Jesus holding a cross which is shot fading out. It's hard to tell what Chaplin meant with this explicit Christian symbolism, but the symbolisms returns throughout the film confusing more people. I can only sense that Chaplin was going for fragility, and transience of true moments of human love, over the sacrifice of pain. By having a halo seem to appear the mother head for a few moments, it might represent Virgin Mary. Anyways, she comes across on her self-journey seeing a bride who just got marry. The bride drops a withered flower, symbolizing her loss of virginity. By doing this, I believe it represent her sacrifice her life by marrying an old man that she does not love for money. Within a few seconds, Chaplin takes pose symbolism that commit on hypocritical American piety, puritanism, and organized religion. It's hard to make a saint out of this movie character when she gives up the kid in hope of a better life by leaving the child in a rich person's car. Instead of an rich person finding the baby, two thefts stole the car, and tossed the baby out near some trash cans. It is there, that the Tramp (Chaplin) find the baby and does everything at first to dispatch of the baby, even contemplating throwing the infant into a street grating. While it might be a bit funny, its dark humor isn't what I thought of this family movie coming in. It was a bit disturbing for the Tramp to even think that way. Anyways, the Tramp accepts fatherhood, and adopts the kid. 5 years pass, and the baby grew up as John (Jackie Coogan). John help the Tramp get work by breaking windows for him to fix. Meanwhile, the grief-stricken Edna has seen the error of her ways and leaded a life of charity. Edna and John meets when John started a fight with the local bully. It is here, that Edna believes that John is her long lost child. Soon the Tramp get into trouble too, as agents of the law figure out that the kid isn't his own and try to send the boy to an orphanage. That scene alone will get you emotional. The Tramp now has to try to find a way to keep his only love from being taken away, not only by the law, but the mother wanting to see him. The movie goes pretty good until \"Dreamland,\" sequence with angels in residence and devilish interlopers with temptation arrives in the form of 12-year old Lita Grey, whom Chaplin would marry and bitterly divorce in real life (Grey was the source of inspiration for Vladimir Nabakov's \"Lolita\"). That is where it lost focus a bit. I didn't like the ending as well. In no way, should John ever be reunion with the mother who abandon him. Jackie Coogan does a great job. It's weird in a way that the actor would end up playing Uncle Fester years later on 1964's Addams Family. There are several version of this. In 1971, Chaplin, who was eager to share his work with a new generation, that he re-cut the picture, resulting in a version that was shorter. I thought the scenes he cut were very good and added a little more depth to the characters. There is a crucial 80-second scene which is missing in that version. The mother goes to a bridge and encounters something which makes her decide that she wants the child after all. Since films and soundtracks are often copyrighted separately at the time, it was hard to find the right song for the film. Chaplin wrote all of the music for his pictures and few survive over the years. The film is still riddled with age related artifacts that, even with this skillful transfer, are still present. Film grain is moderate. Black levels are sometimes weak. The gray scale is adequately balanced. Aliasing, edge enhancement and shimmering of fine details are all present and sometimes distract. The audio is 5.1 and nicely balanced. I couldn't see the lettering in my version. Overall: If you are a Chaplin fan, this movie is a must have.

It's well-known that Chaplin's studio wasn't fond of him going into a feature length film but thankfully he got his way because this is clearly the first masterpiece in a long line of great films. THE KID is a rather remarkable little film and one I'm always fascinated by because it's somewhat hard to believe that Chaplin was able to create such a great film in such a short running time. The film starts off with some wonderfully funny sequences including the one where our Tramp first finds the baby boy. Just take a look at this sequence and not only see how funny it is but also look at some of the black humor. There's one part where the Tramp is sitting with the baby by a drain and he opens the drain and thinks about dropping the baby down it. Another terrific moment is when we get back to the rundown home and see how the Tramp fixes up the kid's bottles. The laughs don't stop here because they get even better as we see how the Tramp and his new son make a living. Of course, the last part of the film contains the drama and man is it very powerful. Everyone knows the famous shot of Coogan on the back of the truck screaming out. This is certainly a very powerful scene but so is the look on Chaplin's face as he realizes that he might be losing his buddy. Both Chaplin and Coogan are perfect in their roles and it's rather amazing to see how much they do come across like a real-life father and on.

We are in the slum from everyday life only now it has transformed into a heavenly eden, with everyone rejoicing and the Tramp strolling around on wings; innocence, joy, it's all as should be or was once, except the devil appears to trick the balance.It is a poignant entry into the world of Chaplin, why he works for some, why he doesn't for others, and it's telling that it happens at the moment of crisis, with the kid snatched from his foster dad and everything looking unsure, holding pain. So, this is the blueprint that is meant to explain the lowest ebb of the life energies; good and evil as clear entities, with a clear division between them and evil as external agent of some whimsical malevolence.The moral lesson that bubbles upwards from the internal vision is mostly trite; the forces of antagonism - on the superficial level they appear as stern moralists or law-makers, officers of a state attempting to control reality - as the agents of some faceless but institutionalized, hence deeply-rooted cruelty, and the benevolent hero on the other side restored into faith by a miraculous chain of events.So, good and evil arise and disappear in equally random, inexplicable flows and ebbs. Nothing governs here, and so the fact that good has the last word fails to convince. It's the magical flight of fancy, which is perhaps the whole point to begin with.But right down to the cosmological bone, I am a Buster Keaton person; the face is a stone mask there, wearily enduring whatever mockery the world or hapless fate throws at him as part of the wondrous slapstick of life.

And if there's one film where Charlie Chaplin's face oddly illuminates the screen, it's definitely \"The Kid\". Sure, many fans would argue that \"City Lights\" is Chaplin's masterpiece but something is too perfect, too masterfully directed, it was made during the talking era, Chaplin was in his 40's and had more experience, while \"The Kid\" features a more youthful director, It belongs to a whole other era, and has the historical feel of a Mark Twain or Charles Dickens novel, which is not surprising when you consider that the movie is chronologically closer to these classics \u0085 Indeed, in 1921, Chaplin was 32, Hitchcock 22, Brando wasn't even born, discovering \"The Kid\" is like turning the pages of a dusty yellow-paged historical book, one eye is watching the film, while the other discovers a period. And I don't know if I'm the only one, but there's something in the setting, the location that makes the film look even older. For all I saw, the movie could have been set in the early century, and considering the timing of the film, maybe this feeling has been deliberately accentuated by Chaplin, himself. The film was made in a difficult personal time, when he'd just lost his son after his birth. There was a great wound in Chaplin's heart and a movie evoking childhood was the best way to exorcise his inner demons, and his discovery of a very young gifted child named Jackie Coogan the perfect encouragement.The context of \"The Kid\" is crucial to analyze and comprehend the personal motives of Chaplin beneath the simple desire to make a movie. Chaplin was a successful comedian at that time, which is even more impressive considering his seven-year experience, a short time but enough to create an icon, the Little Tramp, an immediately recognizable character that put a face in a rather young art named Cinema. Chaplin's story is also the perfect illustration of the American Dream and I'm sure that he felt privileged for having gone from a difficult childhood in a poor London district to Hollywood fame ... and maybe somewhere deeply in his heart, he felt obliged to let this part of himself having an occasion to shine, maybe he knew he was the only one who could direct himself in a more serious tone, and maybe the weight of the past was the little flame that ignited his desire to be a film-maker.\"The Emigrant\" in 1917 was like the first step back into Chaplin's past, inspired by his own experience. The movie doesn't feature many emotional moments probably because the emigration carries a sort of hope for a better future, and leaving the motherland wasn't synonym of sadness, but the emotions were there, beyond the slapstick and the comedy, and waiting for another step back, to finally explode in an emotional firework, which directly transports us to Chaplin's past. He who grew up without a father, and started working at an early age, he who learned entertainment for survival more than for a living, before it cemented his talent, he needed to dedicate a film to what made Chaplin Chaplin. And this is how \"The Kid\" was made, and for the first time, Chaplin would become more than a simple clown, and get all the respect he needed from his peers, as a gifted film-maker. He could finally make his first masterpiece \"The Gold Rush\", but \"The Kid\" was this necessary last breath before taking the big dive.Many aspects of \"The Kid\" highlight Chaplin's past, and the level of pathos depicted in the introduction will disconcert many fans who expected good laughs : a woman abandons a child, expecting him to be adopted by a rich family, until funny yet hazardous circumstances put the child into the Tramp's arms. But what strikes the most is the level of maturity from Chaplin who, despite the archetypal situations, didn't make the gesture as spontaneous as it could have been, the mother of the illegitimate son is obviously devoured by guilt, as is the father, a nice-looking fellow, and a sign that Chaplin doesn't hold any grief against his father. These things happen, and we shouldn't feel sorry, as it contributed to the creation of one of the greatest early cinematic duos : the Tramp and the Kid.In every aspect, the Kid is Chaplin's alter ego : he's smart, tender, funny, sensitive\u0085 and more than anything extremely convincing. We've seen so many child performances since 1921 to get a definitive opinion on what a great one is, and Jackie Coogan is one of the best, if not the best, almost stealing the show from the King of Comedy, and that the kid didn't become as much a star as Chaplin, is one of cinema's cruelest ironies. The chemistry between the two characters is genuinely authentic, and it takes its highlight at one irresistible emotional scene. I surrendered to tears when I saw the poor little kid crying, while the movie showed one of the rarest and most intense close-ups on Chaplin's face : his devastated look and his eyes suggesting an icy blueness as to incarnate the cold cruelty of a world that would allow the worst to happen, and whatever inhabits the Tramp's heart is communicated through an emotional score composed by Chaplin himself.Chaplin, like Disney for animation, handled drama with the same strength as for comedy, the necessary tears for a movie mostly made of joy, fun, cheers, and even some dreamy escapism allowing a self-reflexive approach of the magic of childhood. \"The Kid\" is not perfect, but it's a masterpiece of sincerity, of humanity that only Chaplin could have made and embodied through a magnificent music.

The film tells the tale of a woman who abandons her infant son, who is eventually stumbled upon by the famous Little Tramp character, played by Chaplin. The Tramp takes the baby into his own care. Five years go by, and the Tramp and the Kid, portrayed by a young Jackie Coogan, are getting along just fine. However, a turn of events results in the two being separated, and from there the film moves on as the Tramp desperately tries to be reunited with the boy he has grown to consider his son.Charlie Chaplin is a true master of filmmaking, and this film is one of his best. His direction is truly remarkable, being able to manipulate the audience's emotions so much without sound. He is able to do more with silence than any living filmmaker could do with an insurmountable budget. He manages to make you laugh almost non-stop from start to finish, and even wind up causing you to shed a tear. It's so emotionally gripping, and you just fall in love with these characters from the get-go. Even though the Tramp may not have the best living conditions or resources to properly care for the Kid, his love and loyalty to his job of caring for the boy makes their relationship a truly beautiful piece of cinema.As emotionally wrenching this film is, it's simply hilarious. This film has some great slapstick humor, and Chaplin is a true master of it. Jackie Coogan is also great. If I had to find one flaw with the film, it would be the slightly odd and silly dream sequence, but it is symbolic of the rest of the film and I don't really mind it, despite being odd and out of tone with the rest of the film. Overall, The Kid is a film that can make you laugh out loud one minute, then tug at your heartstrings the next. It's an absolute riot, but one of the most emotionally satisfying pieces of cinema I've ever seen. And to think that Chaplin did all this without a line of dialogue, it's just incredible.

However, having spent nearly two years on a production which resulted in a completed film of six reels, it must have appeared inevitable that the comedian had made himself worthy of another evaluation. Chaplin's first feature film as a director is presented as \"A film with a laugh \u2013 and perhaps a tear\" in an opening title, and this promise is being kept throughout; quite definitely so. The film has the Tramp finding an abandoned baby, whom he eventually adopts. As a few years go by, the two of them struggle to make both ends meet, and they are forced to use some quite imaginative methods in order to survive: a brilliant sequence has the Kid breaking windows while the Tramp casually walks by as a glazier\u0085 Obviously, they are frequently in trouble with the law, and the Tramp might not come across as an overwhelmingly ideal parent; at least not at first sight. However, eventually a visit from a representative of a children's home put to question who is really capable of giving the Kid love and affection when he needs it the most\u0085Having started out his film career doing pretty much what most of his contemporaries were doing at the time (running around and knocking down a by-passer with a brick in the head simply because he looks kind of stupid), Chaplin had undergone a truly phenomenal artistic development during his first seven years as a film-maker. Although his talent had been evident from the very start, and he had several outstanding short comedies on his credit by this time, THE KID is probably the film where his ability to convey a strong dramatic aspect within his comedy reached full maturity. The chemistry between Chaplin and child actor marvel Jackie Coogan is not only touching, but appears to be truly genuine; it actually started a trend of adopting abandoned children among film comedians for the years to follow, of which Lloyd Hamilton is one example. However, one of the reasons why Chaplin's version remains so much alive in public consciousness to this day, while most attempts at imitating him are forgotten, is that the comedian based his story on truly personal experiences and concerns. Although being far from the first time he looked back upon his tough past as a poverty-struck boy in London in order to find a setting for his films, he had never before dared to let the pain which he suffered during much of his childhood become so visibly reflected. His memory of being taken away from his mother by cold authorities as a child is an unavoidable parallel, and it has also been suggested that the film may partly reflect Chaplin's sorrow over having lost an infant child at the beginning of the production.It is true, as some contemporary critics have noted, that the film does make use some of time-typical elements which might appear dated today, such as a few scenes with the mother and certain title-cards. The structure of the film appears more predictable in some regards than later productions of Chaplin such as THE GOLD RUSH and CITY LIGHTS. However, it would be quite pointless (and unfair) to expect THE KID not to have been affected by the time during which it was made. In the years that followed, the silent film language would reach perfection, as directors both in Hollywood and the rest of the world developed ground-breaking methods to convey depth and complexity through subtle nuances. Although I believe he is not generally given the credit he deserves, Chaplin's contributions to this progression stand as incomparable in several ways. With THE KID, he set a whole new standard as to what level the genre of film comedy could be stretched. Although Roscoe Arbuckle, Mabel Normand, Mary Pickford and Max Linder had appeared in features already (which had resulted in some fine comedies, indeed), Chaplin's ability to evoke genuine concern for the Tramp and the Kid left an impact which is evident not only in the later features of other great silent comedians such as Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd and Harry Langdon, but remains visible to this day. Chaplin reached an emotional level which interacted smoothly with the comedy, forcing us to wipe our eyes even though we laughed ourselves silly some five minutes earlier.

It isn't just length. After all, some of Charlie Chaplin's later shorts were as long as forty-five minutes, while The Kid is barely an hour. No, when Chaplin made his graduation to full-length features, he also strove to broaden the scope, scale and above all the dignity of his work. The Kid is not just the addition of another fifteen minutes of funny business; it is truly a turning point in Chaplin's career.The Kid begins with a bit of backstory, as a few of Chaplin's shorts do, but never before has he conceived one as professional looking as this. Here we have the opening of a drama, and yet one written and staged with such simplicity that it does not overbalance the rest of the picture, and does not leave us waiting too long to get onto the comedy. Two shots and a title card tell us that the woman in this story is the mother of an illegitimate child. A couple more shots tell us that the father is now out of her life, and revealing him to be an aspiring artist gives us an idea of why she may have been attracted to him, and why perhaps their relationship was passionate yet brief. Of course, such seriousness was the sort of thing to be lampooned in a Chaplin short, but here that wouldn't be appropriate. Instead we are eased gradually into the comedy world, but having the pair of hoodlums who steal the car slightly buffoonish characters \u2013 they are by no means laugh-out-loud funny, but they certainly don't belong in a straight dramatic setting. And throughout while the drama remains very genuine Chaplin takes care never to allow any environment to become too serious, for example having Henry Bergman turn up as a flamboyant impresario in the dressing room scene.And never before has the effort gone into directing actors been so evident in a Chaplin picture. The performances in The Kid are full of subtle gesture and timing in ensemble pieces. Edna Purviance demonstrates a good sense of dramatic realism, with a little too much melodramatic exaggeration, but still very natural by the standards of the time. And of course, little Jackie Coogan is astoundingly impressive, his movements, expressions and timings all spot-on, so much so that it almost looks impossible for a child to be acting with such apparent awareness, and he appears more like a human cartoon character. Coogan steals the picture with ease, and for once the normally egotistical Chaplin steps graciously aside.This too is an important difference with The Kid. Chaplin had always resisted anything verging on a double act, famously severing his partnership with the funny-in-his-own-right Ben Turpin back in 1915. Now however he allows his rapport with Coogan to become the main basis for gags. Notice how there are very few protracted comedy sequences in The Kid that feature Chaplin on his own. The few examples, such as the routine with the policeman's wife and the window ledge, are often hilarious and Chaplin could easily have filled the picture with such material. However, he does the bulk of the comedy in duet with Coogan, in material which is perhaps not quite as funny but also has that endearing touch to it, and Chaplin willingly sacrifices his own time in the limelight to bring this out.Today The Kid can be looked upon as the ancestor of the successful feature-length spin-off. If you look at something like the 80-minute Christmas special of The Office, it similarly broadened out the scope of the TV series by adding some serious dramatic and emotional elements, and has become recognised as a masterpiece \u2013 better than the series. By comparison The Simpsons will always be best remembered as a TV show because The Simpsons Movie just felt like an extra long episode. Chaplin's full length features however were far more than just spin-offs, and have always been revered and regarded as the most important body of his work.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 12, "votes": 13}, "heading": "\"Proper care and attention\"", "date": "2010-08-21T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2298741"}, {"content": "While I don't consider The Kid Charlie Chaplin's best, along with Limelight it is his most charming and most touching film.

Basically The Woman, or Edna (Edna Purviance) comes out of the charity hospital, carrying her new born baby, which she places in a limousine with a pleading note, and she runs away to commit suicide, which she does not go through with. The limousine is stolen by two crooks who find the baby, and dump it in a garbage can, where he is found by passing Tramp, or Charlie (Sir Charlie Chaplin). The Tramp cares for the Kid, or John (Jackie Coogan, who grew up to be Uncle Fester in The Addams Family, 1960's TV show) for five years, and in that time Edna has become an opera star doing charity work for poor children, hoping to find her son. The Kid is The Tramp's partner in crime, breaking people's windows so that Charlie can put a new piece of glass in and get money from it. A doctor comes round to see the Kid when he is sick, and he is shocked to see the note left when he was a baby, he says he will get the Orphan Asylum men to come and get him. This note is passed to Edna, who realises they have found her little boy, and the Tramp manages to save the Kid before he gets to the Asylum. The Kid is taken away again, and after a quick dream involving angels and stuff, The Tramp wakes to be taken to Edna and the Kid where they all unite at her mansion.

His character, the Tramp, is now a cultural icon and will forever be a symbol of poverty and travesty that was American society in the early 20th century, but something all of us can overcome.In one of his first roles with this character, he played opposite a very young Jackie Coogan, who would go on to play Uncle Fester in the cult TV series The Addams Family. Taking himself and this very talented young boy, Chaplin made a masterwork; one that he truly could call his own as he wrote, directed, starred in and composed the score for this film.Here, Chaplin feeds to one of the most basic of all human desires: to care for a child and be needed and loved by one another. The Tramp finds an abandoned baby in an alley and in order to not be caught by a policeman he takes the child in as his own. He hasn't got much but he does have love, which is more than can be said for the child's mother.Flash forward five years, and now the mother wants her son back. Circumstances arise and soon the Tramp is fighting for the right to keep his little companion. Even so, the story is thin but I believe Chaplin was going for something more deep and meaningful. This also gave him a chance to work on some different visual styles and comedic gimmicks, things not used much at the time in the movies. Using these little tricks and ideas, Chaplin creates a real persona not just for himself but also the supporting cast and involving us in the story.However, at the heart of the story are the emotions about fighting for the right to be a parent/guardian; someone the kid can look up to and sleep beside and confide in. It tugs at your heart all while making you laugh, sometimes in the same scene. This shows the work of a true genius; someone who knew what he wanted to create and the style in which he wanted to portray it.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 26, "votes": 29}, "heading": "A picture with laughter and a few tears, indeed.", "date": "2010-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2184269"}, {"content": "The simple, lovely story of an abandoned kid and found and raised by the little tramp is executed by Chaplin with an incredible sensitive touch.

You wouldn't ever see Charlie Chaplin doing a silent horror film, or at least one like out of Germany, or even a big epic that ran Griffith lengths. His artistry was concerned with those who could just about afford the price of a ticket back in the 20s and 30s to see his films and he combined pathos that was incredible and unique in and of its spectrum of humor and compassion. Some may call films like the Kid and even City Lights sentimental, but they may miss the greater picture at work which is that any sentiment is orchestrated and (the usual kicked-around word) manipulated amid the comedic set-ups. Earned sentiment is different than faux sentimentality chucked on to the viewer, and if any case could show this distinction better it would be hard to find a better example then the Kid.As it stands even at 50 minutes, which was trimmed by Chaplin himself 50 years after its original release and including a new musical score, it's just about a perfectly told tale. It is short in either cut form but its so simple a story to tell that anything else would just likely be padding; even that 'Dreamland' sequence towards the end of the film is crucial and allows for Chaplin to let loose on a wonderful light-and-dark examination of all the major characters in the picture- now with angel wings and devil horns! What it's about, in complete basics, is that a woman leaves her baby in the backseat of a car thinking she won't be able to take care of him, and the baby winds up by chance in an alleyway the Tramp is at, and the Tramp decides to take care of him (he even names him, in one amusing aside, John). Then it cuts to 5 years later, and the two are an intrepid duo as they break and fix windows, eat lots of pancake, and the Tramp nearly gets pummeled by an \"Older Brother\" of a kid John gets in a fight with. Meanwhile, the mother is now a success, not knowing her child is somewhere- right in front of her nose.This may sound like a bit of story, but it's told briskly and without a missed beat in editing, and Chaplin's re-edit tightens it to a point where we're mostly with the Kid and the Tramp. Their scenes are everything that Chaplin wants them to be: playful, absurd, cute, and bittersweet to a degree. We know this can't exactly last, but the moment the poor maybe-sick Kid is taken away to the orphanage becomes one of the most tragic (and yet partially triumphant) sequences in the movies. It's in a case like this, where we as the audience tear up, more or less, as the Kid is being carted away crying his eyes out, and then inter-cut with Chaplin's daring dash across the roof-tops to save him, that we see the genius of comedy and tragedy combined and working off each other. This is assisted greatly throughout by child actor Jackie Coogan who may be one of the very best child actors in any film, silent or otherwise; that it's silent adds to the challenge and success of pure pantomime that without fault feels true: even a beat with the Kid playing with toys, an obviously \"cute\" bit, is great, and up for the task of playing off a quintessential clown like Chaplin.Featuring some excellent set-pieces just unto themselves (aside from Dreamland there is the fight between Chaplin and the Brother with that belly-laugh part with the repetitive brick-hit to the head, or when Tramp and the Kid stop to sleep for the night at the home and have to sneak around to try and not pay an extra coin), an absolutely beautiful musical track from Chaplin, and excellent performances from all supporting cast (including frequent Chaplin star Edna Purvivance), it's altogether an awe-inspiring feat.

Though his parents, both music hall entertainers, separated before his third birthday, they also raised him into the entertainment business. His first appearance on film was in 'Making a Living (1914),' a one-reel comedy released on February 2, 1914. It didn't take long for Chaplin to find his niche in the film-making industry, and his character of the Tramp \u0096 who first appeared in 'Kid Auto Races at Venice (1914)' \u0096 guaranteed his popularity and longevity in the industry. After a string of successful short films, among the most accomplished of which are 'Shoulder Arms (1918)' and 'A Dog's Life (1918),' Chaplin commenced production on his first feature-length outing with the Tramp. 'The Kid (1921)' proved an instant success, becoming the second highest-grossing film of 1921 {behind Rex Ingram's 'The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse (1921)'} and ensuring another fifteen years of comedies featuring Chaplin's most enduring character.'The Kid' opens in somewhat sombre circumstances, as a struggling entertainer (Chaplin regular Edna Purviance) emerges from the hospital clasping her unwanted child. Unable, or perhaps unwilling, to care for the infant, she regretfully abandons the baby in an automobile, which is promptly hijacked by unscrupulous criminals. The car thieves discard the orphan in a garbage-strewn alleyway, at which point our humble vagrant hero comes tramping down the street. Upon his discovery of the little bundle-of-joy, Chaplin demonstrates the most practical response, and glances inquiringly upwards, both at the apartment windows through which residents like to toss their leftovers, and at the Heavens, who conceivably might have dropped a newborn from the sky. After several awkward attempts to unload the baby on somebody else, Chaplin lovingly decides to raise the kid himself, crudely fashioning the necessities of child-raising (a milk bottle, a toilet seat) from his own modest possessions. Five years on, the Kid (Jackie Coogan) has blossomed into a devoted and energetic sidekick, a partner-in-crime if you will, and it is then that Chaplin's fatherhood is placed in jeopardy.The Tramp's young co-star was the son of an actor, and Chaplin first discovered him during a vaudeville performance, when the four-year-old entertained audiences with the \"shimmy,\" a popular dance at the time. Chaplin was delighted with Coogan's natural talent for mimicry, and his ability to precisely impersonate the Tramp's unique expressions and mannerisms \u0096 becoming, in effect, a childhood version of Chaplin \u0096 was crucial to the film's success. The domestic bond exhibited by the pair is faultless in every regard, and, adding to the poignancy of their relationship, Chaplin began work on the production just days after the death of his own three-day-old newborn son, Norman Spencer Chaplin (during his short-lived marriage to child actor Mildred Harris). The mutual compassion and understanding underlying the central father-son relationship remains very touching nearly ninety years later, particularly when the pair employ their combined talents to promote the continued prolificacy of the Tramp's window-repair business. However, even during proceedings as ordinary as a pancake breakfast, that the two share a genuine affection for one another is beyond question.According to Chaplin's autobiography, actor Jack Coogan, Sr (who plays several minor roles throughout the film, including the troublesome Devil in the dream sequence) told his young son that, if he couldn't cry convincingly, he'd be sent to a workhouse for real. We can never know for certain if this was the case, but what we do know is that, during the separation sequence, young Coogan delivers one of the most heart-wrenching child performances ever committed to the screen, his hands stretched outwards in a grief-stricken plea for mercy. His performance is intercut with Chaplin grappling frantically with the authorities, his widened eyes staring directly at the camera, as though actively pleading for the audience's sympathy and assistance; it's one of the director's all-time most unforgettable moments, and first decisive instance that Chaplin was able to so seamlessly blend humour and pathos. In the 1970s, Chaplin \u0096 ever the perfectionist \u0096 re-released the film with a newly-composed score, and deleted three additional sequences involving Purviance as the orphan's mother, which might explain why the kid's father (Carl Miller) apparently serves no use to the story.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 4}, "heading": "The Tramp goes feature-length", "date": "2008-06-28T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1901091"}, {"content": "Charlie Chaplin's first full length feature film, and his biggest success up to that date, is a remarkably heartwarming story , which makes the surprising connection between slapstick comedy and dramatic tragedy. It begins with a woman who's \"sin was motherhood,\" who gives birth to a baby she can't support at a Charity Hospital which is kept pad-locked from the inside. She is forced to abandon it in an alley, and before long Chaplin wanders by and what follows is one of the best sequences of the film, as he is casually strolling by and then, through a series of odd but entirely believable situations, he is unable to get rid of it. It is no secret that little Jackie Coogan nearly stole the show from Chaplin (who was in top form) playing the little boy at 5 years old. Charlie's life is thrown into turmoil by the unexpected arrival of the baby, but eventually he sort of organizes his life and when the kid gets a little older they make a nice living together, the boy breaking windows and Charlie selling replacements. Soon the police notice so they have to cut and run, because there are other conflicts approaching which will warrant screen time much more than how they make money. It is interesting to watch the film oscillate back and forth from Chaplin's traditional slapstick comedy and a much more developed, dramatic story. The film is interspersed with pure slapstick and some genuinely moving moments (sometimes simultaneously, if you can believe that), but overall it is a truly heartwarming tale of friendship and family and survival, and it is never once predictable, all the way until the last frame.There is a quick scene where the kid gets into a fist fight with another little boy, and in between \"rounds, \" Charlie is rubbing the kid down and congratulating him on fighting so well, and giving him hints for the rest of the fight. Meanwhile, the other kid's brother shows up, a massive oaf of a man who looks more like Frankenstein's monster than anything else. What follows is a pretty funny fight that looks startlingly similar to the fight between Charlie and the town bully in Easy Street. This is a slapstick set-up that is so simple that it could have been thrown in just to take up screen time, were it not for it's direct relevance to the story.At another point, there is pure slapstick taking place in their little shack of a home, as the 1921 version of Child Protective Services shows up to tear the young boy crying from Jackie's arms. I think this is the only time in any film that I've ever seen genuine, low-brow slapstick so seamlessly combined with a truly sad and heartbreaking incident. This combination, not just here but throughout the film, is The Kid's biggest achievement. There is a dream sequence near the end of the film that I am really not sure what to think about, although my understanding is that volumes have been written about it's symbolic meaning, both within the movie and in reference to Chaplin's personal life. And speaking of which, supposedly there were some legal issues involving money and divorce for which Chaplin sped the film stock to Utah for editing. I don't know which story to believe, that it was because of Chaplin's painful divorce or because he was unhappy with his salary (I would bet it's a little of both), but the film is here and I guess ultimately that's all that matters. In the five or six times that I've seen The Kid, I am always a little uncomfortable with that kiss that Charlie gives the kid when he finally rescues him from the back of that truck, if only because I am conscious that he is not the tramp's real son, either on screen or off. Then again, I am looking at it with 21st century eyes. Some of Shirley Temple's early films are also a little disturbing to me, although for not quite the same reasons. By this time, Chaplin was fully on the road to his career in full length feature films, and after 36 short comedies for Mack Sennett at Keystone Studios and a dozen or so more for Essanay and Vagabond (along with a few assorted others), Charlie was fast on the way to establishing himself as one of the greatest stars in the history of the cinema.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 12, "votes": 15}, "heading": "\"A picture with a smile \u0096 and perhaps, a tear.\"", "date": "2008-04-27T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1864477"}, {"content": "Due to an unwed mother abandoning her child in an automobile and said automobile being subsequently hijacked, The Little Tramp winds up with the baby and proceeds to raise it in its first five years.In reading Charlie Chaplin's memoirs I learned two things about the making of The Kid.

The second thing was Chaplin's determination to make a film that combined both pathos and comedy which many said could not be done.The success of The Kid is due to the chemistry established between Chaplin and Coogan. As Chaplin said in his memoirs young children in their uninhibited way are natural actors. Part of the chemistry though is to make sure they don't totally steal the film from you.The Tramp gets his innings in with The Kid.

You grow to care about what happens to them, which is one of the things that makes the later parts of the film so interesting.The story uses elements of comedy and drama, and succeeds in both categories. The comedy aspects are still very effective today. Any of the fight scenes are exciting and well- planned. The dreamland sequence towards the end is pure genius. The drama aspects are also still fresh. Its probably the most emotionally touching film of its time.

Why? Maybe physical comedy has the same kind of effect on me as a dance performance. Both art forms are very expressive; the fact that I'm laughing doesn't dilute the emotional charge.One of many things that made Chaplin a genius was his understanding of how close slapstick is to pathos already. Why not marry the two things? That's what he did in some of his early short films, and that's what he does in this feature comedy. The Little Tramp finds an abandoned baby and raises him into boyhood. But the authorities find out and want to take little Jackie (Jackie Coogan) away. Meanwhile, the mother who abandoned him has since become a wealthy singer and doesn't know if she'll ever find out what became of him.Jackie Coogan (about five in this film), with his charming manners, his talents as a mimic and his adeptness at physical comedy, is one of the all-time great child actors. Want more evidence of Chaplin's genius? Coogan doesn't steal the film from him. This is true even though Chaplin, as producer, star and director, makes every evident attempt to spotlight the boy's talents. Coogan is even better here than he is in his own vehicles, like \"My Boy\" and \"Oliver Twist.\"Chaplin's storytelling\u2014even with the foolish sub-Dickensian plot twists, such as Jackie suddenly taking ill\u2014deftly draws out the comedy and pathos for maximum effect. The individual scenes themselves are flawlessly constructed. The window-breaking scene, the flophouse scene, the dream sequence, the trying-to-get-rid-of-the-baby scene\u2014they're perfect. Chaplin's celebrated pantomimic skills are examples of storytelling in themselves.Want me to criticize something? How about those thudding attempts to link the mother with Jesus?

And the movie as a whole is too good to allow us to sneer at the (very) few flaws.One important note: children love this movie.

And it has little Jackie Coogan, the first full-fledged, honest-to-god child star. And what an absolutely great film it is. Every moment of this one was just wonderful. You can tell that this film meant a lot to Chaplin emotionally. And Coogan is just as cute as can be, even when he's throwing rocks at windows with his tiny arms. Another thing I noticed was that the title cards in this film were much simpler and to-the-point, unlike the cards in Griffith's films, which were always very poetic and biblical-sounding, even in Broken Blossoms, where things were as far from epic as they could be. I must also say that the DVD restoration on this film is astonishing. It literally looks brand new, like it was shot yesterday.DOUG: In 1921, silent filmmaker extraordinaire Charles Chaplin (Charlie to his fans) released his first full-length motion picture (what passed for full length in those days at 6 reels and 50 minutes), The Kid. Let me first say that the DVD restoration for this film is excellent. It looks like it was shot yesterday. You can make out every window on the buildings, every leaf on the trees. I imagine this has something to do with the fact that the film was re-edited and re-released in 1971. I do kind of wish we had checked out some of Chaplin's earlier short work leading up to this, but we still have plenty more of the Tramp to go. This film was wonderful. Jackie Coogan is simply adorable as the title character, a perfect sidekick for the Tramp. Of course the big moment in the movie is when the workers come to take the kid away to a workhouse, and the Tramp ferociously fights back and reclaims him before they can cart him away. This is an intense moment in a very light and comedic film, no doubt with roots to Chaplin's own childhood. In Intolerance we also saw workers taking a child away against a parent's will, so I wonder if this was an issue in the 10's and 20's, this thing of taking young children away from parents who were deemed \"unfit,\" to give them a \"better home.\" We're rooting for the parents all the time; \"All I know is that some strange men came into my house, asked me a lot of weird questions, and then tried to take my son away!\" And hey, we get to see a glimpse of young Lita Grey, who will become important to Chaplin later...Last film viewed: Way Down East (1920).

Simple, subtle and straightforward, Chaplin succeeds both as an actor and a director. As an actor, he plays his usual role of Charlot, a goofy flat-feet-ed short man with a hat and a mustache, who, in this case, finds a baby on the street and decides to raise him. As a director, Chaplin manages to employ a quite \"cinematic\" style, quite contrary to many of his former movies. Because cinematic art, generally speaking, is composed of two major elements: the narrator's ability to choose his focus and the film's reliance on visual rather than verbal information. This film excels in both. Not only is it purely visual, but the manner in which Chaplin places his camera highlights the characters and helps narrate this unornamented tale of parental love. It is highly emotional yet it never crosses the line to melodramatic. It is capable of producing a great deal of through to the viewer yet its subdued themes and messages are never overstated, they never become clear and evident, they sort of come out through the laughter and the tears.

Chaplin was more than just a master of pratfalls- he was an amazingly skilled director with a keen awareness of broader social areas. This is apparent in his sympathetic treatment of Edna Purviance's character, the unmarried single mother of Coogan who is forced to abandon the child as she does not possess the adequate financial resources to raise him with. Purviance, Chaplin's regular leading lady in his numerous comedy shorts, provides a warm and engaging performance as the woman, now wealthy, who regrets having given up her child.Coogan is absolutely amazing and lights up every scene, almost stealing the picture from Chaplin. Chaplin appears not to be too overly concerned with this, as he looks to be in complete appreciative awe of his young co-star's precocious abilities throughout.This is an incredibly moving Chaplin film with one of the Tramp's most emotive performances. Chaplin also provides a beautiful moment for early silent cinema in his creation of the dream sequence near the mind of the picture. It is beautiful, daring scene that must have taken quite a bit of time and skill to set up. Keep an eye out for Lita Grey (Chaplin's future girl-wife)as the tempting Flirtatious Angel in these scenes. Lita Grey apparently was the inspiration for the seductive Lolita in Nabokov's famous novel. I also appreciated the heart-shaped camera dissolves that are employed a few times.

He hadn't filled a film so fully with pathos since \"The Vagabond\" (1916), and then it was in a very limited way--subject to the confines of two reels. And, \"Sunnyside\" (1919) was a failure. The feature length of \"The Kid\" also allows Chaplin to elaborate and refine the gags, pranks and set pieces, and with the support of Jackie Coogan, it's one of his funniest comedies.The parent-child relationship has proved potential as sentimental entertainment, and, for me, not many have neared Chaplin's exploitation of that formula in \"The Kid\". The sequence where they take the kid, for a workhouse, away from the Tramp is probably the most powerful and endearing tearjerker moment in the film--or maybe of all film. In addition to Chaplin and Coogan, Edna Purviance is also quite effective in the dramatic side of the picture. Furthermore, Chaplin and cinematographer Roland Totheroh's photography had by then improved vastly over their work at Mutual, and Chaplin was already an eccentric perfectionist, but the musical score added to the 1971 release, composed by Chaplin, taken from Tchaikovsky, gives the sentimental parts its most verve.Of the slapstick, one of my favorite scenes involves the Tramp in fear of a bully. It's reminiscent of his Mutual short \"Easy Street\" (1917), which is made especially clear when the bully bends a lamppost with one punch. There are many other great moments of humorous pantomime and farce in this film. Yet, \"The Kid\" is much more than that, which makes it such a breakthrough; the slapstick fills the plot, and there is more of a developed plot here than in Chaplin's previous work. This was the beginning of the Tramp as the sympathetic, pitiful hero, as well as clown, that's so recognizable and beloved to this day.Moreover, the dream sequence is an ingenious plot device; it adds dimensionally to the narrative and asserts its themes while delaying the inevitable conclusion of the outer narrative to poignant effect. It's also funny in a silly way. It's somewhat analogous to the outer reality story, although with much ambiguity. I wasn't always sure Chaplin was making any clear point, such as with the Christ image earlier in the film, but that seems unimportant; \"The Kid\" affects the emotions and isn't especially aimed at engaging the mind. At six reels, with more sets and a developed plot, this film was already an expansion compared to Chaplin's previous work; the dream sequence satisfyingly expands the narrative depth, thus making \"The Kid\" Chaplin's first complete feature.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 32, "votes": 34}, "heading": "Smiling and Tearing", "date": "2005-08-29T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1160671"}, {"content": "One of Chaplin's best.

Aside from Chaplin cast opposite Marie Dressler in TILLIE'S PUNCTURED ROMANCE (1914), a Mack Sennett production hailed as the first feature length comedy, THE KID starts Chaplin with a whole new cycle of feature comedies, but releases coming once every two to three years. A comic genius who got his start in comedy shorts starting in 1914, eventually under the supervision and direction of himself, Chaplin's methods in movie making improved with each passing film. Like himself, Jackie Coogan, Chaplin's littlest co-star and title character, made such an impression with his initial performance, nearly upstaging his impresario, that he immediately found himself starring in movies on his own, becoming Hollywood's first important child star.THE KID starts off with inter-titles, \"A picture with a smile and perhaps a tear,\" followed by \"The woman whose sin was motherhood,\" titles much to the liking of a D.W. Griffith directorial tearjerker starring Lillian Gish, yet, in fact, might have seemed more logical for a Griffith film than Chaplin's, whose very name personifies comedy. A young girl (Edna Purviance) leaves a charity hospital with a baby in her arms. who turns out to be an unwed mother whose father (Carl Miller), a young artist, never returns to her life. The mother places her baby in the back of a limousine and walks away. Crooks enter the scene, stealing the car, discover the baby and place it in a trash bin in the poor district of town. Noticing the infant wrapped in a blanket, Charlie tries to pass it off to someone else, but after stumbling upon a note which reads, \"Please love and care for this orphan child,\" he decides to raise the child himself. Five years pass. The kid (whose name is believed to be John), now Charlie's adopted son and sidekick, start off each day with brand new adventures in raising money. As for the kid's mother, she's become \"a star of great prominence,\" devoting her spare time with charitable work handing out gifts to the children of poor districts, where lives the kid. The paths of the kid and his mother meet on numerous occasions, unaware of each other's identities. When the kid becomes seriously ill and in need of immediate medical attention, a middle-aged country doctor, having discovered Charlie not the boy's true father, sends for the authorities from the County Orphan Asylum to take the child away.THE KID consists of many ingredients to make this an everlasting product, especially for a silent movie made so long ago. Chaplin, who constructs his gags to perfection, has one difficult scene that comes off naturally, this being where Charlie cuts out diapers from a sheet for the infant as he's lying beside him in a miniature hammock crying out for his milk. The baby immediately stops after Charlie directs the nipple attached to a coffee pot (a substitute for a baby bottle) back into his mouth. Another classic moment, on a serious nature, is when Charlie is being held back by authorities, being forced to watch his crying \"son\" taken away from him. Charlie breaks away and goes after the truck as he's being chased by a policeman from the slanted roof-tops. The close-up where father and son tearful reunite is as touching as anything ever captured on film.Chaplin and little Jackie (billed Jack Coogan in the opening credits) display their talents as both funny characters and dramatic actors. Little Jackie is especially cute as a miniature sized Chaplin, right down to his baggy pants. Chaplin giving one of his most sensitive performances, is so convincing that it doesn't take away his screen persona as the lovable funny tramp. From this point onward, he would become less characteristic as a slapstick comedian and more agreeable as an serious actor, at the same time, adding more plot, pathos and truly great comedy routines.As much as the present showing of THE KID barely reaches the one hour mark, Chaplin includes enough gags and pathos to make it work. The dream sequence where he finds himself in Heaven surrounded by angels might appear trite and unnecessary for some, but actually makes it essential to the plot which fits into the scene that follows.THE KID, which had been unavailable for public viewing for many years, was resurrected in the 1970s in revival movie houses with a brand new and wonderful orchestral score conducted by Chaplin himself in 1971. It would be nearly another decade for many to fully get to see and appreciate this little masterpiece when distributed to video cassette in 1989 as part of the Charlie Chaplin centennial collection, double billed along with a comedy short, THE IDLE CLASS (1921). In the DVD format, the two disc set includes rare out-takes and deleted scenes. Turner Classic Movies has brought forth THE KID as part of its movie library, where it made its debut December 15, 2003, during its weekly Silent Sunday Nights, hosted by Robert Osborne, and later in March 2004 when Charlie Chaplin was selected as its \"Star of the Month.\"For its age, THE KID holds up extremely well, thanks to the convincing performances of both Chaplin and Coogan. There's no doubt Jackie Coogan (1914-1984) became an overnight star with this one film. He was a natural. While the paths of Chaplin and Coogan would never meet again, on screen anyway, without them, there would never have been such a true classic from the silent screen era as THE KID.

Its a milestone in film history as the first example of a silent comedy feature integrating drama and pathos into the comedy. Jackie Coogan gives a great performance in the title role almost as a miniature Tramp which is probably what Charlie meant all along. The Kid and the tramp are two of a kind, just as Charlie was a child performer too, a clog dancer with the Eight Lancashire Lads. In many ways this is Chaplin's most personal work almost re-enacting episodes of his own poverty stricken childhood of the 1890s. The only disappointing sequence is the Tramp's dream of heaven which seems a bit irrelevant but does look pretty. The version I prefer is Chaplin's 52 minute reissue. I've seen the scenes cut from the 67 minute version on a Public Domain DVD, they don't really add anything to the film and are rather over-sentimental.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Shortened version best", "date": "2004-09-24T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0002511"}, {"content": "This was yet another dull and pointless Charlie Chaplin movie. His antics as usual consist of getting hit in the head, doing exaggerated pantomime (sp?), and running around and into various objects. The plot is pretty non-existent but it consists of Chaplin (playing a yet another bum) adopting this orphan kid and the antics that follow. This movie, like pretty much all of Chaplin's work comes off as dated and drags on due to inconsistent plotting. I don't think there is anything that funny about Chaplin's schtick. It might be funny for kids because it plays like a cartoon, but Buster Keaton is vastly superior. Keaton doesn't come off nearly as dated and his movies actually have more of a plot then some poor guy just bumming around. Also his slapstick is more elaborate, creative, and in my opinion memorable. Chaplin benefited heavily at the time because he represented a move away from the rigid Victorian standards of the previous decades, and was a character that a large working class country could identify with. However today he doesn't hold up too well especially when compared with Keaton. Nevertheless if you like this guy then you will probably dismiss what I'm saying and rent or buy (if you're so enclined) this movie. Hopefully though you won't see it, because it sucks. Rent something by Keaton or even the Marx Brothers (if you don't mind talkies) if you are in the mood for a really old comedy, you'll be glad you did.Zoopansick", "rating": 3, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 13, "votes": 76}, "heading": "Chaplin sucking it hardcore again", "date": "2004-06-05T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0002502"}, {"content": "I was hardly a Chaplin fan, in fact, I loved Laurel & Hardy, and really didn't like Charlie Chaplin, until I found that I could impersonate him as a look-a-like.

Instead, the car in which she puts the baby is stolen and The Kid is left abandoned yet again somewhere in the streets.

There has been a generational discontinuity, at least in the USA, that seems to have happened about 20 or 30 years ago. I suspect that most people over the age of 40 could identify Charlie Chaplin, and most people under that age would have to stretch a bit. Just one more item in the cultural data base gurgling its way through the age structure towards extinction.Generally I disapprove of kids in movies as straightforward objects of a particularly putrid kind of manipulation, but Jackie Coogan is an exception.Sentimental manipulation there is, but it's mainly limited to one or two scenes. The comedy is pretty acerbic. Saddled with possession of an abandoned baby, Charlie holds it in his lap and sits on the curb to think about how to get rid of it. He notices a sewer grating in the gutter and lifts the lid thoughtfully for a second before glancing around and lowering it again. That's not what passes for sentimentality.Besides, Coogan is cute when he's 5 or 6 years old, a ragamuffin dressed in floppy over-sized bags of clothing, so that when he runs at high speed he looks like a little football with tiny feet on it. And the kid can act too.Charlie demonstrated every move the kid was supposed to make and Coogan did a good job of imitating him, which was all he had to do. Coogan is also refreshing when compared to all the adult actors in the film because he's too inexperienced to know how to overact. Chaplain is good too, of course. How could one person be so inventive? It's said that TV \"eats up\" talent because of the constant demand for new material. One of the better series, \"Twilight Zone,\" had about three good years of collaborative effort in it. Chaplain in the same period of time appeared in 62 films and directed something like 28 of them, and he was just getting started.I'll give one example of a joke, without an iota of sentiment in it, to illustrate how well Chaplain and Coogan worked together. Coogan gets into a street fight with another kid, a big bully, who knocks him about. Chaplain spots this, interrupts the fight, and takes Coogan to a neutral corner where he gives him a quick lesson on boxing -- go for the belly, keep your guard up -- and sends him back into the fight. At this point the bully's hugely muscular big brother swaggers over to Chaplain and says, \"If your boy beats my boy, I'm going to beat you.\" Coogan begins beating hell out of the other kid, knocking him down again and again while Chaplain sweats and twitches with fear. Finally Coogan lands a tremendous blow on the bully's chin and flattens him. But he swings with such force that he himself twirls around a couple of times and falls flat on his back. Chaplain dashes over, puts his foot on the Coogan's chest to hold him down, quickly counts to ten, rushes to the befuddled bully and raises his hand -- the winner!A rather tight rein is kept on the pathos and the comic material is edgy. You'll enjoy it. Especially if you're one of those rare folks under 40 with the patience to sit through a movie in black and white that has no dialogue.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 9, "votes": 16}, "heading": "Pretty Good Sentimental Comedy", "date": "2004-03-04T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0002508"}, {"content": "Charlie Chaplin's study of a tramp teaming up with a street kid (the cute little Jackie Coogan) has a fine line to tread between humour and pathos, and true to what you would expect of his best work, does it superbly.

Probably not, to different people it's gonna be different person, so I can speak only for myself. Let me try to describe my favorite contestant for this award:\nThis man is the true embodiment of the \"American Dream\": Having grown up in poverty and misery and virtually without parents (without a father and with insane mother), moving to America with basically nothing but his ability to speak English (in the era of the silent movies), this man manages to establish his own film company (United Artists) and becomes one of the creators of Hollywood. He produces, directs, writes, plays the leading role and composes the music for his movies. He is the creator of the most famous movie image on the earth-the Little Tramp. As you all probably know I am talking about sir Charles Spencer Chaplin. There are attempts, sometimes I read, to make Buster Keaton candidate for the Chaplin's throne. Well, I won't comment on that for I am not familiar with Keaton's work; I grew up with Chaplin so you could say I am being biased, however I would mention only one fact here: the only time the two meet on the screen is in a Chaplin's movie \"Limelight.\" I think this says a lot.Why did I choose the movie \"The Kid\" as a podium for my tribute to the great Charlie? I have to say I like all of his movies, mistake, I love all of his movies, but this one is the true purl in his work to me. I don't think of any other movie, not only Chaplin's, that made me cry, I mean really cry, and laugh, I mean really laugh, like \"The Kid.\" The closest I can think of now is another Chaplin's masterpiece \"City Lights\" but unlike the later one in the former one that is only him, the tramp, and the kid; and everything is silent.

Chaplin also wrote a particularly good score for this one, and most of the time the music sets off the action very nicely.While it's a fairly simple story, this is one of Chaplin's most efficiently designed movies. Every scene either is necessary to the plot, or is very funny for its own sake, or both. Except for Chaplin and Coogan, most of the other characters (even frequent Chaplin leading lady Edna Purviance) are just there to advance the plot when needed, and the two leads are allowed to carry the show, which they both do extremely well.\"The Kid\" is also impressive in that, while the story is a sentimental one, it strikes an ideal balance, maintaining sympathy for the characters while never overdoing it with the pathos, which Chaplin occasionally lapsed into even in some of his greatest movies.
