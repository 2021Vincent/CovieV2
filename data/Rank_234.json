Fifty-seven years later it still remains the most incendiary political film of all time. Apparently, before America's invasion of Iraq in 2003, the Pentagon screened THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS, supposedly as an instruction on how not to win over the hearts and minds of the people they're occupying. If that was the purpose, it certainly didn't work, because we all know how that debacle worked out. Contemporary filmmakers such as Spike Lee, Steven Soderbergh, and Oliver Stone appear on the Dvd supplements to explain how much THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS influenced their particular styles.The foundation for THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS lays with a nonfiction account of the Algerian War for Independence written by Saadi Yacef, a former resistance fighter who was released from prison following France's relinquishment of their North African colony in 1962. Almost immediately, Algeria's self-rule government was interested in immortalizing their struggle onto celluloid. Because they had no homegrown filmmaking talent to speak of, they approached Pontocorvo in Italy to see if he wanted to direct.During the Second World War, Pontocorvo was a Marxist member of Italy's Communist party who fought against Mussolini's Fascists. When the war was over, he drifted towards filmmaking, impressed with the neo-realist movement burgeoning in his country. The Algerian government felt that his anti-colonial beliefs, coupled with his flair for docudramas, made him a logical choice to direct THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS.Pontocorvo's screenwriter worked closely with Yacef, who was enjoying a taste of celebrity outside of Algerian due to his involvement with the movie. In addition to the script, Yacef also served as a co-producer and even took on an acting role (as Jafar). Taking a page from Rossellini's BICYCLE THIEVES, Pontocorvo chose to avoid using professional actors in favor of people with no acting experience at all. That included Brahim Haggiag, who played the lead role of Ali LaPointe.Movie watching experience has taught me that, for legal reasons, the names of real-life people whose lives are depicted are given pseudonyms. Or the protagonist is a composite character of more than one person. Therefore, I was quite surprised to learn that Ali LaPointe was, in fact, a real person. The first scene in THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS is in a room where French paratroopers have tortured a prisoner into revealing Ali's hideout. They descend into an apartment where the fugitive is hiding inside a secret room behind a false wall.Unlike the other Allies, France never found peace in the years after the Second World War. Locked into a bitter conflict with the Viet Minh, by 1954 they were on the verge of losing Vietnam (or Indochina), which had been a colonial outpost of theirs for over a century. And now, just across the Mediterranean, the French were being challenged in Algeria by the rebels' National Liberation Front (or FLN), who were seeking the same results as the Viet Minh. What followed was a bloody eight year struggle between France and the FLN over who was going to rule Algeria.After the opening credits, THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS flashes back three years to 1954, where Ali LaPointe is a parolee whose juvenile delinquency has graduated into adult criminal activity. The Algerian capital city is awash with French nationals and expats who bask in humiliating the natives, and when Ali is mercilessly taunted by a young student, he responds by bloodying his tormentor's nose.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Insurrection in the Casbah.", "date": "2023-05-07T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9039936"}, {"content": "If you're looking for a movie that will grab you by the collar and take you on a wild, emotional ride, then The Battle of Algiers is for you. Set during the Algerian War of Independence in the 1950s, the film follows the brutal conflict between the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) and the French government as seen through the eyes of both sides.The Battle of Algiers is a masterful piece of cinema that manages to be both a historical document and a gripping drama. Director Gillo Pontecorvo uses a documentary-style approach to capture the chaos and violence of the war, and the result is a film that feels raw and urgent. The performances are top-notch, particularly from Brahim Haggiag, who plays Ali La Pointe, one of the FLN's most notorious leaders.What's particularly impressive about The Battle of Algiers is how it manages to be both even-handed and emotionally engaging. The film doesn't shy away from the atrocities committed by both sides, but it also never loses sight of the human cost of the conflict. The result is a film that is both thought-provoking and deeply moving.One thing to note is that The Battle of Algiers is not an easy watch. It's a tough, unflinching film that doesn't hold back in its depiction of violence and brutality. But for those willing to take the journey, it's a film that will stick with you long after the credits have rolled.Fun fact: The film was so controversial upon its release that it was banned in France for five years.

Yes, yes ... it sounds like a gross generalization, but true nonetheless.Let me preface by saying I only lasted about 20 minutes on this, so the review will be scant.Here's my breakdown:STORY:\nNo doubt, the telling of a people oppressed by colonization should always be told naked in all\nit's brutality, and perhaps some hope and mercy. This is a difficult-to-watch film for that reason,\nbut not only that.Docudramas are necessary, but they don't have to be told DRY. I'm not asking for the shallow BS\nwe get here in the US the past 20 years. What I'm suggesting is this be told with both accuracy\nand some softer / entertaining features.Take films like \"The Deer Hunter\" (1978) or \"Paths of Glory\" (1957), while they're fictional, they're\nnonetheless built around historical context. They are each brutal and difficult-to-watch, but they\nare filmed and told in ways that allow the viewer to participate (vicariously).Films such as \"Battle for Algiers\" could have, yes, could have been told and filmed with more finesse,\nand thus, more accessible to viewers. Perhaps too, the subtitles don't help.ACTING:\nThe acting is hard to judge, but not so much because I wimped out early. The cast were as dour as can\nbe, which arguably, was necessary. But this is a film, not a funeral.So whether the cast were / are capable and have acting range and character depth is hard to assess.TEMPO:\nLike so many French (European) films I've watched, this is a hectic pace and it doesn't feel at all well edited.CINEMATOGRAPHY:\nPerfect for the context, but almost as dark as deathDIRECTING / WRITING:\nIt's near impossible for me to \"judge,\" but ... I will apply the same rule here as with US directors - don't direct\nstories you write. Some directors are especially gifted and wear both hats brilliantly.

The director spent a good amount of time depicting the violence in the city of Algiers between both the French military and the Algerian National Liberation Army. It shows the tactics and strategies that both sides use to achieve their goal. Each one commits atrocities to each other. After Algerians kill random people in the street, the French retaliate by throwing bombs into random's Algerian's houses and vice versa. The violence just keeps escalating. Given that the city is neatly divided between both Algerian and French, both organizations can easily attack the other side by going to their enemy's neighborhood and randomly attacking them.I was impressed by how soon to the events the movie was made - just a few years after Algeria was independent and the war ended so that made it much more relevant. This movie is something that should be watched by military and foreign policymakers. It shows that you can win a battle but not necessarily the war. This movie is in black and white and plays like a documentary. There is no sugarcoating. The dialogue can be pretty intense, and the hate between protagonists is on full display. Some of the scenes are disturbing as well. There are some moments that just feel the same as events that happened in the last few years. The movie feels new and yet it was made almost 50 years ago.

I recognize the ability to be objective and rigorous in the report made, and it is quite unusual to find a film that resembles both a documentary or a major journalistic report. However, the way it was conceived and its high-contrast cinematography make the experience of watching the film truly tiring.Directed and written by Gillo Pontecorvo, the film addresses, in very broad lines, the effort of the Algerians to resist French colonization and conquer the independence of their country, in one of the most striking colonial conflicts that France faced. However, the way the film approaches the subject could not be worse: instead of building a fictional story on top of historical facts, the narrative is dispersed and, if most of the time we follow in the footsteps of a specific Algerian terrorist, the script proved to be unable to focus on this story and to avoid unreasonable or accessory considerations. Furthermore, and while the film tries to be neutral, the sympathy for the revolutionaries is evident.The cast is satisfactory, but it's made up of names I don't know. Brahim Hadjadj brought to life the most notable character in the film, a member of the Algerian resistance, and was happy in his effort.

One of the lesser known signatories is Jean Martin, an actor who had fought in the French Resistance and served as a paratrooper in Indochina. Putting his name to the Manifesto cost him his job at the Theatre National Populaire.Supremely ironic that six years later he was to be cast by Gillo Pontecorvo as Colonel Mathieu who is assigned the task of crushing Algerian insurgency. Ironic also is the supposed difficulty experienced by the director in toning down Martin's performance so that he would not stand out among the cast of non-professionals.One of the high profile signatories was Jean-Paul Sartre who is cleverly referred to in the film. When Mathieu is asked by a journalist if he likes Sartre he replies: \"Not really, but I like him even less as an opponent\".To the average cinema-goer the length and content of this film are daunting to say the least whereas to those who recognise film as the seventh art it is an undisputed masterpiece. Essential of course to have one's moral compass handy for although Pontecorvo claimed he had made a 'politically neutral' film, as an avowed Marxist there is absolutely no doubt as to where his sympathies lay and its undeniable influence on the tactics of terrorist groups has guaranteed its controversial status.Inspired by the memoirs of Saadi Jacef who appears in the film as an FLN leader, this is shot in a neo-realist, semi-documentary style strongly reminiscent of Rossellini's 'Rome, open City'.Technically it is nigh on faultless with its haunting soundtrack, composition of shots, superb editing and one of Ennio Morricone's most evocative scores.Banned in France for four years, it has been consistently praised by critics, heaped with awards and made a deep impression on directors, notably Stanley Kubrick.Historically of course it has cast an even greater shadow as nations are forced to come to terms with and face the consequences of their colonial past.It must be said however that the world has since seen a seismic shift in attitudes towards politically engendered violence and it is now virtually impossible to justify the unjustifiable.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 4}, "heading": "To win the battle but lose the war.", "date": "2020-10-20T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6191544"}, {"content": "Hyper-realistic depiction of the events leading up to the 1957 'Battle of Algiers', which was fought between FLN (Front de lib\u00e9ration nationale) and elite French airborne troops. The film primarily follows FLN leader Ali La Pointe (Brahim Hadjadj) as he organises terrorist attacks, initially on French police and later on European civilians, and his nemesis Colonel Mathieu (Jean Martin), a composite character representing the French military authority. Although clearly sympathetic to the Algerian separatists, the film is surprisingly even-handed, with neither side refraining from targeting non-combatants. The paratroopers use torture to extract the whereabouts of the FLN leadership while the terrorists enlist women and their children to smuggle bombs out of the Muslim controlled Casbah with which to blow-up 'soft targets' such as Cafes in the European quarter. At times the film is almost a didactic documentary on how to set up a resistance movement and how to fight it (at least at the tactical level). Ironically, the back-story of Mathieu includes serving with the French resistance in WW2, as did one of the real-life men on whom he was based (Marcel \"Bruno\" Bigeard)).

While counting all the historical war films and tales battle of freedom fights in my mind I noticed that most of the films came with excessive use of cinematic liberty and The Battle Of Algiers just changed the entire course of filmmaking in this genre. This film is historically accurate yet dramatic and gives the same chills as fictional stories. The video material involved in this film is sensitive and brutal which makes it highly realistic and mostly authentic. As an audience we feel those situations, those riots, those screams, those explosion, those massacre and the outrage of the people which makes this film more special than any other historical film. It is shot in Black While and the narrative is given a touch of documentary filming and in result of it we enjoy the experience of watching both the streams of cinema, documentary and feature film. It may feel disturbing at several occasions but without all that hard-hitting treatment you will never understand the importance of those events. The major chunk of actors in this film is non-professional yet carries the ride smoothly. Cinematography is brilliant as you can see how it zoom in when needed and how it pans when needed. These are technical things and if you understand them then it's better for you to judge this film. Even after keeping all the historical events realistic and less dramatic, The Battle Of Algiers still manages to give plenty of High cinematic moments where goosebumps are guaranteed. Gillo Pontecorvo's direction is lesson to all the filmmakers that how to make an extraordinary film without losing sense of reality. The way he crafted and presented this revolutionary battle is nothing short of an incredible achievement.

He always took the side of the oppressed. In 1960 he made a film about Jews in a concentration camp (\"Kapo\"), in 1969 he made a fim about a slave revolt (\"Queimada\") and in 1979 he made a film about the oppression of the Basque bij the Franco dictatorship (\"Operacion Ogro\").\"The battle of Algiers\" (1966) is about the colonial war France fought in Algeria from 1954 to 1962. It ended in the indepence of Algeria. The film is situated in a time when the liberation movement of Algeria (FLN) rules the Kasbah and the French army is dominant in the European part of town. There are only a few films about the Algerian war. The only other one I know is \"The day of the jackal\" (1973, Fred Zinnemann) and this film only has an indiect link. The action in this film is set in motion by a part of the French army who is frustrated by the defeat in the Algerian war.\"The battle of Algiers\" has a documentary look and feel. The film was even used as instruction film in military training. As a semi documentary the film gives a nuanced picture of the war. Pontecorvo takes the side of the FLN (the oppressed side) but that does not mean that he is blind for the cruelties they commit. There is a scene in which female solders of the FLN are installing time bombs on a busy place. After they have done their job, their gaze just glides over the crowd. A crowd from which many will be dead in a couple of minutes.The French are led by Colonel Mathieu, a ruthless person who does not shy away for the most horrible forms of torture.

The director is Italian Gillo Pontecorvo and he is also one of the two writers coming up with the script here. This movie uns for minimally over 2 hours and is in black-and-white, which is not a given for mid-60s, but not too unusual either. I think for most of the people working on this film, it is their most famous career effort no matter if behind the camera or in front of it. I will not go into detail about any of the cast members really because I don't know a lot about them if at all, but you know where and how to check them out anyway. Okay as for the movie. I must admit it took me a little while to really start appreciating it, but when I did I ended up liking it a lot and it got better and better the longer it went. It feels really raw and unpolished most of the time, also a bit like a documentary for sure. I am still surprised to see some of the award srecognition it got. First of all, it managed the unusual feat to be nominated for Oscars not just in two different years, but not even in successive years, now that is really strange, amybe even unique. Anyway, it probably has to do with release dates. I am still glad it got the awards recognition. I am not surprised about the Foreign language Film nomination because it seems right up the Academy's alley, but the writing nod and especially the director nod I do find surprising. I am not sure if I would say these are deserved inclusions, but they are certainly inspired choices.Okay now let us take a look at the film itself. It is definitely not much of an actors' movie so it is alright I did not say too much about the cast then, but it is more about the story and historical context of France being in charge still in Algeria and Algerians rising up against their oppressors. Oh well that word may be too hard actually, lets call them hosts instead running the show. Or were they really. For me personally, what was most interesting here and most relevant was really the fact that even now way later there are many areas and regions on the globe where it is not unusual that terrorist attacks happen on a daily basis like it is the case here in this film, which is pretty sad because it indirectly shows that we have not learned a lot of anything. Anyway, I am drifting a bit too far away from the film here. Even if I say it is not an actors' movie, the cast is still pretty convincing, most of all in the first half the young terrorist who just enters the organisation as wee see during his trial attack, lets call it that. He is really good and memorable the actor. The colone who enters the film later on at the other side of the law is equally good. There is a bit of a clean structure which surprised me because the chaos in Algeria was far from clean. Early on we have the criminal approach and see how they kill several police officers at point blank and also other people who are close to the French. We find out about the violence and chaos being crucial there and dominant. After a while we find out how the police eventually organizes themselves to stand up to the challenge in several lengthy sequences that tell us about the successes they had. And finally as the film nears its end, it is really about both clashing and the police definitely winning as we see how all the most influential terrorists are tracked down and finally either arrested or killed. It's probably not what can be understood as a happy ending whatsoever, but the words that could be read on the screen before the closing credits that not much later finally Algeria becomes independent feels a bit like it. Still it must be said the film is only balck-and-white in terms of lack of color, but never black and white in terms of good and evil. It presents both sides and makes arguments for them both. i also really liked how they showed the colonel's interaction with the press after the arrest of a crucial criminal or when he is asked about criticism coming from an influential French writer. It is certainly a very smart movie and I may give it a go again at some point. I have a feeling it will only get better on rewatch. But it did not wow me to an extent where I would like to see it right away again. Nonetheless I think it is an especially good watch for the French to understand about their country's history and of course also for Algerians really almost a must-see as the entire film is set theref and it is about the perhaps most crucial era in the country's history. If it wasn't so violent at times, I'd say it is a movie that should be shown at every Algerian school. Okay, I guess that is pretty much it then. I am glad that this film got a lot of (awards) attention despite how really specific the subject is.

My review will be for the average, amateur movie buff. Here it goes...To begin, Battle of Algiers is a French film and therefore has subtitles. I have always said that subtitles takes something away from the movie. I think it has to do with reading while simultaneously looking at facial expressions and sometimes fast-moving action. I really believe that some film critics seem to think that subtitles mean the movie has more prestige, a kind of snob thing. I'm not in that crowd. Furthermore, some of the dialogue is spoken rapidly, so naturally those subtitles go by pretty quickly. If you have below average reading speed you are going to get cut-off in the middle of a subtitle.Secondly, I was unfamiliar with every actor and what's more, too many of them looked alike. That can happen when a lot of the cast is men aged 30-40, most of whom in scruffy beards. Also, I had no personal interest in any of the characters. I had a natural sympathy for the Algerians because they were seeking their independence. The movie did not heighten that sympathy in any great amount.One of the accolades I heard concerning the movie had to do with some of it looking very much like documentary film footage. I would agree with that. On the other hand, I'm not sure how much of a positive that really is. Anyway, I gave it a 6 out of 10.

The context - four years after Algerian independence had been won from the French and looking back on the war it took to get there, and at a time when the Vietnam war was being fought - puts it in stark contrast to the war movies from a couple of decades before. The film pulls few punches in showing violence and torture, so beware of its realism.What I found striking is that the leaders of the two sides seem upstanding, or at least living to some sort of rational code with moral values, and yet in the situation they're in, they choose to do some horrifying things. There is the leader of the French, who had been part of the (certainly noble) cause of the Resistance in WWII, explaining to reporters that if they want the French in Algiers, they have to accept the consequences. We then see the prisoners his men have captured being brutally tortured. There is the leader of the guerillas, explaining to his lieutenant in one scene how terrorism must segue to other forms of protest, and to reporters in another that if he had airplanes at his disposal, he wouldn't have to resort to it. And yet when we see baskets with bombs being left in public places with innocent civilians and children, it's hard to see the actions as necessary or honorable.The French military are in a difficult position, as when they strong-arm the population it naturally leads to more hatred of their presence, and when they're too lenient, letting Algerian women through security as a show of respect or because they've donned Western clothing, arms or bombs can slip through with devastating consequences. Meanwhile the insurgents adopt some nonviolent measure ala Gandhi, e.g. a worker's striker, but they believe that the French aren't just going to voluntarily give up their country without being forced (a reasonable view), and that violence in the form of terrorism is a big lever.It's hard to understand whether either side has to employ the tactics that they do, and it's in this fog of war, with violence leading to violence, that the film has devastating power. The underlying enemy is of course colonialism, which in this case lasted from 1830 to 1962, and whose inevitable outcome seems apparent - resentment, rebellion, bloodshed, and (eventual) independence, with variations on these themes all over the world. The film shows events as they happened in what I believe is a factual way, and it allows both sides to express their views, but its sympathies seem to be with the Algerians, or maybe it feels that way because we know in our hearts they should have a right to their country. And yet, it's tough to feel good about either side, or to be all that sanguine about mankind after watching it.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 3}, "heading": "The grim reality of war - and colonialism", "date": "2019-03-19T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4732328"}, {"content": "I watched the film for our high school social studies class.

We have a very difficult task to draw a parallel between the bombings as one of the terrifying form of terrorism, and the colonial power, which is reflected through different forms of lynchings, torture and intimidation.

For example, two of my favorite foreign films are \"Bicycle Thieves\" and \"Rashomon,\" but those films actually do interesting things with their camera-work. With The Battle of Algiers we just get a lot of standard (boring) camera-work with a lot of static shots to focus on conversations about the action rather than focusing on the action itself.The best aspect of the film is the characters who are a part of the rebellion and their motivations. We are introduced to one of the main characters in a very interesting way - this secret group of rebels does an initiation on Ali by checking to see if he would be loyal enough to shoot a cop, but they don't tell him this. We can see the manipulation this group exercises, though in their eyes it is necessary recruitment, and we should see it as this too since it is the Algerians who are the victim to French occupation of the city of Algiers as well as of the entire nation of Algeria.With the filmmakers choosing to revisit a scene from different view points there is obviously non-linear chronology, but I only understood this at the beginning and towards the end of the film. I was confused how the scene fit into the scenes surrounding it when it was shown for the second time in the film. I will have to rewatch this film some time in the future - after all it is regarded as one of the most important films ever made.I think I enjoyed the conclusion of this film much more than any part which preceded it, and that's because the conclusion is the most inspirational sequence of the entire movie. It is uplifting to see how Algerians rise up again years after the first rebellion group is decapitated (a metaphor you will understand if you watch the film), and this happens without great explanation.

It depicts true events which occurred during the Algerian war of independence from France, which was fought from 1955 \u2013 1962. The events depicted in the movie occurred during the Battle of Algiers which took place from 1954-1957. This film has been ranked in the top 100 films ever made. It was banned in France for five years where it was finally released in 1974. The Battle of Algiers is an important commentary on guerilla warfare. Revolutionary guerilla fighters holed up and grouped together in cells in the Casbah section of Algiers. French paratroopers attempted to wipe them out. The movie is about this struggle and the methods used by both sides. The tactics of the National Liberation Front (FLN) guerilla insurgency and the French counter-insurgency are shown in the film. The French colonial power committed atrocities against the civilian population of their Algerian colony and the colonized insurgents committed atrocities against the civilian population of their oppressors in a spiraling escalation of violence. The FLN engaged in acts of terrorism by placing bombs in public places such as restaurants, nightclubs, and airports, indiscriminately killing civilians in the European Quarter. The French paratroopers tortured, intimidated, and murdered members of the FLN. The use of waterboarding as an interrogation technique is depicted. Algeria eventually won its independence in 1962. Some of the scenes that really struck me were the incidents of waterboarding by the French Paratroopers, the men of the FLN covering themselves in burqas like women to disguise themselves and escape detection, FLN women dressing like European women and carrying bombs in baskets, and in the end the women ululating in victory when Algeria won its independence. The Battle Algiers is as relevant today as it was in 1965.The film was screened by the Pentagon in August 2003 as a field guide to fighting terrorism. Former National Security Adviser, Zbigniew Brezezinski, said: \"If you want to understand what is happening right now in Iraq, I recommend The Battle of Algiers.\" This film was also used by the Black Panthers as a training film. I am sure there are other terrorists groups that have been influenced by the film as well. The Boson Bombing suspects come immediately to mind. The film, shot in black and white, is a triumph of realistic production values and heavily influence by Italian Neorealism of the 1950's. It was filmed on location in Algiers using the real locations in the European quarters and the Casbah. It was so realistic that Pontecorvo had to issue a disclaimer that not one foot of documentary or newsreel footage was used in his two hours of film. Everything was shot live.

Instead the viewer gets a fresh historical scenario - the 1956/57 Algerian insurrection of the National Liberation Front (FLN) against the French colonists. Following the events laid out in the \"Souvenirs de la Bataille d'Alger\", a book written in prison by of one of the former FLN leaders, Yacef Saadi, it is an unvarnished account of a brutal reality that emerged as a natural consequence of colonial oppression. To add to the realism Yacef Saadi - now an Algerian senator - even plays a key part in the production.Outstanding feature of the film is that director Gillo Pontecorvo opts for a breathtakingly dramatized documentary style, a genre where he came from and clearly feels at home. The result is very close to newsreel footage, which makes it look like no other comparable war picture: Executions, demonstrations, strikes, bombings, interrogations, the house-to-house guerilla warfare look so real that Pontecorvo had to point out explicitly that not a single frame of actual documentary or news footage was used in the film. Furthermore the film stays as unbiased as possible and portrays both sides of the conflict: the rebels with the few, risky and desperate means they are capable of organizing to hurt the enemy, and the French paratroopers under Col. Mathieu striking back with unrelenting force in order to crush the FLN's backbone.

They're offering the Algerian people freedom from France not freedom from freedom . There's a subtlety to the ideas being put forward by both sides .

I could spend all day discussing the complex views put forward but there's a word limit of 1000 words . Just watch it and understand it There's some obvious flaws to the movie . One is that many of the deaths are a bit too bloodless . Another is that we never see what is happening outside of the Algerian capital though the war in the countryside is referred to . Perhaps the biggest complaint is that two years after the main action the story jumps forward where more violent demonstrations take place without the benefit of historical context but if you understand revolution it's because the occupying power hasn't provided any political gains to the wider Algerian population after temporarily beating the FLN . All insurrections are political in nature and if politicians can't bring a political carrot to the table after beating the insurrection to death with a stick then the violence will continue periodically and ultimately end in defeat .

We see the battle from both sides, as the French were defeated in Vietnam and want to prove their worth, while the Algerians want independence, so the military forces from both sides are sending in weaponry and bombs to claim their victory. We see the bad things that happen to those who were part of, and some innocents that were, until the final conclusion when Algeria won the war and achieved their independence.

Mathieu, Brahim Haggiag as Ali La Pointe, Tommaso Neri as Captain, Samia Kerbash as Fathia, Fusia El Kader as Halima, Ugo Paletti as Captain and Mohamed Ben Kassen as Petit Omar.

The film is able to effectively illustrate the socio-economical problems of colonization and is not biased in faulting either side. The fact that the movie did not fall into the traps that previous movies about colonization had is also something to be praised. The colonizers were not seen as single dimensional killing machines, but rather people with sense and a consciousness as we see in Col. Mathieu.

Gillo Pontecorvo's film focuses on both sides of the conflict, Ali La Pointe (Brahim Hadjadj), a young ex-prisoner who joins the National Liberation Front (FLN) and becomes a senior leader and Lieutenant-Colonel Mathieu (Jean Martin), a Free-French veteran who heads the Counter-Terrorism operation.Pontecorvo shows the harsh nature of this war, the Algerians fighting for independence, a simple nationalist idea of self-rule and the French, whilst not explained in the film, fought for two main reasons, the first being Algeria was seen as a part of France and the closest colony they had India that British had and they had already suffered two major defeats, World War II and Vietnam, they did not fancy a third. During this conflict there was no real good guys, the FLN were willing to use women and children to pass on messages, weapons and place bombs in busy caf\u00e9s. Teenagers are used to kill police officers and the FLN organises strikes to show it is a wider movement.

Whilst the Colons (French colonists) start to turn their racism against Arabs into violence attacks against anyone Arab, including children.Pontecorvo sets out to show the wider picture of what went on during the war: it was a tough, brutal war that American Generals during the Iraqi War have studied the conflict because of the similarities between them. There are a lot of modern parallels, from army officers having to talk to the media, the army trying to use media for their own aims, that there is two sides and two stories during a war and that characters are mixed, what is considered a legitimate target, what is terrorism, who is your real enemy, how you gather popular support and many more issues. You could thrown in a lot other historical events that are similar to Algeria, from the General Strikes in Apartheid South Africa to the Arab uprising.There is great acting throughout the film and you could easily believe in them and their actions. They are fully developed and there is a true mixed picture because that is what the world is like. Both sides were willing to do unpleasant, illegal acts. Pontecorvo knew how to add tension in a film, from the action scenes, to where people hide from the police and army or weapons. The music really adds to the atmosphere, some of the best judge music as the tension builds in scenes.

They can also be visceral and intense in the form of a movie like The Battle of Algiers. This film tells the story of one of the bloodiest revolutions in history. The French occupied Algeria was a desolate and harrowing landscape that became a bloody battleground for the revolutionaries who would stop at nothing to regain control of their country. The film focuses on the leaders of the revolution as they plan violent terrorist attacks against the French to show them they are deathly serious. Parts of the film are also from the French army perspective, following General Mathieu as he hunts down the leaders of the revolution and aims to take them down one by one. These two perspectives create a balanced view of the war, one where we are never quite sure who is in the wrong and it is up to the audience to discern if the shamelessly brutal methods the Algerians use to gain independence are justified or not. It is a difficult film, but one that is executed with visceral beauty and grandeur.The Battle of Algiers is a fascinating film that tells a emotionally chilling story about the determination and anguish of the Algerian people. Both sides are victimized in this story as the Algerians have their freedoms stripped and the French civilians living in Algeria pay the price through the revolutionaries acts of terrorism. There is a steadfast amount of determination here that is almost disturbing. However, I refrain from saying it is reasonable but there is of course reason behind the violence. These people want their freedom and they will stop at nothing to gain it. The various characters and perspectives in the film exemplify this determination so well and at such tense lengths that there are times where you won't even believe your eyes.On that note, The Battle of Algiers is also an intense audio-visual experience. The sights and sounds of the film are haunting yet so compelling. Ennio Morricone, one of the all time greatest film composers, leads the action of the film with a brilliantly chilling score which makes scenes of destruction and desolation all the more harrowing. The film never holds back, displaying to us the grotesque results of the violence which this revolution brings about. Bodies of children. Demolished homes of innocent civilians. These things disturb us and yet we never know who to blame. It makes the film all the more fascinating. Gillo Pontecorvo directs with harrowing grace and glorious chaos that absorbs us into the action so well. We are thrown into such insanity and disorder via the noisy rallies and the always bustling streets of the ravaged Algeria. The Battle of Algiers is a film which throws us into the middle of an experience and forces itself upon us, making us handle every emotion. It is not just a film, it's an experience.By todays standards, The Battle of Algiers may not seem like much but considering it was a film made in 1966 this is an impressive feat. The film doesn't sugarcoat anything. It is brutally honest and viscerally real. You won't find films like this from the time period often, especially ones that chronicle true events. This is a triumph in filmmaking that has forever changed the face of political cinema.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "A harrowing and powerful film", "date": "2011-07-17T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2460225"}, {"content": "Even tough the director of the movie neither french nor Algerian it is more on the Algerian sight since I felt more empathy towards Algerian sight.

I felt as if both the French in particular Col. Mathieu and the FLN leaders, the Algerians were forced to engage in evil in order to create some form of good that is deeply rooted with freedom as well as cultural identity. Behind the uprising for the Algerians lies nationalism and behind the French lies the ideals of colonialism.Overall the movie was truly brilliant and well thought out. This is one of my favorite movies of all time in cinema. It really opened my eyes to the art of film making. The ability, creative force and dedication that is required in order to produce a real work of art was clearly behind this particular film. I admire this film mostly because the footage looked very realistic as if they were the \"real deal\", having known that all the shots were recreated and not archival just impressed me moreover. Also I am so astounded and fascinated by the ideology and issue of war as depicted in this film. I even ended up writing my research paper in English class regarding terrorism mainly inspired after watching this film. It makes me wonder what truly drives terrorism and war itself. Out of all the movies I've seen in my college film class, this one is the only one that truly struck me the most. When one watches this film, one can't help but think about the ethics of war and people's ethical responsibility when one is faced to deal with it. At certain scenes such as when Algerian women would drop the bombs in public places that were surrounded with a great deal of civilians, I can't help but feel that helplessness for the civilians. Then again when I see scenes like the French blatantly disrespecting Algerian culture such as the scene when an Algerian couple had to marry in a rush in secrecy because they are not allowed to get married in their native tongue, I can't help but also sympathize as to why they are trying to revolt against the French. One of the reasons why this film is so moving is because it is not biased. As a viewer, you get to see both sides of the coin. Many would most probably side with one side, but I could not. I really believe that this film is something future generations can refer to in terms of critically analyzing the roots of war and terrorism. Obviously terrorist acts like 9/11 should not be condoned but we must try to at least understand it at a deeper level. This film has so many implied lessons that we can learn from. From tactical lessons of acquiring success like empathizing with the enemy or perhaps proportionality in terms of the outcome of people's actions. At the end though I just can't help but trace myself back to human nature and Chrales Darwin's theory of evolution: \"Survival of the fittest\". I think that partly the reasons for war lies in human nature's biological component of trying to adapt with change also it's human nature to feel such strong emotions that more often than not result to disputes or disagreements. It is not a question why this film should be watched. It MUST be seen that's the bottom line.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "\"Survival of the fittest\" -- the driving force of terrorism", "date": "2011-06-13T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2443134"}, {"content": "\"The Battle of Algiers\" is one of the most realistic film portrayals of war that I have ever seen. The story accurately portrays both the atrocities committed by the French colonizers and the horrors of modern terrorism used by the Algerians. The film is so important because of its unbiased approach, which is most likely a direct result of hiring the Italian director, Gillo Pontecorvo, to shoot the film. Pontecorvo shot the film as realistically as possible and it more closely resembles a documentary film rather than a war film. The recreation of the events in Algeria feels more authentic than any film I'd seen. Since the film uses mostly local and unknown Algerian actors in the streets of Algiers, you truly feel that in some moments you are apart of the film.The film is full of memorable moments and horrifying images that are sure to stay with you. One particular image is that of a child eating an ice cream cone in a restaurant before it is bombed. The scene creates such a sense of tension because it's obvious that almost everyone in the restaurant is going to die. It's an angering and heart wrenching scene that makes you think of the innocents affected by terrorism. In contrast, the scene that prompts the Algerians to start using widespread terrorism, involves a vigilante band of French police bombing the home of a suspected terrorist. The audience knows that the man is innocent and the bomb has unforeseen collateral damage when it destroys half the neighborhood. The next images are of the bodies of women and children being pulled from the rubble.

Both Algerians and the French are responsible in the escalating casualties throughout the film. The film avoids pointing fingers in a \"he-did-it-first\" style (although \"she\" is just as guilty). By avoiding a film with blame, neither of the sides actions are seen as justified. In true Italian Neo-Realism style, he used non-actors, shot on location, and gave the impression that large amounts of the film are taken from archival footage. The combination of this style along with a view detached from bias help make this film more than about France's imperialism and the FLN's terrorism. By escaping the individualistic events, La battaglia di Algeri can demonstrate easier that both sides committed their own atrocities. Each side had its own ideology and adamantly believed that they were doing what was in the best interest. By becoming blinded by their ambition, they were able to kill large groups of innocent people. Col. Mathieu is the only person who can openly admit how horrible he acts. Jean Martin, the only actual actor, portrays Col. Mathieu in a surreal, almost metafictional style. His talented acting harshly contrasts against the rest of the crew giving him an other-worldly presence. Every time Col. Mathieu talks, it seems that he is not so much a part of the action as much as he is breaking the fourth wall and talking to the audience directly. Despite the moral code that Col. Mathieu reinforces into the audience, the film feels very much like a textbook on the issue of imperialism and revolutions within their former colonies.

It's not difficult to see how the current conflicts in the Middle East and the American reaction to them relates to this film. In fact, the story of this film relates to any major conflict between an invading force that is more technologically advanced and seemingly more powerful than the population it seeks to control.

The film is one of the best examples of a world where black and white concepts simply do not exist. At one point, one of the French colonels in charge of stopping the Algerian resistance movement explains that the French government has only two options, and that any concept of right or wrong simply has nothing to do with the task at hand; that if the French want to stay in Algeria, they must accept what must be done, and that entails putting up with brutality and torture as the means to accomplish their end. This film can best be described as \"real.\" Nothing about it seems contrived, everything mirrors real life and the gray areas of the world that so much suffering seems to thrive in.

You are thrown some facts about Algerians being unhappy with French rule, given a flavor of their mistreatment at the checkpoints, but beyond that, one sees little of what is causing the unrest and cannot make an emotional connection with the characters. In fact, for me, the main character was not likable. At the end of the movie when it states that the Algerians won their independence, it is a purely intellectual process where you think, \"that's good,\" and have zero emotional response. On the other hand, you wonder why the Algerians chose violence as the first resort instead of a peaceful strike, and you are left with a feeling of disdain at the barbaric nature of their resistance. Violence should always be the last resort and should only be in self defense. Of course, one could argue that the French placed the first bomb, but that was a rogue bomb placed for the sole purpose of inciting the Algerians to violence so that the French would respond in kind.

Its semi documentary look and universal theme addressing a people's right to run their own country and not some foreign colonizer or more pertinent to today's front page, despotic dictator, has not lost an ounce of its urgency or punch as the same part of the world including Algeria itself wrestles with self determination. Street thief Ali Lapointe is doing time in an Algerian jail when he gets religion after witnessing the execution of an independence fighter. On the outside he attempts to enlist with the FLN but is first tested to measure the depth of his commitment. Passing that he becomes part of a cell that encourages strikes against the French oppressor but when this fails the cell turns to violence. Career officer Colonel Mathieu is given command to subdue the rebelling Arabs and he does so by imposing greater restrictions and resorting to torture of Casbah residents and suspects.Director Giullio Pontecervo's cold sober story telling rhythmically carried along by Ennio Morricone's score and cinematographer Marcello Gatti's lensing of the vertical Casbah battle field in all its restrictive claustrophobia makes for an ideal stage to depict an oppressed people brought to the edge with nowhere to turn. While Pontecervo shows both sides resorting to atrocity he clearly sympathizes with the Arab cause and takes every opportunity to make French paratroopers look like Nazi Africa Corps and act like Gestapo. Conversely he does not glamorize (or infect the film with a movie star ) the cold dispatch of Ali and his compatriots instead leaving it up to the immoral situation to make its case.Mirroring the Viet Nam conflict during its release and used as a training film by terrorists around the globe since then The Battle of Algiers remains a provocative and absorbing watch that should continue to resonate not only as a call to arms but as an example of cinema at its most powerful.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Battle still rages with power.", "date": "2011-03-21T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2402036"}, {"content": "No need to add to the assessment of this film's quality, but I can throw some light on aspects of the film. Someone who was present at the making of this film clarified to me what the significance of this film was, and why certain things are as they are.This film was commissioned after independence during the short reign of Ben Bella, but was not completed until after the coup of Boumedienne. The short- lived Ben Bella revolution was full of the ideals of genuine peace-loving idealism and cooperative socialism. The dispassionate message of the film was very much in tune with the intellectual thinking of the regime. (Compare, perhaps ,the film \"Memories of Underdevelopment\").Unfortunately the regime was easy prey for a military coup which happened during the making of the film. The crowd scenes, remarked on as so authentic, were in fact made so because this was the only form of gathering allowed immediately after the coup, and one is watching an odd blend of staging and reality, where Algerians were taking to the streets in a disguised protest against the coup.Are there any heroes in the film? Well, yes. If one looks closely towards the end of the film one can see the scrawled message \"Un seule hero - le peuple\" - (only one hero - the people).In a way then, one is witnessing not just a film about what had passed, but the beginning of the unfolding of the Algerian tragedy as it later became, and that is part of the film's potency.Beware of seeing this film and the events it portrays through today's prism. The question of religion did not arise - the movements were anti-colonial & nationalistic at first, as portrayed. Later socialist, secular, communistic and cooperative, but finally succumbing to militarism. These cannot be termed as \"Muslim\". Only after the failures of the subsequent militaristic and anti-democratic governments that popular political Islam gained in importance.As a footnote it may be observed that one of the Milk Bar bombers became a political figure in her own right, married a later president, and is, as I write, the Vice-President of the Council of the Nation.

Some others challenge your perception of what is right or wrong. And some movies penetrate your senses, elevating the cinematic enjoyment to an extraordinary level. \"The Battle of Algiers\", Gillo Pontecorvo's masterpiece of documentary-style realism, combines these three elements, turning a war movie with unknown actors and minimal dialogs into a unique cinematic experience.\"The Battle of Algiers\" is a fictional documentary about one of the most controversial periods of French history, during the decolonization era, when Algeria was a 130-year-old department of the French territory. But, as powerfully illustrated in the first frames, there was the city and there was the casbah. The film opens with a powerful symbol, the dorsal spine of its narrative, the cultural gap: a key element in our understanding of the roots of terrorism in one side and torture in another one, our hearts freed from any bias.Pontecorvo conveys his message by injecting an implacable logic in the script. When the 'hero' Ali La Pointe, a brave hot-headed fighter, joins the NLF, his first mission is to shoot a French policeman\u0085 with an empty gun. Later, Jafar, his mentor explains that it was the only way to prove he wasn't a spy; French could have sacrificed an Algerian to infiltrate a spy but not one of them. The same faultless logic is illustrated by the other main character, Colonel Mathieu, whose impeccable speech delivery and sunglasses are one of the most iconic elements of the film. Mathieu teaches us (through his soldiers) how the guerrilla's triangular structure means that each member knows only three persons, his leader and his two subordinates. \"To know them means to eliminate them\", which implies the tactical use of police methods even if it flirts sometimes with illegality. But since the prisoners must maintain silence for one day to let time to the organization \"to render any information useless\", we understand that one can't make omelet without breaking a few eggs.The same logic applies to terrorism: in the movie's most chilling part, we realize the efficiency of the NLF methods in a masterstroke of editing. We follow three women not visibly accustomed to wear occidental clothes or to cut their long hair, a precious symbol of beauty for Arabic women. They dutifully make themselves look pretty and occidental enough to fool the French guards who don't even search them. Each one leaves a bomb hidden in her basket in a public place. Besides the editing which creates one of the greatest cinematic montages, the directing prevents the film from any desensitizing effect of violence. Pontecorvo shows us the faces of the soon-to-be victims, laughing, chatting, a kid licking an ice-cream and young people dancing, fresh and smiling faces making ours particularly uneasy. Even the woman who planted the bomb avoids looking straight before leaving not to let an ounce of guilt weighing her heart down. But I was devoured by the guilt of being \"part of\" the operation, when the first explosion occurred in a devastating realism and the boys and girls went out of the dance-club, I just wanted to shout them not to go back inside \u0085 The bombing sequence is the part of the film that definitely contradicts any accusation of bias. But to keep the vital dosage of impartiality, the interview of the NLF member Ben H'midi indirectly explained (not justified) the use of terrorism with an ironic \"Give us your bombers, and you can have our baskets\" \"The Battle of Algiers\" shows the origins of acts we label as cruel with never putting them into perspective. When the only rule is to win, the ends justify the means: \"Should we remain in Algeria? If you answer \"yes,\" then you must accept all the necessary consequences.\" says Mathieu. Even the civilians are killed by the NLF, through terrorism or heartless drive-by shootings. But the film doesn't exalt these acts nor does it dehumanize the authors: Mathieu respects Ben H'midi's patriotism and even Jafar admits it'll take more than terrorism to mobilize the population. Still, it's no surprise the film has been screened in the Pentagon during the Iraq War or Israel during the Intifada. This highlights the power of movies, to understand urban guerrilla is almost impossible without watching \"The Battle of Algiers\". But as documentary as it is, it's still a film, in the good sense of the word.I don't think the movie is as dispassionate as it's often described, the last discussion with Mathieu reminds the old adage, winning the battle, but not necessarily the war. It was a tactical not strategic victory. And yes, for some reason, the war started again, concluding the film with one of its most spectacular scenes, featuring so realistic riots, I still wonder how Pontecorvo recreated this. The climactic conclusion will haunt me forever through this scene where the policeman asks the population \"What do you want?\" and then, behind the mist, you hear people's shouts punctuated with Algerian women's strident yodels \u0085 they shout and dance, waving the new Algerian banner in one my most thrilling cinematic moments, even more relevant when you think of the current events in Egypt, Tunisia and other Arab countries, the shouts of despair and chants of hopes, from overly passionate populations who know the value of freedom enough to fight for it.This in an exhilarating movie which, more personally, made me shudder so many times I thought I left my window open. But then I realized this sensation in my shoulders was the weight of affiliation, to a culture that seems to get things the hard way, a hot blooded culture that inhabits the eyes of my Algerian grand-mother who lived that time ... a sensibility that I inherited, making me react to the beautiful closing theme with deep emotions and hopes for a better future", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 3}, "heading": "A Historical Masterpiece of Documentary-style Realism ...", "date": "2011-02-14T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2385423"}, {"content": "this movie is out there and reveals just about everything that happened between the Algerians and the French.

I really admired the visual storytelling element of the film, which had a very documentary style to it. All the \"war\" scenes looks like actual footages. I also really liked how Pontecorvo set up the character of Ali La Pointe. The first scene we get of him is this guy running away from the police. He trips on the foot of a wisecrack French guy and Ali has a choice, to keep running to avoid getting caught by the police or to teach the French guy a lesson. Ali punches the French guy in the face. There's no dialogue, no long introduction, just a simple scene and right away we know what kind of guy Ali is. Another interesting point I realized while watching the film was that usually in film where a group of people are conquered by another, the conquered group is usually somehow culturally/socially converted and integrated into society but the Algerians were completely segregated.

For example the scene where the racing track was blown up it was so realistic that it made people think that the movie was a documentary. A scene that caught my eyes the most was the scene where Ali is tripped by a Caucasian man and they exchange a very intriguing stare. Even though Ali was on the floor, his did not waiver as he stare into the Caucasian man's eyes.

The movie shows atrocities committed by both sides and doesn't seem to show undue sympathy for either, a remarkable accomplishment for any film, let alone one made so soon after the events and on such an emotionally charged topic as colonial resistance and terrorism.At some points the film rivals the great scenes of any crime and war movie as we see the characters on both sites execute their plots, be it paratroopers storming a rebel hideout or female bombers infiltrating hangouts in the European Quarter.

As a result, The Battle of Algiers is often considered a breakthrough in cinema, the first of its kind. It is a fictional film based on something that has happened in real life, and of which it portrays so realistically that it is hard to believe that it is not a two-hour long documentary footage.Released only four years after the independence of Algeria, Pontecorvo's film touches upon a nation's suffering and hope during the French occupation, detailing the violent activities of the National Liberation Front (FLN in abbreviated French), a revolutionary group that was systematically wiped out but whose sacrificial efforts became etched in the collective psyche of the Algerians, prompting them to rise up to their oppressors.The film is also noted especially for its outstanding direction, of which Pontecorvo deservedly earned an Oscar nomination for. Scenes where hundreds of innocent Algerians roam the streets only to be gunned down by the French military evoke a powerful sense of unjust and tragedy. The use of wide, composed shots and long lens allow the situation to unfold almost like a live event, its visual scope unparalleled at that time.Of equal impressiveness are scenes of bombs planted by the FLN that explode in a number of crowded places. The camera captures the real-time explosions as the non-actors try frantically to get away from the blast. Considering that this was the sixties when computer visual effects were not in existence yet, these dangerous feats could only be filmed as they happened.Even though Pontecorvo's film tries to emphasize on the plight of the Algerians (with disturbing scenes of torture), it is still a fair, unbiased take on the French military. It portrays Colonel Mathieu (Jean Martin), the chief officer in charge of restoring order to the colony, as someone who understands and sympathizes with the enemy, attempting to seek cooperation with them rather than trying to annihilate them.Pontecorvo's use of Ennio Morricone's deeply haunting music as accompaniment to scenes of Algerian victims of bombings (and later, French civilian victims in another sequence) reflects the collateral effect of war on those caught in the crossfire. In many sequences, a running radio commentary delivering propagandistic messages is broadcasted, heightening the sense of realism already so vividly brought to the screen.Widely regarded as one of cinema's most important films, The Battle of Algiers is still not widely seen by the mainstream audience. That needs to change because this is a masterpiece, a film with universal themes of freedom and independence, and a global reach that would resonate strongly with anyone who believes in those ideals.SCORE: 9.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "A film with universal themes of freedom and independence, and a global reach that would resonate strongly with anyone who believes in those ideals.", "date": "2010-08-26T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2301285"}, {"content": "Battle of Algiers is based on Civil-War for the independence of Algeria from the occupation of France started by the National Liberation Front of Algiers in the year 1954,the war came to an end with the independence of Algeria in 1962.The movie shows the civil war from two different view points of both the Algerian peoples who aimed to obtain their independence at any cost and of French authorities who aimed to hold their occupation over Algeria.We see the war from beginning to end with the story of a young man Ali La Pointe who became a rebel hero from a small criminal.When things get out of control from French police the French Military intervened to handle the situation under the command of Col. Mathieu.We see the account of bloody struggles from both sides,the torture and suppressive methods used by military to end the struggle or the bomb explosions and guerrilla war tactics used by NLF to obtain freedom,both French Military and NLF try very extreme and violent measures to counter attack each other.The half documentary,half fiction style of movie from the director Gillo Pontecorvo gives us the very realistic feel and drew us close and connected to the movie.The screenplay is written very well in both documentary and fiction style.It is made with very precise technical perfection,the use of camera to create a feel of documentary movie and also the thrill and tension of a war movie gives us a unique and mind-blowing ride that can be deliver from watching this movie only. the scenes of bomb explosion,assassinations and protest scenes at end of movie were shot very perfectly and seemed to be very real with the brilliant background score by one of my favorites Ennio Morricone.Battle of Algiers is the most hard hitting and violent Civil-War depiction,i have ever seen.The best thing about the movie is that it is not a propaganda movie even if the movie was made under the authority of government of Algeria the movie doesn't justify any particular side,this movie do not have any thing such as struggle between good and bad,instead of preaching and manipulating us,this movie just shows us and tells us accurately horrible and terrifying casualties of a Civil-War.Without any doubt this movie is greatest political thriller and one of the greatest war movie ever made for me.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Greatest Civil-War movie ever made....................", "date": "2010-07-11T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2277221"}, {"content": "Battle of Algiers is a story about Algerian war of Independence from French.

One of my favorite scenes is one in which three Algerian woman transform themselves into \"attractive\" French women in order to sneak bombs undetected into the popular French quarter. The music that plays serves as a kind of elevated heartbeat, and you can't help but feel what they must be feeling as you look into their beautiful faces and see the fear and determination in their eyes.

Both are portrayed with equal objectivity very successfully. A film in the style of realism, it looks much like a documentary, but actually uses NO \"News Footage,\" at all and is completely staged. This is quite remarkable and quite an accomplishment. The movie utilizes all non-actors (except one), even more amazing, and uses real locations, and people as the characters. All of this adding to a sense of a documentary, which it is not. Even one of the main characters is played by himself (the Producer of the movie (Saadi Yacef, playing a character based on himself - - El-hadi Jafar. The scenes are all shot on location with a hand held camera, utilizing natural light, locations, and real people. This film is \"Realism\" with a documentary feel. Music is very important in this film and was scored by Maricone, who has done hundreds of films and did a wonderful and often hauntingly beautiful job on this film. The premise of the film is that there is a loss of cultural identity when a country is colonized, which has certain costs and ramifications, and that, no country can ever, in the end, be run by or ruled by others. It has never lasted, and is always temporary. Racism is a main subject of this movie as one group (the French colonists) try to impose their value systems on the Algerian people, and the resistance that takes place. The film also depicts, especially through the \"raw,\" uneducated Protagonist \"Ali,\" the use of illiteracy, which is a weapon in colonization, and how lack of education is a problem here. Ali is also one of the most complex characters in the movie, as well as Omar, the little boy. This movie makes an effort to show both sides of the story, the rationale of each side. The movie also served as a sort of \"cautionary tale,\" of what could happen in Vietnam, and for this reason, the film was banned in the U.S. The film did actually turn out to be prophetic in this instance, and when it was released caused quite a stir. It also fueled the fire surrounding the plight of the African American in American ghettos, as equated with the Algerian Casbah, and the socio-economic implications. The movie also serves to humanize the \"Terrorist,\" giving them a face and cause and showing their motivations. \"Why does a terrorist become a terrorist.\" Since its initial release, this film has had a resurgence and has been used by groups as diverse as the \"black panthers,\" to the U.S. government in briefings and instruction on urban guerrilla warfare. So in many ways, it is a very contemporary subject matter, even though it was made over 40 years ago. In addition, one of the scariest scenes of the movie is when the children beat up an old drunk man for no reason.

There can in the end never be any sort of justification for the killing of an innocent person regardless of the cause this film however does not immediately write these actions off as malicious but rather asks the watcher to look further into the issue and examine why this event took place to begin with. Unlike just about every film made today there is no side the film makers choose; the events are simply portrayed with striking detail and we the audience must make our judgments of whom is right and who is wrong. The reason why this film leaves such an impression at least to me is because we know event such as Colonel Mathieu \"interrogations,\" in which the information is forcefully taken by whatever mean necessary have happened, still currently happen, and will continue to happen. Mathieu himself rationalizes this in his mission statement to his troops claiming the terrorists or freedom fighters are told to keep quiet for 24 hours while the National Liberation Front changes the information the cell captured knew. Everyday it seems I read in the newspaper of deaths happening in occupied places where superpowers intervene where they should not have, or forces back by superpowers kill humanitarians trying to bring aid to a systematically incapacitated nation slowly dying because \"terrorist\" are aided there. We don't have to look far to see how thoroughly the lessons of our past are ignored, and the role of film is to comment, a solution is not needed the comment is where the power of the art lies.Perspective is a powerful idea because it is like a fingerprint unique for everyone, and this film explores how polarized perspective can become when a national and religious identity is at stake. The French as colonizers see themselves as creators of structure for this society to function more efficiently with lots of bureaucracy as well as European technologies, and French cooking presumably? On the other hand the French only ask for a small portion (50% or more?) of the natural resources and land. Well there was no real chance to the native Algerians to decide what happens as the French forcefully colonized the land, people moved there and a more European way of life was establish to the relief of all except the vast majority of those who wanted nothing to do with Europe in the first place. Muslim culture which had dominated the region for thousands of years was forced behind barbed wire fences where soldiers with weapons monitored its dealings. Enter discontent which became deeply rooted within the people who once owned all the land not just a portion, and like all revolutions it starts slowly maybe with non violent means but far to often something changes and violence makes its tragic debut perhaps with officers being shot as they patrol, it starts to build as the occupiers botch operation after operation more and more innocent people start to die eventually each side trying to send a louder message.

The French attack worked very well, at first you realize as viewer \"that good that should show The Algerians not to kill in cold blood\". But then in seconds your whole perception shifts to a different direction, when you come upon the aftermath of the apartment Bombing. There some films that hardly shows the aftermath of retaliation so in order to not show sorrow to the victims. The moment to see the young children & women were the main casualties of the attack. Then the whole movie becomes a classical game of chess. Which Race can strike the most efficient? Algerians activated a more well balance plan by use of Multiplying Bombs all well know public Establishment where the French socialize among each other. Makes wonder at that point who should I fear or who feel empathy more? Col. Mathieu comes in the picture; he is introduced as some kind of folk Hero or Savior. Mathieu use everything in his will power to neutralize all Algerian plans for more bloodshed towards French. In the end no side really won, just lives were taken & permanently shattered. Does taking someone's land worth killing or dying for? It's taking back you land which what truly yours worth killing or dying for?

You get to see all the different types of people that are in these places, from old men and women in casual conversation to toddlers just enjoying an ice cream.

The loss of ones own cultural identity is something I have trouble relating to as I am an American born citizen. However, the film spoke numbers to audience members of the time in relation to what COULD be the possible outcome of the happenings in Vietnam and what eventually transpired. I respected Pontecorvo's efforts in remaining neutral to the French and Algerian side in his film making process. However, as an audience member I felt compassion for the Algiers alone. The altruistic \"behavior\" of the French were seen as a facade in my eyes. The French overtook Algeria as their own 130 years prior to the story in the film of the Algiers rebellion. They pushed the Algiers into a ghetto where they were surveyed and treated with diminishing respect. Shooting in natural locations and with non-actors made my experience of watching this film a memorable one. When drinking alcohol was prohibited in the country, there is a scene where an old man is taunted by the little children, they chorus \"wino\" and attack him. I felt remorse for the old man, and in the scheme of things his tiny flaw of alcoholism in the eyes of the colonized government was illustrated to me as the beginnings of a dictatorship. A ruling in which a man may not choose his drink or where he treads. The film resonates to cultures all around the world in its message of the examination of a repressed culture that rebels. Pontecorvo does not justify the actions of the Algiers or the French, but rather, he allows the viewer to come to their own conclusion on what is truly altruistic.

Covering the period from roughly 1954 to 1957, the film is a masterclass in cinema verite. Indeed, the film seemed so \"realistic\" when it first premiered, that audiences had to be reminded with a disclaimer that it wasn't a documentary.Proudly anti-colonialist, the film focuses on the Muslim Quarter of Algiers, also known as the Casbah, where a group of resistance fighters mobilize and fight against the French. But though we sympathise with the small band of revolutionaries and share their desire for independence (Pontecorvo deftly shows the injustices suffered by the Algerians under French rule), \"The Battle of Algiers\" is careful not to romanticise its rebels. Their bombs kill civilians, they murder innocents, and at times they are more savage than the French.Ben M'Hidi, the leader of the resistance, himself articulates his disdain for violence. \"Acts of violence don't win wars,\" he says. \"Terrorism is useful as a start. But then, the people themselves must act. That's the rational behind this strike: to mobilize all Algerians, to assess our strength.\" Today the film resonates with current events in the Middle East to such an extent that the US Defence Department screened \"Algiers\" at the outset of the Iraq invasion. What's sickening is that the Defence Department uses the film as a tool to teach how to clamp down on armed resistance. The film's larger point seems to have gone unnoticed by those in Power, the US' colonialist actions, be they in Iraq, Vietnam, or across much of Latin America and Asia over the past century, echoing France's actions in this film.More interesting, though, are the documentaries included on the film's recently released Criterion DVD. In one documentary, Pontecorvo revisits Algeria in an effort to see how far the country has come since its independence. Unfortunately, he is disappointed with what he sees.As oil revenues declined in the late 80s, Algeria's governing regime no longer had the funds to bolster its dreams of modernization. As a result, an increasingly disillusioned middle class (despite a rise in university degrees, there was little upward mobility as many of the prestigious jobs were still held by the French) turned to more extreme Islamist parties who promised to return Algeria to its \"Islamic roots\". The ideals of these extremists were at complete odds with the FLN (The Front De Liberation Nationale), the coalition of rebels we see defeating the French in the film. The FLN, though they relied on religious forces and symbols to mobilize the population behind the cause of independence, ultimately viewed religion from a utilitarian perspective, sufficient for mass mobilization but inadequate as a template for governance.So with faith in the FLN shattered, voters turned to more extreme parties, all of whom threatened to create a kind of totalitarian form of Islam. And it is this which Pontecorvo seems to fear the most. With the engineered destruction of Marxism-Lenism, fundamentalist Islam became the world's leading anti-American ideology. The US, ironically, has been the largest supporter of psycho Islamic movements. From their perspective, better psycho dictators in power, than actual egalitarian movements. So the Algeria Pontecorvo revisits seems to be one that has shut itself off from the world and become deeply suspicious of foreigners and non-Muslims. It is a country faced with many economic and social problems, suspicious of all \"western styled\" government models. (Pontecorvo's doc was made in the late 80s. Today Algeria has shrugged off its nationalist roots and embraced the free market)Of course Pontecorvo makes it clear in the documentary that there is a distinction between Islam (a religion) and fundamentalist Islam (an ideology). One can oppose the ideology while respecting the faith. Secondly, he stresses that meaningful change is always slow. When asked about women being forced to wear veils and the terrible economic problems in some areas, the director states that it will take decades of revolution for things to improve. The point he makes is not to interfere. To let people decide their own fate and forge their own national identities.8.5/10 \u2013 Though its \"documentarian\" style lacks the power it once had, and though realist works always suffer from a certain directness (everything communicated bluntly, little to ponder or absorb after etc), this is a powerful and influential film.

Neither Ali la Pointe, the leader of the independence movement, nor the French Colonel Mattheiu, who is in charge of the operation, ever states that what he is doing is wrong.

Director Pontecorvo was under the influence of Italian masterpiece 'Rome, Open City' while shooting what would become his own grand work; made to feel like a documentary, the film plots around the Algerian revolutionists wanting independence from French government. Using the zoom effect, Pontecorvo aims in on the details of humanity, on the shackled humanity that faces chaos. Adding on emotionally laden music by Pontecorvo himself and master film composer Ennio Morricone, the film certainly finds a beating heart amongst all the smoky ruins and bloody torture. Pontecorvo was by some back in the 60ties declared a \"pro-Marxist\" as he doesn't always steer his motivations objectively, but finely balances the line between propaganda and pure observation.

I would consider it equal with Spielberg's Schlinder's List. The reason why I compare these two films is they are able to take a large conflict and scale it down to size and give faces the the good and the evil. The film follows the resistance of the Algerian people with the French government who has been in power for over 130 years. The basic theme of the movie, (What I took away from it) is eggs must be broken to make an omelet and a whole lot of more eggs need to be broken to win independence from the French. ALI is one of the rebel fighters who joins an organized coalition to kill as many French civilians and ranking French officials. The brains of the rebellion Djafar organizes the killings of many French citizens. Col. Mathieu is part of the French military battling to keep peace among the conquered country. After the Algerian hit squads begin killing French police, innocent Algerians are targeted for the retaliation. After the French civilians retaliate, the Algerians dress their women to look like French women to plant bombs in densely populated clubs and bars. In response to that, the French civilians plant a bomb in a crowded ghetto, destroying houses and many many people. So its a very vicious back and forth with people. After watching the movie for almost two hours I began to get desensitized to the value of life and everyone getting brutally murdered. I don't know if that was the director's plan, but I was definitely feeling psychological strain. Why I think this movie is better than Schlinder's List is the fact we get to see all of the repercussions to every action. Everything that was destroyed had a equivalent disaster that built into a massive chain of events. Schlinder's list is really focused on Oskar Schlinder for the most part. Knowing nothing prior to France's occupation over Algeria, it was a nice history lesson that I would not stumble across unless I took film 7 at Santa Monica with Prof. Carrosco. I recommend him to anyone who enjoys movies and wants to expand their understanding of film as an art-form. Back to the review. In the end, ALI dies and Djafar turns himself in to save his own life. The only criticism I have for great movies that are epic is size is the amount of energy one must invest to get through the movie.

From this spirit of Independence came Gillo Pontecorvo's The Battle of Algiers, which chronicles with some drama the Algerian resistance against the French settlers.Mixing the genres of war and thriller, this masterpiece shows the messy business of fighting for freedom. What I loved about this movie was its balance in the portrayal of both sides. Civil uprisings are ugly, and Pontecorvo shows how both settlers and settled can and will use any means to achieve their goals.First we have the Algerian resistance, targeting initially policemen. As the French authorities retaliate against civilians, the resistance soon goes after French civilians too. And back and forth in an escalation of violence which soon brings in the paratroopers with their torture methods to smoke out hidden terrorists.The French soldiers of course seem monsters, but its representative, Colonel Mathieu, reminds people those were the same soldiers who fought in the French resistance against the Nazis and who employ torture because the French public opinion Algeria to remain French. In a movie without clear heroes and villains, Pontecorvo shows one of the tragedies of war: how normal people can easily lose their innocence for their beliefs.Besides being expertly written and directed, the cast is also excellent, with newcomer Brahim Hadjadj playing a very human terrorist, Jean Martin as the impenetrable Colonel Mathieu and Saadi Yacef playing Djafar, the head of the resistance.Ennio Morricone, who most have scored all Italian movies of this period, gives us another one of his impressive scores, dramatic, exciting, tense and melancholic in all the right places.Another great aspect of this movie is the editing itself. This has some of the best silent montages I've ever seen, from people searching for bodies in a bombed out house, to three terrorist women preparing themselves to blow up their bombs, to the French soldiers invading the Casbah and rounding up all suspects. This movie works in powerful visuals without the aid of words, making it a fine example of film language at its best.The Battle of Algiers is a film not to be missed.

Needless to say, the sense of realism in films like Ladri di Biciclette, and this film, La battaglia di Algeri, seems otherwise extinct.

While audiences around the globe cringe at its tragic narrative, military personnel watch it in order to understand the nature of urban-based guerilla warfare. Either way, the end result is the same: Empire is a Sisyphean business.The movie begins on a raid and then quickly dissolves into the story leading up to the raid. Ali La Pointe is one of the highest leaders in the resistance of French control in Algiers, a resistance structured by a hierarchy of anonymity so that no one tier of it can lead directly to the rest. The occupiers are forced to use arrest and torture in order to ferret out every member, and only through the most extreme activities are successful. Their success, however, hardly wins the overall war. In the end, nobody wins.Gillo Ponticorvo's approach is somewhere between that of Rome, Open City and Salvatore Guiliano. In theory, he's using realistic and documentary modes of expression, and yet those very grainy frames he creates is in its own way a darkly Romantic view of society degrading. His best approach to realism is in the use of non-professional actors, who all are remarkable.Hopefully no one stops paying attention. Sure, anybody can find parallels between what happens in this movie and what's happening today, but more importantly it's important to keep in mind how the movie documents a process over a specific time, and how that process can re-arise again and again and again.

The film is unforgettable for its realistic, documentary look. There have been other films to obtain such an image, but \"Battle\" is outstanding in the way so large a cast was employed. Indeed, it's hard to believe so many \"extras\" could be recruited, much less give such convincing performances.Two critical quotes of the film are notable: the Washington Post hailed it as being \"just as important for our time as the work of Griffith, Riefenstahl, Dryer and Visconti were for theirs.\" And the New Yorker exclaimed, \"Pontocorvo and his team show the capability of convincing the cinema public that revolution, in certain circumstances, is a necessary thing.\" While the rebels are given a sympathetic perspective, the French are likewise fairly depicted--all resulting in a kind of observational, reportorial essay on a historical event.

Pontecorvo's and Franco Salinas' screenplay is very well articulated with memorable quotes and a dramatic structure which that continue to keep the picture tense yet emotionally intriguing. Both Pontecorvo and Salinas chose an interaction of characters from both sides of the war to feel passionate about their stance, thus leaving the picture to sympathize for both peoples, the FLN and the French civilians. Through the deaths of innocents, violence begins to escalate from the beginning, all the way to an explosive ending. Though no protagonist took the film by storm, Pontecorvo weaved a film where all the characters were equally felt for. His structure feels like a race of increasing violent acts, beginning with small gun battles and moving into the direction of time-bombs as acts of terrorism and revenge came soaring. Ennio Morricone's score couldn't help the picture anymore than make it an emotional driven roller-coaster, providing a tear or two in the process. When tension could be felt, Morricone exploded the scene with what sounds like a score of haunting rattling noises that get louder and louder. And finally, when tragedy strikes, like the scene when the Algerians begin looking for their loved ones in the bombs ruffle, Morricone goes into a haunting notion of a score driving one to feel sympathy for the Algerians. Overall, The Battle of Algiers is a foreign right masterpiece telling the horrors of terrorism, without creating a protagonist to sympathize for.

It is a film based on real events that gives you, the audience, the feel of those events actually unfolding before your eyes, which is a rarity to say the least. What is even rarer is what makes this film so good: it is perhaps the most successful documentary approach recreation of actual events ever produced.One of the biggest keys to the documentary approach of the film is the fact that the actors do not seem to be acting. Often it is the very fact that actors do seems to be acting that can kill the reality of a film like this one yet this represents one of the successful attempts at using not just actors but non-actors to create a seamless whole. In fact one of the best decisions made by Gillo Pontecorvo was to cast Saadi Yacef who was directly involved in the real events to effectively play himself. The advantage of this is that it adds an even greater degree of verisimilitude to the film and its approach.The documentary approach is in fact the very key to the success of The Battle Of Algiers. The cinematography wobbles, zooms and frames in the way that a documentary film would if filming these events as they were taking place and gives the film the visual reference of a documentary. The result of this is the feeling in the midst of riots, shooting, bombings, meetings, torturing etc. In short the film gives the feeling of being in the midst of a modern revolution from both sides of it.In fact it is the very fact that The Battle Of Algiers covers both sides that makes the film stand-out. It is true that the filmmakers have an obvious bias for the FLN, yet one must look deeper into the film. Despite that bias the film pulls no punches on the morals of terrorism. The very fact that is shows shooting and bombings up close and personal and the aftermaths as well in perhaps the single best example of this. Neither side be it the FLN with their terrorist attacks of the French with their paratroopers using torture is portrayed as the definite good guys or bad guys to put it in more conventional, literal terms. The film proves that one point of view is as valid as the other, something rather unique to this film. The bias is for the FLN and the journey of Ali La Pointe from average Algerian to revolutionary yet the fact is that the film shows both sides. The point of this: nobody is right yet nobodies wrong and both sides of any conflict must understand this. That fact alone makes the film as relevant today as it was forty plus years ago.Another strong element of the film is its rather sparse score. The score was a collaboration between films core master Ennio Morricone and Pontecorvo and it is proof of the old saying less is more. The score provided emotional clout to an all ready emotionally charged film from the almost thunderous paratrooper theme to the heartbreaking piece used in the aftermath of both the French and FLN bombings. In fact that latter piece alone makes clear the intent of those scenes: human suffering in universal no matter which side of a conflict you are on. It is a unique score for a unique film.The Battle Of Algiers is a unique film in many ways. From the verisimilitude of its cast to its documentary approach and unique view of modern revolutions and terrorism, few films can match the sheer power and realism of this film. It is this uncommon aspect that makes the film unique even some four decades after it was made.

It chiefly deals with what the great social scientist Franz Fanton termed in his classic The wretched of the earth, \"the pitfalls of national consciousness\" \u0096 colonialism. While it seeks to depict the colonial strife between the native Algerians and their French occupiers, what makes this film so potent even today is its ability to transcend global barriers; it could apply just as well to the Palestinian problem, to Afghanistan, our very own monumental struggle against the British Raj, or to any of the classic Latin American standoffs that pit a US-backed rightist government against Marxist left-wing guerrillas \u0096 be it Nicaragua or El Salvador.The film depicts an important segment in the Franco-Algerian colonial strife \u0096 the urban skirmishes between the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) and the French paratroopers between 1954-1957, commonly known as the \"Battle of Algiers\".It opens with the brutal interrogation of an FLN member by the French paratroopers, who is tortured into giving the whereabouts of Ali La Pointe, an important FLN fighter. We next see the roll of credits while French paratroopers are storming the Kasbah (The native Arab quarter) with a view to surround Ali La Pointe with Ennio Morricone's riveting martial soundtrack hammering away in the background. The next frame shows Ali being asked to surrender or face death by dynamite. The screen then dissolves on a pensive Ali and the viewer sees the story gradually unfold in the form of a flashback. This astounding opening sequence sets the standard for what is to follow for the remainder of the film. Director Gillo Pontecorvo, himself a man of the left, was greatly influenced by his mentor Roberto Rossellini's Paisan(1946), which made great use of \"naturalism\". Along with Marxist writer Franco Solinas, Pontecorvo fashioned a screenplay which would be enacted by natural actors \u0096 not big name stars (in fact, with the exception of the French Paratroop Colonel Mathieu, played by stage actor Jean Martin, the rest of the cast is entirely made up of non-professionals!).This, coupled with the usage of 16 mm hand-held cameras gave the film a stunning feel of \"realism\" which is usually brought about by a documentary film \u0096 especially in the mob scenes with the Algerian women chanting hysterically. As a result, this led to many viewers and critics being confused as to whether this film was a documentary or not containing several reels of footage. (The producers as a result, proudly put a general disclaimer on the film stating not a single reel had been used)Pontecorvo and Solinas strongly took the median path when dealing with the politics of the French and Algerian sides, though polemically siding with the FLN. The film documents the brutalities of the French paratroopers \u0096 as is evident in chilling scenes depicting torture by using blowtorches and half-drowning victims in their efforts to decapitate the FLN, while balancing those with the terror tactics of the FLN \u0096 as in the bombing of French public places of leisure and entertainment. The objective nature of the film, its sanctimonious attitude towards truth, and its supercharged atmosphere of political awareness have undoubtedly inspired future filmmakers like Costa-Gavras, Marcel Ophuls and Oliver Stone.For instance, we see in the best works of Costa-Gavras like Z and State of Siege, a frenetic tension and sense of political urgency which makes one aware of the reality of time and place in which one is living in. And as for timeliness and reality, Battle of Algiers is an uncomfortable reminder of the Iraqi occupation, posing important questions on colonialism, imperialism and the relationship between the \"occupier\" and the \"occupied\".", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "A visual \"Fantonian\" experience!", "date": "2008-03-13T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1838966"}, {"content": "This movie about the Algerian's fight for independence from over one hundred years of French occupation is a serious undertaking.

Why, after over a hundred years of French occupation did the Algerian resistance coalesce so dramatically in the late 1950s? At the inception of the resistance one of the Frenchman even minimizes it with the comment that the French and Algerians have gotten along for over a century, so why should that not continue?

Set in French-occupied Algeria, it tracks the story of Algerian resistance and attempts for liberation, and French countermeasures. While it does not paint an especially sympathetic portrait of the French, it doesn't shy away from showing Algerians placing bombs in civilian areas either. It does, however, depict the way that no action is without cause or consequence. From the very beginning, it is quite frank, without being gratuitously gruesome, about the ugly realities of torture \u0096 something of a taboo in the present climate \u0096 and of the way that violence begets violence, in an unsustainable spiral. Interestingly, although the film ends with a seeming defeat for one side, those watching the film today will know how things turned out in the time after the closing events. This knowledge gives a special poignance to the seemingly futile actions of resistance.Although the movie's focus is on the central character, Ali La Pointe, a young Algerian who becomes politicized and radicalized after witnessing an execution by guillotine, it really is the story of the Algerian community as a whole. The film depicts the steady accretion of humiliation and despair around the core of French occupation. Many youths are unemployed, and the contemptuous treatment they receive at the hands of the French, to whom they are of interest only as servants, save when pretty girls are whistled at, serves to further stoke their anger. The initiation of Ali into the FLN is like joining a gang \u0096 he must prove himself by making himself vulnerable. The FLN addresses not only the material losses of the Algerian people, but also their loss of dignity. The daring raids against French police, the seizure of the microphone used to blast disheartening messages into the Algerian quarter, and other such tactics function to unite and uplift the community by putting active resistance on open display. The French respond by escalating violence even further, killing children, and the Algerians then respond with a further escalation.By incorporating women and children, Ali and his cohorts weave themselves into the fabric of their society. The women are handled in a particularly interesting way. A far cry from the two-dimensional arm-candy found in big budget Hollywood productions, these women neither sit passively at home, keeping the fire going for their men, nor do they behave like macho caricatures. In one particularly affecting sequence, three women each put on makeup, color their hair, and adopt western dress in order to head into the French zone and plant bombs. The women are variously fierce, or appear to have their hearts pounding in fear, each according to her own temperament. The intensity of their desperation for self-determination is palpable, even after so many years of occupation. Despite this, the director does not hesitate to show who is going to be killed by the bombs they plant. Many of these people are innocent or unknowing, like the small child with ice cream, or the teenagers happily dancing to music. When the bombs go off, there is panic, and shattered bodies are carried out \u0096 once again, violence has begotten violence.The French response is to continue to bring a sort of 'scientific' pressure to bear. Colonel Mathieu (played by Jean Martin \u0096 interestingly this is the only major role played by a professional actor) is completely impassive and unemotional in his approach, treating the FLN as a problem to be solved. He requires of his superiors that they allow him to abandon all humanity and brutalize any captive, as needed. He is thus delighted when he is given an 'excuse' to pen the Algerians into the Casbah, like rabbits. His every move is polished and calculated, and he even laments, \"Why are the Sartres always born on the other side?\" The French are shown destroying shops \u0096 and then handing out loaves of bread. Surely there is no more striking illustration of how colonialism functions than that one. When he captures the rebel leader, he allows him to speak to the press, but only for long enough to make the point that he has been seized \u0096 he ends the interview before he begins to engender too much sympathy. His theory about the rebels is in fact in some respects accurate: violence does not win wars \u0096 the goal of the FLN is to show the populace at large that it is possible to resist. During the scene where Colonel Mathieu alludes to his own capture by Nazis in WWII, one wants to shout at the screen. Did he learn nothing from his experiences? Has he not found any compassion at all? The haunting sound of ululations ringing out in grief over the city suggests that it is perhaps this very element, the compassion of the Algerian people for one another, that ultimately enables them to oust the French, despite their superior, scientific tactics and their sophisticated weaponry.

It is an unbiased film about a revolution that is started by the Algerians against the French who've occupied the country of Algeria and captures how quickly physical revolutionary tactics can turn into horrific terrorist acts, but nothing that we haven't seen already in the US and around the world. The revolution started by the NLF organization, which is doomed to become the 'terrorist' organization fairly quickly, kicks off the uprising by killing French police, then innocent French people on the streets and escalating to bombing entire innocent French hangouts. But they don't progress without retaliation from the French government. Both sides use fairly convincing justifications for their actions. Many questions are raised but conclusions are left for the viewers to insert.It is a classic war between the suppressed and the suppressors, the weak and the powerful, the more civil and lawfully awful, but what's more to this movie is that those labels can shift throughout scene to scene and that's when the analogies start forming with our situation here today in the US and around the world, becoming all the more exciting to watch. At times of war, rules are broken, policies are changed or rewritten, the humanity of each side is questioned, and powers are abused. So keep you eye glued and ear undisturbed.What I found astounding about this movie is that after watching the movie you can follow up on the movie to see what has happened after the revolution over 40 years later and you'll see that just as recently as Dec. 11, 2007 there were terrorists attacks in Algeria but this time it's not against the French but against their own people, just as one of the NLF leaders in the movie forecast about the state of Algiers after the revolution has ended, stating that chaos could continue long after.

There is no blatant attempt to garner favor for the NLF (National Liberation Front) by showing oppressed Algierians. The French Colonialists are not shown as the evil oppressive outsiders. Col. Mathieu, who leads the anti-terrorist task force, is just a good soldier. He follows orders, he accomplishes his goal. Does he hate the terrorists or what they stand for or is he there doing his job? I think this is summed up when he replies to the reporters questions about his brutal tactics. \"Should we remain in Algeria? If you answer \"yes,\" then you must accept all the necessary consequences.\" Ben M'hidi plays the voice of the NLF's conscience. He does not pander for the audiences acceptance of their violent tactics, but explains in plain clear terms why they do what they do. \"Acts of violence don't win wars. Neither wars nor revolutions. Terrorism is useful as a start. But then, the people themselves must act. That's the rationale behind this strike: to mobilize all Algerians, to assess our strength.\" Yes there are heart wrenching scenes and brutality shown on both sides of the war, no power is given to either side by the filmmakers. The French are in a superior position, making the Algerians the underdog. So there may seem to be a lean towards the native Algerians, but that is mostly a state of mind. This film forces you to make a decision on a very hard topic; by making the characters neither inherently evil or good and the actions understandable if not agreeable.

The French bring in military might, but the guerrilla tactics of the rebels prevent direct assault. Thus the French officials are left with an unclear path of bringing order to the city. The film chronicles individual terrorist plots and attacks, while also describing the attempts of the French army to react and hunt down rebel power. The small attacks slowly build up into a brilliant, touching conclusion.The person that stood out the most was Colonel Mathieu, a confident and cunning head of the French military. He made an admirable character from his first appearance in a paratrooper march to his final statement. The rebels meet our expectations; there are a few major rebel figures, but none of them have the unanimous command like Colonel Mathieu. They are also imperfect. The plans are drawn up quickly, but the goal is always the same: to stimulate Algeria's resistance to French command. Overall, it makes for an uncannily realistic plot structure.The film is loaded with material and messages that will keep you thinking long after watching it. It is not the usual well-defined revolution that we expect; rather, the rebels are terrorists whose bombs kill innocent people, while the French army is very orderly and (despite torturing prisoners) civilized. Neither side is perfect, and its hard to tell what side is right. This makes for a highly realistic vision that is as complex as it is political.The only major downside to the film is that, although filmed professionally, the quality of the footage and sound is not always the best.

This is a very good recreation of a true story about a country of people who will go to all means to bring about their independence including terrorist bombings on innocent people to get their point across. For us, it's initially hard to determine who are the good guys and who are the bad guys because both groups use similar methods to try and control the other group. The movie starts in the middle of the conflict(it's really not a typical battle) at a point where a member of the rebellion after being tortured gives away the hiding place of the last leaders in the city of Algiers. It then goes backwards to the beginnings of the rebellion and kind of shows how the main core of the group is formed and where they came from. There is an obvious slant toward the Algerian rebels despite some of their not so kosher cleansing process and terrorism tactics, but their oppression from the French government is shown as needed to be toppled at any means. The movie then continues up through the initial scene until the eventual independence that occurs, but not without many casualties. This realistic, documentary-like movie does not back away from actual violence and it's after-effects, but keeps us interested with a linear American-like story.

Hoberman, The Village Voice's resident film reviewer, described \"The Battle of Algiers\", Gillo Pontecorvo's Golden Lion-winner at the 1966 Venice International Film Festival, as the \"revolutionary du jour\". I have to agree. Completely.Everything in the film could and should inspire ferocious and deeply-rooted ideologies and sentiments pertaining to one's own nation's freedom, independence and basic human rights.The film is already four-decades old and the subject that it depicts, the Algerian people's struggle for liberation and self-determination against the French colonial government during the mid-'50s, can be rightfully considered as an integral part of modern history, but even when viewed from today's vantage point (as in my case) it still manages to unsettle and stun, to provoke and inspire. \"The Battle of Algiers\" possesses such staggering turmoil and realism that, as the events gradually unfold towards the nationwide street revolution, one can't help but be wide-eyed and unnerved throughout the film's 2-hour running time.It works well to the film's advantage that it has managed to acquire through time an uncanny sense of historical immediacy. It feels as if Pontecorvo were still alive today working as a TV news reporter or documentarist recording with his own camera the incendiary real-life events right before our very own eyes. The Dziga Vertov principle of \"life caught unawares\" has moved onto a new level of meaning. It now becomes an almost-impossible task to draw the line between fiction and documentary, between what is staged and what is actual, if there really is such a distinction.In my humble knowledge, no other highly-political film of World Cinema during those times and after has come close to the feral neo-realist energy of \"The Battle of Algiers\"--not even Costa-Gavra's \"Z\", \"Missing\" and \"Amen\", not even Francis Coppola's \"Apocalypse Now\", not even \"L'America\" (Amelio), \"The Mission\" (Joffe), \"World Apart\" (Menges), \"Bloody Sunday\" (Greengrass), not even our own \"Orapronobis\" (Brocka), just to name a handful.What can even be more baffling--and thus put one more notch higher the film's above-mentioned quality--for today's viewers is how \"The Battle of Algiers\" can put in context today's headline-hogging and highly-relevant spate of \"political terrorism\", international and local. As \"outsiders\" having to become aware of the headlines mainly by means of TV or newspaper, it has become a necessary habit (justified or otherwise) to regard these bombings, assassinations, insurrections and any other forms of \"terroristic\" acts as a work of pure evil and inhumanity. This is for the reason that what we, the spectators, get to encounter immediately is the outcome, the damages done, of the event in question (the what and the how). More often than not, we don't get the opportunity to dig deep into the ideologies and motivations that led to the act (the why). If we ever had the chance to know the raison d'etre of the act, most likely the account is biased or blurred, thus further fuelling our \"prejudices\".The numerous bombing incidents in the film (as well as the attacks on the French officials), mostly at the cost of innocent lives and in broad daylight, can be a sure cause of alarm, considering that these events essentially ring true as to what's being delivered from today's news. But as director Pontecorvo and writer Franco Solinas take pains to give an objective account of the Algerian struggle for liberation and independence--or of the Algerian insurrection, popularly known as the Front Liberation de Nationale (FLN), if one takes the liberty to use an \"extreme\" description--we get to come to the knowledge that these extreme measures used by the Algerian nationals could be the only possible way to attain an extreme goal, otherwise unimaginable through \"simple\" and \"humble\" acts (like the local prohibition of vices associated with the colonial government, such as alcohol, drugs and prostitution).The unbiased account of the historical events is such that the high-ranking French colonial officers, during those tension-filled and critical moments (like the setting up for explosion of a resistance fighter's hideout), still get to exhibit some kind of humanity for their considered \"enemies of the state\" (\"If you want to die there, then let the children out first\", is one such line). Such \"humaneness\", though, by the very situation itself (or the description of the situation itself), gets to border on a comical awkwardness. These colonizers still manage to put a smile on our faces.An intertitle towards the film's end says that the Algerian people finally attained freedom by 1962 (not after some nationwide turmoil, bloodshed and protest, those \"unintelligible and frightening rhythmic cries\"). However, if we are to take bloody seriously the film's timeless immediacy, then the battle doesn't only stop at Algiers. It continues on and on, in another form, in another place, in another era.

Unsatisfied with remaining a colony of France, a selection of determined civilians (Brahim Hagiag, Yacef Saadi \u0096 the latter playing a fictional version of himself) form the National Liberation Front (FLN), who sought to reclaim their independence through acts of terrorism and bloody violence. The escalating bloodshed leads to the introduction of French paratroopers, led by Colonel Mathieu (believed to be a combination of real-life officers Colonel Bigeard and General Massu, and played by Jean Martin). In a bid to combat the frequent street-bombs and police officer shootings, Mathieu employs any possible means, including lynch mobs, murder and harrowing methods of torture. The colonel's justification for ordering these acts is chillingly simple: \"should we remain in Algeria? If you answer \"yes,\" then you must accept all the necessary consequences.\"Another element for which 'The Battle of Algiers' has been praised is its relative lack of bias. Though the end of the film betrays an unmistakable support for the rebels' cause (an unsurprising outcome considering that it was partially funded by the Algerian government), it is often difficult to decide for which side you should show sympathy. Perhaps it was just my post-September 11/Bali bombings mentality coming through, but, having entered the film without any background knowledge, I spent much of it cheering for the charismatic Col. Mathieu and his paratroopers, hoping that they'd quickly and efficiently destroy those cowardly, caf\u00e9-bombing terrorists. Unlike other seemingly-similar revolution pictures (such as Eisenstein's 'The Battleship Potemkin (1925)'), 'The Battle of Algiers' doesn't attempt to push any clear agenda: every character on each side possesses a staunch inability to accept defeat; every character achieves great things and every character commits acts of violence too horrifying to even imagine. There are no clear-cut heroes and villains here; everybody is a hero and everybody is a villain. This is the way that life is. This is a revolution at its most truthful.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 5, "votes": 12}, "heading": "\"We aren't madmen or sadists, gentlemen\u0085 we are soldiers and our only duty is to win.\"", "date": "2007-10-23T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1751771"}, {"content": "\"Should we remain in Algeria?

After over a country of French colonial rule, the people of Algeria are preparing to rise in revolt. The terrorist group FLN begins a rebellion with a rapidly escalating series of terrorist attacks and assassinations. The local authorities are unable to stop this faceless, increasingly ruthless enemy, and so an elite division of French paratroopers led by the coolly professional Colonel Mathieu (Jean Martin) arrives to deal with the situation. The French engage in a brutal but effective crackdown which includes mass arrests, assassination, and use of torture, which ultimately kills the FLN off. However, the people of Algeria have been inflamed, and Independence soon becomes inevitable.\"The Battle of Algiers\" is simply a brilliant movie. Gillo Pontecorvo has created one of the most stark, brutal, realistic depictions of guerrilla warfare - a film which has been viewed and used as a guide by various terrorist groups since its initial release. In abstracts rather than particulars, it is extraordinarily pertinent to the War on Terror that the US finds itself faced off against today, as America finds itself being forced to concede the moral high-ground to win a potentially unwinnable conflict.Pontecorvo's film spares no one. Every side, every group of people is shown as being nasty in its own way. While Pontecorvo's film is on the side of the FLN, it does not shy away from showing their actions, such as placing bombs inside diners and discos, killing and maiming teenagers and even children. Likewise, the French army's techniques of assassination and torture are shown as well. It's clear that from a purely moral point-of-view, neither side has the high-ground.In regards to the film's politics, I would hasten to say that it's a bit unfair to compare the situation in Iraq today with the film's setting, except in an abstract way. For while we have only recently conquered Iraq and have no intention of colonizing it, France had occupied Algeria for over a century and indeed considered it to be not just a colony, but part of France itself. That being said, in regards to the tactics of both the terrorists and the French counter-insurgents, and the never-ending cycle of vicious violence - well, it's obvious why the Pentagon screened this film as a guide on how to combat terrorism.The film's bleak, realistic visual sense gives the impression of a documentary; we feel we are really living history, not just watching a film. The violence is not particularly graphic, understandable considering the time in which it was made, but we do see at least the aftermath of mass shootings and terrorist bombings - maimed and bloody bodies and destroyed homes have their own power, even if the actual act was sublimated. There are some genuinely disturbing sequences, as when a group of Algerian children beat a drunken man to death, the montage of torture, and of course the famous scene where three Algerian women disguise themselves as Frenchwomen to carry out a series of bombings. Ennio Morricone provides a desperate, driving score which allows the message to hit home.On one last note: the cast is made up almost entirely of non-professional actors, with one notable exception. It is to the immense credit of Pontecorvo and screenwriter Franco Solinas that they made the film's antagonist, Colonel Mathieu, not a typical fascist-type monster, but an immensely sympathetic, refined man who would rather not be doing these nasty things, but recognizes he has to. His scenes where he addresses the press about the tactics of the paratroops (another scene which could be ripped from the headlines today), and his one-to-one talks with captured terrorist leaders, show that he is a genuinely decent man making the best of a bad situation. Jean Martin, a celebrated stage actor whose film appearances are generally less-than-memorable (\"My Name is Nobody\" and \"Day of the Jackal\"), turns in a truly astounding performance. The cast of amateur actors is equally impressive, particularly Ali la Pointe, the fiery rebel leader who is a man of action more than ideas, perfectly played by Brahim Haigag.It is impossible to understate the importance of \"The Battle of Algiers\". As a primer for both terrorists and counter-terrorists, it continues to be one of the most politically influential movies ever made. Thirty years later, with the US engaged in a vicious struggle against terrorism, the topics covered in the film are as pertinent as ever.10/10", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Unflinchingly graphic, brutal, and honest depiction of guerrilla warfare and terrorism", "date": "2007-09-06T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1725836"}, {"content": "Fredrich Engels the Communist theoretician once said that so many factors shape an event that what emerges is something no one might have expected. PBS replayed last night the Algerian made fast paced movie The Battle of Algers, a docudrama of the Algerian struggle for independence, released shortly after the event in 1965 when the right saw the Algerian war as a communist inspired take over and the left saw it as a struggle for national liberation. True to Engle's axiom neither was correct. What emerged was the phenomena of Arab or Islamic nationalism, the most recent product of which left a big crater in NYC; former Russian communists also do battle with this phenomena. Hedonistic liberals enchanted with national liberation in 1962 need not sit back in self satisfaction; today the phenomena hates liberalism more than it ever did colonialism.The tactics of the Algerians would be recognised instantaneously to the casual reader of war news from Irak. Indeed President Bush might have been well advised to have studied the movie carefully before embarking on his wars in Afghanistan and Irak.The movie takes an Algerian perspective but is fair to French Colonel Mathieu whose tactics put down FLN's uprising.

Few films are as emotionally and intellectually stirring, and complex. The film follows Ali La Pointe (Brahim Hadjadj) as he joins and eventually attempts to lead the FLN in the Algerian revolt against French colonial power. Opening with the end we see La Pointe hiding in the wall of a FLN hideout as an FLN member tips off the French army as to where he is hiding. The French Colonel Mathieu (Jean Martin) is standing on the other side of the wall he is hiding in warning him that he has to come out or he will be forced to blow up the building, killing everyone inside. Then Pontecorvo brings the audience back to before La Pointe joined the FLN. This gives the film a hunting residue of looming failure, a pure sense of hopelessness for the rebels you are pulling for. Or at least the rebels I was pulling for. Part of the beauty of Pontecorvo's portrayal of the rebellion is that it isn't one-sided; it doesn't attempt to say the rebels were right and deserved their independence and the French were occupying dictators. It tends to lean that way, but the portrayal is much more complex than that. Both sides kill innocents in an attempt to seek revenge against those who have injured innocents on their side. The audience relates to, and respects, La Pointe and the FLN, while despising their methods. At the same time you can respect Mathieu and the French for their attempts to end things peacefully and the respect Mathieu shows for the FLN leaders he captures, in private and in the press. Taking in equal parts from the Italian Neo-Realistic tradition and the 60s cinema verite school, the film alternates between gritty footage of the FLN roaming the city streets, plotting and planning their revolt. Humanizing and immortalizing them. Then the footage jarringly rotates to more documentary style footage of Algerians in the streets, striking, protesting or roaming the markets of Algiers. Shot in a, sometimes, grainy black and white the film finds beauty in rawness and jarring, rough shots, finds beauty in the hideous and the luscious. Every bombing, interview, jail, city street or hole in the wall carries a dark, sweeping, beauty that the audience doesn't have to search to find. Easily one of the best films on wartime politics and on revolutionaries ever made. It's haunting, the kind of film that will stick with you for days, leaving you grappling with moral complexities and desiring to determine a more definite sense of self. This is what cinema should be. It can be hard to communicate when a film is this good in an era when criticism lends itself towards the sensational and the linguistically fluid for even the tritest trash film, but this, this is a powerfully moving film. A mix of the raw and harsh eye of Cassavetes, the violently prophetic scenarios of Scorsese and the morally marginalizing notions of Kubrick at his best. An absolute must-see for anyone who considers himself, or herself, a fan, not of film, but of cinema.

But on the other hand, it's disturbing to think that the same patterns have been repeating themselves for ages and we as a race just keep making the same blunders over and over again.\"The Battle of Algiers\" chronicles in near documentary fashion the struggle of the Algerian Muslims against the imperialist French rule in the 1950s. Overwhelmed by the might and resources of the French military, a rebel group of Algerians resort to terrorist tactics to make themselves heard. Stuck in the middle are the everyday Algerian and French citizens, who die in bombings and attacks perpetrated by both sides, and are fed propaganda explaining how each side is working in their best interests.There's a scene mid-way through the film in which a French military commander lectures a gathering on the personalities and philosophies of terrorist cells. He explains the terrorist cell structure, and how the best way to kill the cell is to cut off its head. Sound familiar? Pontecorvo's film is engrossing, and one that will always (sadly) be relevant. His sympathies obviously reside with the Algerians -- the film ends with images of an Algerian uprising that occurred two years after the main events depicted in the movie, with Algerian people celebrating in the streets, waving flags and shouting cries of \"freedom,\" \"liberty\" and such.

But I was really mistaken! \"La Battaglia di Algeri\" is a sober but deeply moving film. It portrays the fight of the Algerian people against the french for their freedom. Even if the film tries not to take sides, it is clear from the beginning that the french (short of employing nazi or israeli tactics) were fighting a losing battle, because they were fighting against a rising nation.The film describes the first beginnings of the FLN (front of national liberation) in 1954, how it grows from a small group of people to an organized movement and eventually wins the Algerian people to their side. The escalation of violence on both sides - the FLN organizing terrorist attacks in restaurants, airport, on the streets, that leave many casualties and the french police and army replying with bombings, torture and trigger-happy shootings on the streets. After each french repression shock, singing, shouting and cries for freedom arise from the arab quarters.

The Battle Of Algiers may be more relevant today than it was in 1966, though the situations we face today are different to some degree, it's uncomfortably close to what we're seeing every night on cable news. This is one of those movies that everyone has heard about, but fewer have seen.Filmed in a neorealist semi-documentary style, which was striking in the '60s but less impressive today, the film has the feel of old news footage, and to modern audiences unused to such a look, it might be hard to distinguish. Besides the obvious visual style and lack of professional actors, American audiences would now, as they have in the past, find it difficult to respond to a film that does not offer a clear/cut black and white storyline. Though it makes somewhat of an effort to portray both sides, the filmmakers sentiments are clearly on the side of the Algerian national resistance movement. This is one area that might raise a lot of questions. Obviously the issue of Algerian independence and its struggle cannot be recounted in a 2, 3 or 10 hour movie and it would take about 1,000 interviews with players of both sides for an outsider like an American to form any type of semi valid opinion about the events.Lately the catchword in the U.S. is \"I support the troops,\" though the ones who say it never can give a satisfactory response as to what it means. Supporting the Paras in Algeria obviously meant supporting their temporarily successful methods, that is, torturing suspects for information. For this film to make a statement on that it could have used more graphic scenes. The use of torture and savage methods by the French Army, while proving successful in Algiers, cost them the support of the French people and led to the downfall of the government, so it was a two edged sword which Americans should pay attention to. I think the entire issue should have been recounted here in more detail.While the subject matter is even more timely today, the film making style is not, but anyone interested in current events as well as the history of Arab nationalism and revolutionary movements would be interested in this.

Gillo Pontecorvo's film was released in 1966 and provides a documentary-style portrait of events.

The French retaliate and there is a curfew, searches, road-blocks and torture. The French try to break the resistance movement and ordinary Arabs are attacked in the street. The FLN then kill French civilians by planting bombs in bars and caf\u00e9s. The film shows that ratcheting up the violence just begets more extreme violence from the other side.Many European countries faced similar conflicts as they were forced to abandon their colonies after World War II. As a Brit I'm familiar with the narrative of an unpopular foreign power deciding how much violence to use to put down an insurgency. The UK usually decided that it was better to get out than engage in a guerrilla war with a hostile local population. The movie gives the impression that the French had some difficulty in accepting that the world had moved on and their time as a colonial power was up. Ironically, Jacques Chirac, the French president who opposed the Iraq war, served as an officer in the conflict and was wounded in action. The film's sympathies are clearly with the FLN and the film's happy ending is independence in 1962. However since independence Algeria has often been violent and unstable. By 1976 the FLN had turned the country into a virtual one-party state and banned dissent. When elections resumed in 1991, the Islamic Salvation Front were the winners. This was unacceptable to the military and in 1992 a 10-year civil war began, with 160,000 deaths.

Still, as a descendant of the colonized (and quite possibly the colonizer, too) it's hard not to get affected by what could very well be the greatest anti-colonialism film ever made. Something as potent and political as this demands a reaction. \"Algiers\" is among a handful of films that are so exceptional and humanistic they ought to qualify as required viewing for a better humanity: Mira Nair's \"Salaam Bombay\", Koreeda Hirokazu's \"Nobody Knows\", Kieslowski's \"The Decalogues\", and Lee Chang-Dong's \"Oasis\", to cite a few.'Two hours' and 'black & white' aren't the most appetizing words even to the most adventurous of cineastes but here the story is quite absorbing, the work paced well, and the mood of resistance so palpable, one barely notices the film's length. Algeria's National Liberation Front (FLN) and one of its top leaders, Ali La Pointe (real name Ali Ammar?), are the obvious protagonists and, despite what some reviewers say, it's very clear that the colonizer, France, is the devil here. It's in the employment of war tactics where it gets blurry. Both parties resort to violence and murder for entirely different reasons, the Algerians' nobler than that of the French, but does purpose supersede the moral dilemma? Does the struggle for freedom justify murder?Despite the quandary, it's quite easy to root for the Algerians especially when they're led by a reformed petty crook-turned-revolutionary. \"Algiers\" is a classic underdog film with a heavy dose of historical credibility. In other words, \"It happened!\" We repeatedly see the Algerian 'rebel' forces getting crushed by France's more superior military forces and it's very commendable and heartbreaking to see them fight back over and over again. And how. It's astonishing to finally witness the film's legendary realism. I actually cried at some point when Ali's situation seemed very bleak.The history of colonization and oppression is naturally full of fascinating stories of rebels and revolutionaries, loyalties are tested, courage is in high demand, traitors abound, nationalism is in action. Sometimes I wonder how fellow Filipinos and I would've acted back then under Spanish oppression. Books I'm sure barely do justice to these crucial moments in history (not mention distort the truth rampantly) so to see a chunk of it staged in a very realistic manner on film is quite poignant for me. \"Battle of Algiers\" is easily among the most well-made films I've ever seen, heavy yet accessible, a well-deserved film icon that is still being talked about long after 1966 and will be so well beyond 2006.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 6}, "heading": "Still Highly Relevant\u0097If Not More So\u0097Iconic Resistance Film Attacks Colonialism", "date": "2006-09-19T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1478927"}, {"content": "The Battle of Algiers is one of the greatest pieces of cinematic history. Unarguably the leader of its genre - war/politics - each frame of this masterpiece is cinemagic.Based on Saadi Yacef's biased memoirs, but done in a much more neutral manner by Italian communist filmmaker Gillo Pontecorvo, this has a marked Neorealistic influence stamped on it. From the opening frame when an Algerian is tortured into revealing the whereabouts of Ali La Pointe and the movement of the paramilitary into the casbah to nab/kill the FLN leader, you'll know this is the real McCoy. There gritty realism, the amazing crowd scenes, the hustle-bustle, squalor and beauty of the Casbah weave a cinematic magic.The bulk of the action takes place during the eventful year of 1957 in what started out as a gentlemen's war but eventually degenerated into all out civilian bombings when the French played dirty by planting a bomb in the casbah. The FLN retaliation is swift and brilliantly executed - disturbing though it is. The tactics used by the FLN and French Army as shown in this film have been studied for years by various terrorist organizations (especially the PLO) and by governments (including the Pentagon).There are so many wonderful moments in this film that you get sucked into another world, another time from the word Go! It is wonderfully watchable and intelligent at the same time. The dialogue is superb too - especially Ben MHidi's \"Give us your bombers, and you can have our baskets.\" In real life, the vastly experienced Ben MHidi - an elder of the movement - was in his early 30's when he \"committed suicide\" so that gives you an idea of the youth of the FLN support base.Unmissable!!!", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 5}, "heading": "One of the crowning achievements of cinema", "date": "2006-09-19T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1478553"}, {"content": "\"The Battle of Algiers\" is a film that everyone should see.

It follows him episodically from his teenage years, to his joining the FLA (the Algerian Independence group) and follows many of his terrorist exploits as well as those of his compatriots. However, despite this being the focus, the film then diverges towards other characters and even after Ali's death, the film continues--giving spotty accounts all the way up until their independence in 1962. While the film is greatly admired and it does seem to show both sides of the equation, it looks as if the film was made by two or more directors and then pieced together, as the focus and style of the film changed repeatedly.

It's not without saying though that once the film was over, and watching a bit more on the extra features on the DVD (with other directors shining light on their opinions on the film), that most of what I saw sunk in a little deeper. This is one of the best kinds of documentary-style dramas made in its time and place in the world, and goes a bit further in the right direction from Roberto Rossellini's post-war trilogy. While it's not unlikely to see Pontecorvo's own influence from the neorealist maverick, it's also likely to see how Pontecorvo takes this very emotionally charged, as-factual-as-possible story of Algiers versus France in the mid 1950s with an assured balance of pathos and style. It also works tremendously as a kind of 'statement' movie, without at all pushing it down the viewer's throats. It does have a viewpoint, as do most films, and here and there it definitely does drive home the point of the Algiers' need for freedom from the militant oppression of France.But what struck me most about how Pontecorvo and his collaborators (both screenwriter and producer as the latter of which had complete first hand contact with the events and plays an acting part), is how he approached violence and its effect on an urban climate. Through Pontecorvo's camera, we see the ugly side to both sides, even the one that we should be rooting for. France is the (supposedly unintentional) oppressor here, and in this time frame had made them a colonial power for decades, and in order to sustain order and track down their 'targets' in 1957 they go from complete militarization (shown quite starkly and simply, and like a good would-be neorealist 'as it is if we are right there') to torture tactics. Their acts of violence and brutality are however given the other side of the coin in the scenes where the lieutenant Colonel of the French troops Matthieu (played by the great Jean Martin) talks to the press or lays out his point of view in scenes. Then the other side of the Algiers, those who are fighting back early on in the film with guerrilla-like terrorist tactics go to lengths to make their messages clear through seemingly random but daunting acts of violence. Pontecorvo's point in showing both sides is almost complex while seeming simple- neither side is right when it comes to committing violence against one another in this situation. It's a very powerful statement made that doesn't cut corners, of the truth that still permeates of a first-world power, already very adept in their military powers from past (proud) military conflicts who can't seem to let up from giving the people they say they want to help and provide some leeway in establishing their own government and freedom despite the fervent opposition. Sound familiar?At any rate, the real success behind this message- which could've been done on the flip-side with a lot of pumped melodrama- is by making it a kind of hybrid of doc and fiction. Unlike Memories of Underdevelopment, which would come out 2 years after this in Cuba, it's never exactly certain when the footage is even dramatized or not. And there are two aspects to what Pontecorvo covers in his purely cinematic style that totally serves his content. One is how he deals with crowds, with the dirty city life of the Arab section of Algiers where all the madness, chaos, and just frustration takes place, in range from the scenes of people walking by in burkas to reveal themselves as the \"enemy\" with guns, to those startling sequences of the revolutions and multi-militant post. The other one is how Pontecorvo deals with his 'subjects', as one might call them, as they are all save for one non-actors. Like directors before him (mentioned above) and after (like Fernando Meirelles) the filmmaker here is after the right look on people, and in going almost as a bystander at times getting these people. The guy playing La Pointe- the center of the film (an illiterate petty criminal turned major terrorist)- isn't particularly 'good', but he doesn't need to be. His face tells all. In maybe my favorite scene in the film, when a female from the Algiers section sneaks into a quasi-dance hall in the European section, we get various shots of the faces of the patrons as well as her own. None are professional, which obviously adds to the complexities of this scene. Who's innocent and who's guilty in this world? Sometimes there are some very brutal moments in the film, and then there are others that sometimes even work just as a usual, well, thriller. Here and there I almost felt like I was watching a more recent film without taking into account how it might have influenced a few directors over time. With one of his best early scores via Ennio Morricone, and some uncompromising details with the multiple deaths in the film, The Battle of Algiers does come quite close to being one of those 'essential' films of the 1960's, where a political attitude or need to put onto film a time and place in the world was captured. And if it has at least a little relevance for some military-style situations of the now (and I am not at all anti-US, but the comparisons could be made with bits in the film) its a credit to the filmmakers that its basically the film they wanted to make, with a freedom relatable to the doomed characters on the side of Algiers.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 6}, "heading": "as fitting a tip-of-the-hat to Rossellini's post-WW2 work made in the 60's, and them some", "date": "2006-06-03T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1385052"}, {"content": "The War in Algeria, like most revolutionary wars, was surely a tragedy for all concerned... for the Algerian people, for the French soldiers who fought and died bravely in yet another war they were not allowed to win, civilians on both sides whose lives were destroyed by the carnage and upheaval.

They are written in no particular order) One thing that is amazing about La Bataglia d'Algeri (or The Battle of Algiers) is how amazingly well it lures you into caring so much exactly what happens to its Muslim Revolutionaries while giving them little to no screen time. The main character \"Ali La Pointe\" hardly says anything throughout the entire film, but we sit on the edge of our seats wondering what will happen to him next.The film was made by Italian director Gillo Pontecorvo, with the enormous cooperation of the Algerian government. Pontecorvo also hired Italian composer Ennio Morricone for scoring the film's music, which is based on traditional Muslim folk songs (Pontecorvo had been impressed with Morricone's score for \"A Few Dollars More\") One of the main actors of the film, Saadi Yacef, essentially played himself under a different name, and was also the one who wrote the autobiographical book on which the film was based. The film was shot in documentary style black and white, hand-held looking. One of the more amazing things about this film is that not a single bit of documentary or newsreel footage was used in this film, which the credits points out. Its almost hard to believe the whole film isn't a documentary. You see shots of bombs going off at derby's that look so realistic you wonder how dangerous they are.The film was nominated for Oscars for best director, screenplay, and foreign film. It also won the FIPRESCI prize and Golden Lion at the Venice film festival. It was banned in France upon its release (surprise!) It was screened for the Pentagon's staff in 2003 because of its uncanny parallels to the current War in Iraq.The film follows, from 1954 to the liberation of Algeria, the attempts by the native Muslims, who are confined to their own quarter (the \"Casbah\"). Racism against Muslims and those of darker skin is incredibly high in Algeria, one of the films most disturbing scenes involves a shooting of a police officer. Tenants of an apartment building poke their heads out of the windows, hearing the sirens, and point at a random old Muslim beggar (who did not commit the crime) and yell \"it's him! it's him!\" soon it seems everyone on the street is screaming at him, yelling racial epithets, pointing at him. Terrified, the man runs for his life and is arrested by a passing police car. Reading a report on him, the police chief takes some friends with him and plants a bomb outside his wife's house in the Casbah. The blast kills many people, and the Muslim's retaliate. Three women disguise themselves as Westerers to get past the check point. Another one of the more chilling scenes involves the women, each carrying a bomb in their hand baskets, examining their would be victims. A child eating ice cream? A bunch of teenagers dancing to pop music? Relatives visiting some friends in Algeria? The film does lean towards the Muslims, probably justly so. But is mostly a non biased film that manages to play its mournful theme on the bombing of a Western caf\u00e9 as well.Eventually the paratroopers are brought in to crush the opposition, and the character of Colonel Mathieu is played by the only major French actor who would work on this film, Jean Martin. Martin mostly acted on stage, this was his first major film role. He was strongly against the French in Algeria and cheerfully agreed to do this film. He plays a chilling character perfectly, carefully avoiding the use of the word \"torture\" so his methods of interrogation don't sound too harsh.Ever since the War in Iraq this film came out in a special 3 disc special edition DVD set, digitally remastered by Rialto, along with a booklet describing the history of the actual revolution and the making of the film.

Again the main source is Alistair Horne's book \"A savage war of peace\". Alistair Horne wrote a trilogy of books on 20th century French history incorporating Verdun, the fall of France in 1940 and the Algerian war. Although Britain also had an empire it seemed to be able to extricate itself from it in a less bloody manner and those colonies that did see conflict did not see the kind of bloodshed France experienced in Vietnam and Algeria. I think Britain was able to see that the concept of empire was politically, militarily, economically and morally unviable. The French did not seem to see it that way. Alistair Horne wrote that the French seemed to think that if the rebellion was repressed they could carry on ruling Algeria like Ian Smith's Rhodesia or apartheid era South Africa, a totally unrealistic option. I suppose all whites have to accept that attitudes were much more racist in that era which explains a lot. Also I suspect that after the humiliation of 1940 the French military were determined to win a battle. What is not generally known is that most of the Free French troops that fought in Italy and France in 1943/45 were from French north Africa. The brutal battle of Cassino in Italy was brought to a conclusion by these colonial troops making an outflanking manoeuvre over mountainous terraine. Most of the troops liberating Paris were colonial. The natives were liberating the mother country and many of them later led the FLN. French dissatisfaction with the ongoing war led in 1958 to General Charles De Gaulle being called out of 12 years of retirement. Most Frenchmen expected De Gaulle to crush the FLN but De Gaulle was a statesman not a 3rd rate politician and could see that long term France had to let Algeria go. When this became clear the French military in Algeria felt betrayed and astonishly tried to stage a coup d'etat in mainland France. It failed of course and many rebel officers went underground and formed a terrorist group called the OAS which murdered people in both mainland France and Algeria. The coup attempt was a PR disaster and most French people now wanted out of Algeria.As independence for Algeria approached the OAS atrocities in the country made the situation untenable for the white colonist population after majority rule arrived. A million white colonists, many born and bred in Algeria fled for mainland France abandoning everything they owned and worked for in an incredible mass exodus. It was a retreat for western civilisation as villages and churches were abandoned to decay to be consumed by the majority Muslim culture. The OAS continued their campaign of terror in France, attempting to assassinate De Gaulle. And this of course inspired Frederick Forsythe to write the book \"The Day of the Jackal\", later a film. So whilst I feel sorry for the colonists who lost everything, their advocacy of \"Algerie Francais\" against a tide of De-colonisation was un-realistic and un-workable and led France and Algeria into a brutal and costly conflict.

Heavily inspired by the Italian neo-realist movement, Director Pontecorvo used hundreds of non-actors and shot the entire film on location. This all adds to the documentary like photography with which the account is presented, setting it apart from all other war films, imbuing the action with a shocking sense of realism comparable to a news report of a real terrorist demonstration. Despite being a docu-film on the Algerian insurrection against the French, a conflict that has long been resolved, the film still remains extremely significant today, particularly due to the current American occupation of Iraq.Although I enjoy and appreciate more mainstream war films such as Apocalypse Now and Platoon, The Battle Of Algiers uncovers the pointlessness of conflict and the harsh repercussions of it, like no other war film I have seen. Taking a deliberately impartial stance, the torture based methods of interrogation employed by the French troops are juxtaposed with the violent terrorist attacks of the Algerians. This powerfully illustrates the destruction caused by both sides, and how their tactics, although different in nature, are united in their ugliness and betrayal of humanitarian values, causing nothing but death and suffering. In this respect, the film documents like no other the sad foolishness of trying to solve conflicts with violence, causing maximum loss on both sides, perpetuating conflict rather than preventing it. The Battle Of Algiers is also instrumental in emphasising how the actions of an extremist group using violent methods, can result in a racial hatred of an entire ethnic minority.

To say this film represents both sides is not true. The French, supposedly the more civilized country, looked down upon the Algerians and as the violence started coming from the Algerians, the French escalated their violence (in absolutely appalling methods) thereby increasing the Algerians' violence. Would the French have responded to calm, reasoning with the Algerians? I don't think so. The British did not respond to the colonies' plea for release; it took a Revelutionary War to do that. Is revolution only acceptable to Americans if we do it but not good if other countries do it? Would slavery have been abolished if not for the Civil War? I don't think so.

We are shown the deliberate and determined way in which they target civilians through acts of terrorism, and the way that they turn against their fellow Algerians when they won't join the struggle (or won't dress or act the way they are told to).Ultimately there are no good guys per se, and Pontecorvo is careful to show the brutality and the suffering of both sides of the conflict. Some of the French participants are portrayed as cardboard villains, but there are some subtler figures as well, particularly the French colonel who remarks that he dislikes Sartre, but \"likes him even less as an enemy.\"The subjects being shot are all non-professional actors (with one exception) and frequently they are acting out a second time what they actually did in real life some few years earlier. Their simple presence on screen is powerful, and Potecorvo's way of seeing them combines grainy, documentary realism with astounding moments of visual poetry. There are shots in this film that have a magic Bresson would envy.The main gift this film gives to Western viewers is an opportunity to see struggling (and non-white, non-Western) nations as the heroes of their own story, rather than as bit players in a story about the triumph of the US and Europe. This point of view will be an invaluable one in the decades to come; we'll need it to make new allies, as well as to defend against new enemies. Battle of Algiers reminds us that the desire to create one's own destiny (or the destiny of one's nation) is a human quality and not an American one.If you couldn't care less about the politics, you can take Battle of Algiers as a complex portrait of human nature in the modern era: courageous and noble, but also brutal and ruthless. Or, if that's still too highbrow for you, just watch it as an exciting and realistic war movie that makes Saving Private Ryan look Hollywood fake by comparison.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 3}, "heading": "a perfect docudrama with no equals", "date": "2005-09-13T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1172001"}, {"content": "The Battle of Algeria (1965) was a great film documenting the story of the struggle of freedom fighters who jump started the road to independence for the native people of Algeria. For years, Algerians were denied their own self identity under French colonial rule. The people were impoverished and lacked self confidence. A group of underground rebels wanted to change all that so they waged a guerrilla war against the French occupiers. Although the rebels were eventually crushed and wiped out, the people never forgot their bravery. A few years later, the French eventually left Algeria for good.The movie is not about the success of the freedom fighters. Sure they were crushed but their spirit live on. The oppressed natives rose and drove the French out. Many directors have copied from this film either style wise or certain scenes (check out the eighties flick RED DAWN, the later half of that movie was lifted from BATTLE OF ALGERIA.) The director shot this movie as a docu-drama. You'll feel for the street thug turned freedom fighter. At first glance he seems like a ordinary punk trying to save his own skin. But you get to see his transformation on screen. You'll also feel for the French general, he sympathizes with the enemy because he too was partisan during W.W.II (a theme also found in RED DAWN). The politics of this movie are pretty much left of center. People have criticized this film for glorifying a group a radical extremist Muslims turn there country into a back word country. But you must realize the director is more concerned about the idea of freedom and self identity. Repression is no fun. People should not be colonized by those who perceive themselves to be \"saviors\" or enlighten persons of the cloth. There was no reason why France held on to Algeria for so long.

There are striking similarities between the film and recent events in the American-led war on terror. As a matter of fact, this film portrays the inherent paradoxes of terrorism in such a clear way that one can only wish that it captivated a wider audience -particularly among policy-makers. The boundaries between freedom-fighter and terrorist are cleverly blended leaving it up to the viewer which side to pick. This is no Hollywood flick so the moral choice is not served to us on a silver platter. Both sides are guilty of war crimes.Naturally the film works on many levels and will certainly be enjoyed by the film buff as well as anyone interested in wider political issues. The soundtrack deserves specific mentioning, coming as it does from the maestro Ennio Morricone himself.The film gives an inside account of the tough decisions policy-makers are forced to make on a daily basis when it comes to foreign occupation.

This film depicts the struggles of the Algerians against the French who have occupied Algiers for many decades. The focus of the film is on the start of a rebellion and the pivotal characters in the rebellion, it follows the rebellion through riots, torture, and needless killings until the leaders of the rebellion are killed themselves. However even though the leaders of the rebellion have died, the rebellion is reborn a few years later and the Algerians successfully gain their independence. The film contains a high emotional and intellectual impact. It depicts the cruelty and inhumanness of both the leaders of the rebellion who gun down innocent French citizens, the French soldiers who watch emotionless as an Algiers is tortured and then later blame the Algier for not giving in sooner. In addition, the Algier is treated almost with camaraderie as the Algier is given coffee and clothes and patted on the back for him to lead the way to the rebel hideout. The film reveals the deadened almost blank expression the French soldiers depict as someone is tortured. It contrasts with the passionate, almost zealous rebels who gun down and try to run over French citizens. It is a stark contrast and yet it shows that no one is free from the devastation and destruction of the rebellion. Although the French soldiers target the rebellions, little harm was done to other Algerians initially and the French soldier Mathias appeals to a woman whose home has been occupied by the rebels to ask the rebels to give themselves up. This can be compared to the rebels who are willing to gun down and run over any one they feel are not native which includes French citizens who are attempting to make lives in Algiers. There is a sense of horrified fascination as the rebels use an ambulance to gun down French citizens who are minding their business and one of the rebels attempt to run over the French citizens. This will also share a resemblance at the end of the film where Algerians demanding their independence are gunned down by French soldiers, have bombs thrown at them, and chased by armored tanks.Although the Battle of Algiers occurred in the 1960s, the struggle for power and dominance and the need to assert power can be interpreted as universal and can occur in the present. Even though the \"war in Iraq\" began for reasons some are still unsure about whether due to weapons of mass destruction or to liberate Iraq there is a power struggle occurring. What is tragic that soldiers who believe in American and the people are Iraq are being killed because issues are not resolved peacefully. The people of Iraq are similar to the Algerians in that they are battling against people they believe are invaders and that they have the capabilities to run their own country and have their independence. Although the French and today the Americans are battling for different goals, both have invested too much time, energy, and money to leave the natives of that country alone and leave. Although the Algerians were able to gain their independence, it was not without the cost of the destruction of the country and millions of lives of the French and Algerians. Today, there is still the struggle for power and independence.

The film follows the events of the revolution in Algiers, but doesn't give you much of a story as to why it happened and so prior knowledge of the event is required from the viewer. I know practically nothing about Algiers, so this wasn't a very good aspect of the movie for me; and through it's lack of emotional connection; I can't help but think I'd have been better off watching the news or a documentary on the subject. The Battle of Algiers is unpleasant throughout, and we watch as coffee shops are blown up and the French Foreign Legion tortures the locals. Like Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer, this film begs a question of it's viewer - namely, why are you watching this? However, while Henry had the whole 'slasher' craze on it's side to help answer the question - the events in this film are far more brutal than those in Henry, and are also on a far larger scale. Not to mention far more tragic, as they definitely did actually happen. Couple this with it's lack of an emotional side; and we have the question; indeed, why ARE you watching this? It's not entertainment, that's for sure.The cinematography is very bleak and offers a stark portrayal of the events that the film is depicting. This is the film's major strong point - it looks very nice. None of the cast stands out individually, but the ensemble comes together nicely and the acting is extremely realistic, so much so that what is being depicted could easily be documentary footage. The main backbone of the film's substance focuses on the common 'war has no winners' theme that a hundred films have depicted before and after it; except even this is brought down by it's emotional void. While films such as Lewis Milestone's All Quiet on the Western Front gave you characters to feel for; The Battle of Algiers has none and even though it's message is still felt, it's not as potent as it could, and by rights should, have been. Due to the current state of the world, most notably the current mood in the USA, The Battle of Algiers can easily be used as a benchmark to draw parallels with nowadays, which in a way has given it a new lease of life in today's society.

This film covers the years from 1954 to 1962 in Algeria when the Arab section of Algiers started an uprising to fight the French and gain their own independence. Ali La Pointe (Brahim Haggiag) is a petty thief and hustler and when he gets out of jail he teams up with El-hadi Jaffar (Saadi Yacef) and together they form the Algerian National Liberation Front (FLN) in which they start terrorist attacks.*****SPOILER ALERT***** French authorities bring in Col. Mathieu (Jean Martin) to head the anti-terrorist unit and he uses methods of torture to slowly eliminate the insurrectionists who hide behind walls in apartments in the Casbah. Eventually Col. Mathieu kills Ali and it seems that everything will go back to what they were but two years later the Arabs take to the streets in huge numbers which causes the U.N. to take notice and in 1962 Algeria finally gained it's independence.This was made by Italian filmmaker Gillo Pontecorvo who shot this in the actual locations in Algeria and used mainly non-actors in his cast (Martin is the only professional) and the story is based on a book by Yacef who not only is a survivor of these true events but is cast in an important role. Pontecorvo has created a film that seems so real that he had to have a disclaimer put into the credits stating that no newsreel or documentary footage was used which is incredible because there are so many scenes in which it appears that real events were caught on film. The script does it's best to show both the positive and the negative of both sides of the French and the FLN but it does seem that Pontecorvo leans towards the side of the Arabs. This all takes place in a time when most American viewers were not aware of what terrorism was about and in 1965 it was probably easy to just point at the French and think they should just get out but now in our day and age audiences are a little more sophisticated to the world and it's politics. There are scenes that take place that we will probably never see done again because of the lack of safety especially the shots of the bombs exploding and the (so-called) actors scrambling for their lives. Another point in the film shows a French soldier bursting into an apartment to search it and accidentally stepping on a crying baby! There is no doubt that this is one of the most important films ever made not just because of the subject matter but in the skill that Pontecorvo applies to achieve his vision.

Watching THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS, it would seem this film is more documentary than cinematic fiction, and with Marcello Gatti's grainy B&W photography (many scenes filmed with a hand-held camera), this impression is not that far off the mark. Since the struggle for independence from France was so fresh in the minds of most Algerians, the participants in the actual events were used in the film, and once Pontecorvo and his team recreated the atmosphere and visuals, the emotions of the people were ignited again and suddenly they were no longer acting. While THE BATTLE OF ALGIERS does take a position on the conflict, Pontecorvo is remarkably even handed in his approach and does not shy away from difficult questions, but confronts them with brutal clarity and honesty.

It stands out as a splendid work of art, as an extremely accurate depiction of a specific time and place, as a political hymn to independence, and as a thought-provoking philosophical reflection on violence, and on the relationship between ends and means.It depicts the crucial years 1956-1957 in the Algerian war of independence from French colonial rule: the leaders of the independentist FLN decide to make Algiers a battlefield through strikes and terrorism in order to shake colonialism and to unite Algerians. The French respond to this urban guerilla with a ruthless control of space, separating European and Arab (the 'casbah') parts of the city, and with a brutal hunt of the FLN leaders through the torture of lesser militants. The French paratroops under gen. Massu, col. Bigeard and cdt. Aussaresses (blended in the film into a synthetic and fictitious character, col. Mathieu) eventually 'win' the battle of Algiers, but they end up 'losing' Algeria, as their repression has only fueled nationalism. The film therefore ends with the vision of Algerian crowds demanding independence ('Istiql\u00e2l') as they march through the streets of Algiers in 1960.While this is an accurate enough analysis of such a complex war (even though interestingly de Gaulle is absent from the film as it intends to show how independence was conquered, not handed from above by French authorities) it is also a metaphor, as the film works on many different levels.It is a masterpiece of editing and cinematography. The combined use of space and music is stunning: when the french paratroops take possession of the Casbah, literally filling up the frame, gaining control of the streets, rooftops, hallways, courtyards, their superbly choreographed movements are underlined by a haunting theme by Morricone & director Pontecorvo. In these sequences he rivals not only Rossellini but Eisenstein.It is also strongly influenced by the New Wave in its manner of filming faces of protagonists. Some of the most beautiful moments in the film (as the beginning in Ali's hiding hole, or the scenes before the explosions in the bars) consist of protagonists' faces, victims, perpetrators, bystanders, shot in close up, in a beautiful black and white, without comment or voice-over: their common humanity is shown as well as the determination, the inner flame of those fighting for independence.I would disagree with other reviewers saying the movie is is unbiased: the film was commissioned and encouraged by the new-born Algerian state, and Yacef Saadi, a leader in the war of independence appears in prominent role. While the violence of both sides is coolly examined, the film justifies that of the Algerians, if only by showing (in a slightly dishonest way) that it always responds to the violence of the French. This question of precedence (who started to be inhuman?), though in the end quite pointless, has long poisoned mutual understanding between French and Algerian memories of the war. Another bias, explained by the FLN financing and staging, is the almost complete absence in the film of the middle ground, those neither in the terrorist FLN or in the paratroops, desiring to live in peace. They have existed, in both sides, as the examples of writer Albert Camus and his friend Mouloud Ferraoun show. This is quite understandable as it might not fit in the epic text depicted in realistic manner by Pontecorvo. However, in the film, the Algerians that are not committed to war are shown to be gangsters and pimps: this is a minor flaw of the film and its only touch of propaganda.All that said, the film is a stunning visual, historical and ethical masterpiece. Sadly and ironically, it capture a fiery desire for liberty at the very time (1965) a military coup by Boumediene overthrew Ben Bella in Algeria, repressing liberties for the decades to come. Most of all, it is one of the most potent depictions of and reflections on violence (in the twin and extreme forms of terrorism and torture) to be seen on screen.The most powerful image of the film remains the vision of a FLN militant broken by torture and forced to confess the hiding place of his chief. His haunted look, exhausted stance, empty eyes, grotesquely dressed in a paratroops' uniform, stand as an indictment of colonialism.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 28, "votes": 35}, "heading": "Best historical film ever?", "date": "2004-12-27T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0987933"}, {"content": "This is a new print of the celebrated documentary about the 1954\u009662 Algerian war of independence.

Director Gillo Pontecorvo, who was heavily influenced by neorealist Italian director Rosselini, was also a communist activist during WWII.Despite their credentials, the film falls short of being propaganda. The Battle of Algiers is a black-and-white masterpiece, with scenes so realistic it is difficult to believe they were scripted and re-shot years after the war had ended, albeit in the same locationsPontecorvo pioneers the use of hand-held camera and other techniques to create immediacy. The score, by Ennio Morricone and Yacef, enhances the film, interweaving percussive themes with traditional Arabic melody. The cast is made up of Ali La Pointe (played by the charismatic Brahim Haggiag), an illiterate youth who becomes the revolution's posterchild, and military commander Ali Kader (Yacef). The only professional actor in the cast, Jean Martin, is Colonel Matthieu, the efficient, hardline head of the French paratroopers brought in to quell the uprising. This film will engage you, emotionally and intellectually.

I had always thought, perhaps simple-mindedly, that the movie was clearly on the side of the denizens of the Kasbah. After all, the script was inspired by the life and activities of a FLN leader who also literally acts in an important role in the movie. Seeing the movie again -- via Criterion's absurdly lavish 3-disc (!) edition -- did nothing to alter my opinion, though it DID provoke some new perspective on why the movie may SEEM even-handed.In two words? Jean Martin. He plays Colonel Mathieu, a former Resistance fighter and concentration camp veteran, now in the untenable position of winning a battle in a war doomed to failure for the French. Martin happens to be the only professional actor on the premises, and this probably explains his dangerous magnetism on screen and his ability to get us to immediately latch onto him for \"identification\". Everybody admires a good soldier, and Mathieu is exactly that. Cool, world-weary, competent, tactically brilliant, not above admiring his enemies, sophisticated. Everybody admires a good actor, also, and Martin gets all the good lines in *The Battle of Algiers*, which is really unfortunate, because we should be admiring the Algerians instead of this professional oppressor. This is the flaw in Pontecorvo's movie that, in my opinion, prevents it from being a true masterpiece. Col. Mathieu damn near unbalances the whole thing when he irrupts into the movie about a half-hour into it.The problem is that there are no equally compelling Muslim figures in the film to balance off Mathieu. Jaffar, played by the above-mentioned real-life FLN leader Saadi Yacef, is an important character to the plot yet has no interiority. The young man playing the fiery \"Ali La Pointe\" LOOKS magnificent, but the script doesn't do much for him, other than to tell him to look angry. We don't get to know the three women who tart themselves up as French sophisticates in order to sneak past the checkpoints so that they can plant bombs in civilian areas. The teenage boys who shoot the gendarmes to death are just faces in the crowd. Pontecorvo's magisterial Neo-Realism manages to be both dry and diabolically partisan: after all, a nameless mass of people avoids having character flaws, and Pontecorvo and Yacef don't want to muddy the waters with unlikeable individuals. (But perhaps we don't want that either, as the Algerians' cause is eminently just.) If you want to be politically correct, you may congratulate Pontecorvo for refusing to present the Muslims in a traditionally melodramatic way, but this approach fails the test of great drama: development of character.Having said all that, I also don't want to be misconstrued: *The Battle of Algiers* is a great and important film that is an almost mandatory viewing experience, given the shocking and scandalous similarities between what's going on in Arabia right now and the events of the Algerian uprising depicted in this film. It appears that officials at the Pentagon screened this movie for themselves a couple of years ago: one hopes that the scenes of torture in *The Battle of Algiers* didn't give them some kinky ideas for Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay, though it's rather hard to imagine what other uses they could get out of the movie (besides, of course, the obvious lesson: don't mess with the Muslims). The scenes of torture, terrorism, and the loud clamoring for freedom will alternately raise blood pressures and stoke outrage, regardless of an individual's political bias. The cinematography by Marcello Gatti is a culmination of Neo-Realist and cinema-verite techniques, and the score by Ennio Morricone is groundbreaking.Make an effort to see *The Battle of Algiers*; it will truly pay off.

I say this because of a passion for war movies.Off I went then, from website to website in search of as much information on Battle as could've been mustered. Alas, it took only the short synopsis provided by one particular website to convince me that this is something I must have. A rare type of movie, an insightful piece of film-making by one of the last passionate directors of our time and pure cinematic power are truths that best describe Battle.The movie essentially involves the struggle of the Algerian people from the early fifties thru 1962 for independence. This struggle became organised through the formation of the \"FLN\" or National Liberation Front (the abbreviation might be French). The other part of the story details the involvement of one of NLF's martyrs, Ali La Pointe, an Algerian mason hoodlum turned war hero. The situation in Algeria was tense and often horrific even after the assistance they lent the French army in WWII to drive out the Germans from France and other French territories. The Algerians were obviously hoodwinked into believing that independence lay in store for them as reward for their wartime sacrifices. They couldn't have been more wrong. The French continued with their occupation and administration of Algeria only to further alienate the Algerian people. The best jobs, homes and clubs, for instance, were for the French. In addition the Casbah, a remnant part of Turkish times, growing more populated with time and fast becoming an inner city contributed to deteriorating standards of life. Mad with disgust, the Algerian people responded through the resourcefulness and determination of Saadi Yacef, also the producer and main supporting actor of Battle, to form the NLF to recruit freedom fighters. Ali, whilst in prison for a petty crime, is taken by the NLF's struggle and after acing a test in courage and resolve put upon him by Saadi, joins the organization. Thus begins the mayhem. The NLF executing French police at random, the French responding by bombing the Casbah, the NLF using Algerian beauties to plant bombs in French public places, simply represents the first half of the film. Enter the French 10th Airborne Division under one Lt. Colonel Matthieu, paratroopers who had ousted the Germans from most of France and seen many other battles. The paratroopers carry out torture on interrogation victims, impose curfews, screen Algerian people on the streets, raid the Casbah at will and are responsible for some Algerians ending up missing. All this isn't without any humour though, as Matthieu, asked by his CO to name the operation, looks out the window through field glasses suddenly seeing an ad for champagne and deciding to name it \"Operation Champagne\". The humour is short lived though, as Mattieu takes the city by storm rooting out one terrorist after the other, whilst suffering casualties of course, until he finally nabs Saadi. This then leaves for the climax of Ali being cornered in a hideout with a few other loyalists at which point none refuse to surrender. The film then continues to depict the ongoing fight which lasts some 4-5 years before Algeria is officially declared independent in 1962.The film's contrasts between light and the dimness of the Casbah heighten the sense of dread. Scenes of rioting crowds couldn't have been more realistic bearing in mind Pontecorvo's insistence that no documentary footage was used. Explosions actually go off in public places causing what appears to be genuine mayhem. Never have I had a lesser respect for CGI animation when stark realism was the order of the day. The acts of terrorism, insurgency and counter-insurgency are so mercilessly depicted that these scenes hold relevance till today. Suffice it to say that this film is one of the most brutal tellings of the quintessential struggle of an oppressed people for liberty.Enjoy!", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "They don't make 'em like this anymore... \"Spoilers\"", "date": "2004-10-25T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0952876"}, {"content": "I am an Algerian from the capital city Algiers, I live in the USA now .Of course that movie is magnificent, the details , the unbias aganda etc. However , what I don't understand is why the American newspapers are labeling this movie and its action TERRORISM!!!I don't get it, Algerians were colonised , raped etc,,,I know you don't want to hear it but my point is that we freed our selves with guerilla and a diplomatic struggle internationally against the french who did horrible stuff.

Gillo Pontecorvo's `Algiers' shows the decade leading to that liberation in a powerful story about Muslims asserting their rights through violence, hiding, and plotting in the Kasbah, a demiworld of narrow, winding, seemingly endless alleys that are the only protection the rebels have from the eyes of the French. The re-release of the 1965 black and white film is a convincing story of a people who do not want to be occupied and will give their lives so their families can one day be free.The story centers on a couple of Muslim leaders, the charismatic Col. of the French forces, and the bombings and shootouts that at one point averaged just over 4 per day. The film's sympathy is for the Muslims, but the Colonel has moments of reflection that could be sympathetic, especially with the revelation that he was a member of the resistance in WWII and may have suffered in a concentration camp. The director shows the influence of Italian neo-realists like Roberto Rossellini (`Paisan') by shooting in documentary style on location, using non-actors (except for the Colonel), and generally avoiding an agitprop angle.But the film's sympathy in the end belongs to the occupied people. When 3 rebel women change appearance to look French, infiltrate, and plant bombs, the irony obvious to American audiences in their current struggle is a tribute to the strength of the narration and characterization and the universal dislike of occupation and subjugation.The torture of the Muslim prisoners is the most poignant relevance to the recent scandal in Iraq. The Colonel's justification for the practice to gain life-saving information is classic `ends-justify-the-means' logic still being used by great nations.

It's a vivid and very specific recreation of the insurrection against the French in Algiers in the late Fifties that shows how the French systematically eradicated that insurrection. It's also a story repeated with variations in dozens of parts of the globe now, as then. But as I'm not the first to note, it's neither a partisan tract nor a user manual. It was therefore foolish of the Pentagon to watch it recently as if tips on how to control Iraqi `resistance'/'terrorism' were to be found in it, and it has been equally foolish of the Black Panthers or other revolutionaries to watch it seeking tactical information for their struggles. Those tactics did not succeed; but neither did the effort to quell the independence movement: the French won the battle but lost the war. A process that might have proceeded peacefully in a matter of months, takes years to happen. The film documents the sad foolishness of solving conflicts with violence, the maximum loss and suffering on both sides and the protraction of the inevitable outcome.\nThe insurrection The Battle of Algiers describes was effectively quelled through the leadership of the bold, methodical French Colonel Mathieu, who as we see succeeds in eliminating the organizational structure of the resistance, `triangle' by `triangle', using torture to ferret out names and locations of the autonomous `terrorists'/'partisans,' then killing the `head' of the `worm' their structure represents so it can't `regenerate.' Once this happens, after a merciless French campaign following a general strike, the sympathizers in the majority Algerian population are totally demoralized; but two years later a vigorous national independence movement `suddenly,' `spontaneously,' springs forth, and not long afterward France has to grant Algerian independence. It's at this point, rather than at the moment of Mathieu's momentary triumph, that the film ends.\nGillo Pontecorvo undertook his masterpiece after prodding from the resistance leader, Saadi Yacef, but he made a film equally sympathetic toward and critical of both sides. We see as much of the French dissection of the situation and repression of it (by the police chief, then Colonel Mathieu) as we see of the `terrorists'/'partisans' planning and execution of their actions. We see Colonel Mathieu as an appealing macho hero with moments of noble fair play, a shades-wearing, cigarette puffing veteran who moves around with clarity, honesty, and panache; he himself has a `partisan' background. The `terrorist'/'rebel' leaders are serious, intensely committed men of various types, from the sophisticated intellectual to the young firebrand. There are no `heroes' here; or, alternately, if you like, they're all `heroes.'Mathieu appears before the press beside the captured `rebel'/'terrorist' leader - an unusual move in itself - and expresses his respect for the man's courage and conviction. The `rebel' leader in this scene is eloquent in defending `terrorist'/'rebellion' methods such as the use of baskets filled with explosives in public places. `Give us your bombs and we'll give you our baskets.' Mathieu for his part effectively explains to the journalists the necessity of torture to short circuit the `rebellion'/'terrorism'. After this explanation, the film, typically systematic at this point, begins showing a series of tortures of Algerians being carried out.\nThe first image we see in the film is the shattered face and body of the small, tortured Algerian man who's broken down and revealed where Ali `La Pointe,' the firebrand, the last remaining leader, is hiding. Then we see the `terrorist'/'terrorist' leader Ali and his closest supporters trapped like deer in their hideaway, their faces soft and beautiful. The splendid black and white photography works like William Klein's Fifties and Sixties images (he's one of the key visual commentators of that period stylistically) to powerfully capture the edgy soulfulness of the North African people and their gritty Casbah milieu. Much of the film's power comes from the way Pontecorvo was able to work, through Saadi Yacef, directly in the Casbah among the real people - as Fernando Meirelles worked in the favelas of Brazil recently with local boys to forge the astonishing City of God.The voices, which are dubbed, as was the fixed Italian filmmaking style, work somewhat less effectively because of obvious disconnects between mouth and sound at times, but the French is so analytical and the Algerians' Arabic so exotic-sounding (even to a student of Arabic) that they work, and the insistent, exciting music composed by Pontecorvo himself in collaboration with Ennio Morricone is a powerful element in the film's relentless forward movement.The fast rhythms of the editing are balanced by the stunning authenticity of the hundreds of Algerian extras who swarm across the screen: it's in the crowd scenes that The Battle of Algiers really sings. There are many superb sequences of street fighting, of people massing at checkpoints, of the French victims innocently assembled in public places; and like an exhilarating coda there is the scene of joyous victory as Algerians celebrate their independence in the last blurry moments. This is a film (again, like City of God) of almost intoxicating -- and nauseating -- violence, complexity, and fervor. Pontecorvo's accomplishment, though, is the way through showing the leaders analyzing and debating the action he freezes any impulse toward partisanship in its tracks. The evenhandedness of the coverage works a Brechtian `Alienation Effect' so you don't get caught up in rooting for one side or the other.The sequence of three pretty Algerian women carrying out an operation is a particularly memorable one -- but only one among many. First they take off their burqas and cut their hair and doll themselves up French style and then they get past the checkpoint into the French quarter to leave handbags full of explosives in a bar, a dance club, and an airport lounge. Again close-ups of faces in the bar and the jive dancers with jaunty jabbing elbows in the club show a brilliant use of image and classic editing: first the innocent, vulnerable faces, then the explosions. Here our sympathies for the French victims are fully awakened. Another sequence of Algerians removing bodies from a building has all the power and sadness of Christ's Passion.\nThere's no point where as in a conventional thriller we feel excitement and sympathy for the perpetrator, because we see the cruelty of the perpetrator and the humanity of the victim every time. The Battle of Algiers is a final triumphant use of Italian cinematic neorealismo. The killing is observed neutrally, but with sadness, as part of a stupid game caused by ignorance and played out compulsively when a political settlement would have been infinitely better - a stupid game observed with astonishing zest.\nRevived thirty-five years later in a new 35-mm. print, its grainy beauty pristinely vivid, The Battle of Algiers remains a superbly made machine that plays out the addictive game of `terrorism,' repression, torture, revolt, and full-fledged insurrection as effectively now as when it was first issued. Like any classic, it's of its time and of all time.

Refusing to surrender Ali and his men are blown to pieces when the French army dynamites the building that they are hold up in and with that Ali La Pointe's contribution to the Algerian revolt is over but not for those still fighting against the French.The movie goes into the early 1960's where the revolt got to the point where the French government, in a last and desperate effort to end the bloodshed, held an open election for Algerian independence in 1962 With the vote was 91% in favor of independence on July 5, 1962, the 132nd anniversary of the French entrance into Algeria, Algeria was proclaimed a free and independent nation and thus the bloody Algerian revolt ended. Great docudrama of one of the most defining event of the post WWII world without a single inch of actual news footage. The Algerian revolt lasted eight years and cost the French some 18,000 soldiers and 3,000 civilians The loss of life among the Algerian people was astronomical being estimated a around and even over one million dead. The Algerian revolt even spilled over into France proper itself and cost some 4,000 casualties in that country in terrorist and counter-terrorist attacks.\"The Battle of Algiers\" is one of the best historical films, even though it has no news footage in it at all, ever made and is being re-issued this year, 2004, on VHS and DVD. With what's been happening in the news it's re-release couldn't be more timely,don't miss it.

Only \"Band of Brothers,\" in my opinion and to my knowledge, is worthy of comparison. In the other direction, the formulaic leftism and phony pretensions to knowingness in Pontecorvo's \"Queimada\" result, I guess, from its subservience to the director's thoughts rather than close contact with real events.\"Algiers\" is a more complete film than \"Brothers,\" showing the battle, if not the entire war, from inception to results, from the perspectives of the all the main combatants and bystanders. This is possible because the historical conflict was more circumscribed, and, despite its documentary feel, because \"Algiers\" has more fictionalization, such as combining several real people into one character and inventing others. Nevertheless, and with the provisos that there are honest debates and I am no expert, fundamental strategy and character have not been essentially falsified.The movie opens near the end of the battle, with a chillingly unexaggerated torture of a FLN rebel by the French army, and then proceeds to the beginning. \"Algiers\" shows a city that is largely either French and bourgeois, or Moslem and proletarian. Not comfortably so. The French have a professional army, but are in a demographically precarious position. Among the Moslems, socialism and secularism are in the air a bit. Most people fear being caught on the losing side, and try to wait and see. Consequentially, small numbers can tip the balance of power. Terrorism and threat of later reprisal are used to force people off or onto the fence. The rationale for the French strategy of policing and torture is also carefully laid out.\"Algiers\" has a neither sentimentalized nor over-cynical understanding of human nature, and is very good at bringing alive the vagaries of charisma and public moods. At stake are lives, and ideology, and religion. The characters have thought hard about what is achievable, and what they are willing to sacrifice to win or survive. Appalling as are torture and random slaughter of innocents, by the end we have seen enough through the eyes of both sides to grasp how they came about.In the closing scene, the FLN's loss of the battle is juxtaposed with its later winning of the war in a way that suggests that France's loss was the logical result of France's brutality. But the intervening period is not depicted, and, to the movie's credit, causation is not clearer than in life. With hindsight, which includes the knowledge that the FLN's current extremely brutal war against an Islamist rebellion has worked, we can see that effectiveness of tactics depends on many details. Even though we know the history, the movie's tension is genuine because the outcome was not preordained.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 5}, "heading": "Politically, tactically, socially astute.
