Of course, the movie as a whole doesn't really have an arc to it and, as such, it isn't a hugely affecting experience in retrospect. However, it's incredibly engaging in the moment. It's an enjoyable time throughout, with each of its stories being of a similar quality. They're an odd mixture of societal unrest, melodramatic drama and unflinching violence, usually escalating to unpredictable extremes with blackly comic undertones. Their cinematography is fantastic, too. It's hard to separate them, in a way, but they're also decidedly distinct from one another. The overall film truly is just a compilation of them.

Rating- 7/10.No. 4 is Bombita, The Best among all six. Revolutionary. A common man's outrage against system. 9/10\"La propuesta\" is the fifth and the one with the least brutality. It depicts greed of being Rich while a Poor man lost his close one. Rating- 8/10.The last one and undoubtedly the Weakest one. \"Hasta que la muerte nos separe\" is about 'just married couple'.

The social Darwinists' argument is simple - in what can be considered as a de-facto era of capitalism, the strong should always seek to add to their power and exploit the weak.The most impressive thing about the weak is perhaps their elasticity. They don't break easily; they allow exploitation as long as they can. In other words, they remain 'civilized'. But when they chose 'act' over 'adapt', control holds no meaning.Damian Szifron said that the vertigo of losing temper is what separates civilization from barbarism. The border is a hazy one and his film, Retalos Salvajes, is about its blending. The film is an anthology, containing six stories that are united by a single theme - violence.The protagonists of the stories are what the social Darwinists would describe as the 'weaker' section. Clearly, they have been oppressed in some form of the other, but haven't reiterated, which keeps them humane. Szifron says human beings turn into animals when they explode, and the film is a depiction of the transition.The film's stories focuses on an urge which often acts as the hazy border between humans and animals - Revenge. Whether it is Gabriel Pasternak of the first story or Simon Fischer of the fourth, every protagonist is seeking revenge. Szifron has written the screenplay in a way which keeps the audience hooked to their screens. What's more impressive is, Szifron subtly highlights how each and every so-called 'animal' is perfectly human in their own rights.The film is produced by the famous Almodovar brothers. Javier Julia's cinematography is as immaculate as it could have been. Perhaps the greatest regret an audience will have after watching this film is that Szifron hasn't made another film after this.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "The fine blend of social Darwinism with edge of humanity", "date": "2020-02-14T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5482580", "sentiment score": [0.0828, 0.2115, 0.2325, 0.3439, 0.1292]}, {"content": "This movie is life in a nutshell.

It is an anthology consisting of six individual pieces themed on rage and revenge. Anthologies, in general, are helmed by two or more directors who contribute individual pieces to the final movie and by this very structure, there is a loss of congruence among the individual pieces. However, Wild Tales, is a rare exception to the aforesaid pitfall as Dami\u00e1n Szifron, who has written and directed each of the six shorts, strikes a fine balance among them and has pruned off almost all flab from the proceedings which engross the viewer in their taut storylines.\nThe movie begins with Pasternak, where a model boards an air plane and finds, through a casual conversation with another passenger, that she shares a connection with all her co-passengers in the form of her ex-boyfriend, Gabriel Pasternak. This is the shortest piece among the ensemble and precedes the title credits and packs a wicked punch in its tail that would leave a lasting impact.\nThe Rats (Spanish - Las Ratas) is set in a rainy night on deserted diner, wherein the waitress finds that the lone grumpy customer stepping in is, in fact, the loan shark who had driven her father to suicide and ruined her family. While she is inclined to insult him verbally, she finds herself caught in a bind of a fledgling moral compass, when the cook - an ex-jailbird herself - suggests mixing rat poison in his food.\nIn The Strongest (Spanish - El m\u00e1s fuerte), a suave corporate honcho is driving in his swanky premium car through a remote highway when he encounters a driver in a shabby truck who frustrates him by blocking the path with his crawling pace. He verbally abuses the truck driver and shows him the finger when he ultimately manages to overtake the truck. However, things escalate into a catastrophic case of road rage - a la Spielberg's \"Duel\", albeit in an ultra-violent version - when the honcho's swanky car has a flat tire and finds that the truck driver is the first to arrive on the scene .\nIn \"Little Bomb\" (Spanish - Bombita), a demolitions expert (Ricardo Darin - \"The Secret in their Eyes\"), trying to reach home to be in time for his daughter's birthday party, stops to buy her a cake and finds that his car was towed away despite the absence of any markings on the parking space as tow-away zone. He is driven into a righteous rage and his quest to seek justice from the corrupt system pushes him into a downward spiral resulting in him losing his money, his job and even his fragile family. His response to this unfolding turmoil transforms him into an unlikely popular hero.\nThe Deal (Spanish - \"La Propuesta\") finds a rich manipulative businessman trying to salvage a situation when he finds that his son is involved in a hit and run accident which has resulted in the death of a pregnant woman. He contacts his lawyer, a long time associate and together they cook up a plan to convince the poor gardener to become the fall guy in lieu of a suitable compensation to his family. But, when the lawyer and the investigating cop start demanding their own pound of flesh for the cover-up, the rich man finds himself in familiar territory of being a hard nosed negotiator in a high stakes game.\nThe final piece, Until death do us part (Spanish - \"Hasta que la muerte nos separe\") takes place in a boisterous wedding reception which descends into an unbridled chaotic see-saw finale when the bride, Romina (an electric Erica Rivas) discovers that the groom was sleeping with one of the guests.Seen as a whole, while Bombita and La Propuesta might seem a few shades darker in comparison to the other four stories, they stand out for their gravitas and social commentary.While at the apparent level there is no connection between the six stories, Szifron weaves them in the same thematic thread where he pushes his leads to their breaking point in a narrative that sparkles with fluency and visual flair. He also manages to transcend the vicious violence in these stories to present his views on the social decay that festers in the form of corruption, inequality and injustice that permeate Argentina at every level. Each of his stories is a resplendent exposition of Szifron's consummate skills as a writer-director, where his stories immerse the viewers in an intense roulette of role reversals, set to a lively pace, packed with oodles of wicked dark humour and horror in equal measures right till their twisted denouement.Wild Tales was a final nominee for the award for the Best Foreign Language Film at the Academy Awards where it lost to the Polish movie, Ida.

In all cases, \"wild\" is definitely the operative word of the title.In the first segment, a massive revenge is played out - one which might appeal to many of us at least in fantasy. Its conclusion is frighteningly prophetic considering a similar event that occurred after the film was made.In the second segment, a young waitress recognizes a rude customer who badly mistreated her family many years ago. She has a striking conversation with the cook who seems to have no issue about serving 'just desserts'. This conversation (which includes the speculation that prison life would be better than living a life of underpaid work) is sinister in an oddly appealing way. We might not agree with the cook at first but she sounds strangely convincing.The third sequence is the ultimate road-rage show as it pits a city boy against a country boy. This is one that goes over-the-top at times including a scene that is truly gross (don't eat while watching it). Despite the high antics, the solid directing by Damian Szifron still keeps us on edge eager to know what could possibly happen next.In segment # 4, an engineer with a willful personality is at odds with his city's procedures on towing vehicles. He is so stubborn at times, that it is challenging whether or not to side with him even if most viewers would share his anger at government bureaucracy and civil servants who are snotty. The conclusion is rather shocking in a way that leaves one smiling.The fifth segment is the only serious one of the lot. A rich family and its lawyer work to buy justice to avoid having one of its members persecuted in a crime. It's very spine-tingling with lapses of morality being the main source of the tension. The shocking conclusion leaves one wishing that this story had been extended to a full feature-length film.The sixth and final segment follows a wedding party that goes to hell in a hand-basket. While all performers in all segments are great, it is fair to say that Erica Rivas, as the unhinged bride, gives the movie's standout performance. Like the third segment, the revenge/punishment seems to exceed the original harmful deed. The conclusion might seem unbelievable but the path of reaching it is so wonderfully chaotic, it seems to have credibility after all.Szifron directed all segments with great skill. He potentially leaves viewers enjoying the revenge vicariously while maybe getting in touch with some of our own worst human instincts.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "\"Wild\" indeed.

Wild Tales is a black-comedy anthology film consisting of six distinctive stories directed by Damian Szifron with one consistent theme: revenge. In the 21st Century, most people live begrudgingly having to repress themselves, but some do explode. And this is the film about those that explode.\nThe film begins with \"Pasternak\", a shocking start to a two-hour roller coaster ride. The beautiful runway model, briskly boards a plane with the ticket fully paid by her company. She walked right into a surprising reunion. It seems that everyone on the plane knows her ex-boyfriend, Pasternak. More than 30 000 in the air, what could they do?\nThe next tale takes us deeper into the joy of vengeance. \"The Rats\" sets in a small diner on a rainy night. The waitress recognized the new customer to be the loan shark that destroyed her family. And he is now running for mayor! Back at the kitchen, she is content to just repress her anger, however, the old cook has other ideas. Why should \"bastards run the world?\"\nThe \"Road to Hell\" pushes the film to a climax. A case of road rage between the rich Audi driver and a redneck driver of a slow-moving truck. This part contains absurd violence.\n\"Bombita\" tells the demolition engineer's misfortunes that has started when his car keeps getting towed from the streets where there isn't a yellow line. His struggle to fight the corrupt towing company was fruitless. He'll have to use his own knowledge as a tool of redemption.\nHowever funny the previous tales were, no one would be laughing in the \"The Deal.\" A rich couple woke up to find their pampered son shaking from the hit-and-run in which he was the driver. They try to get the gardener to take the fall for a hefty sum. The justice isn't served in this ugly tale.\nThe last tale, \"Till Death Do Us Apart\", is absolutely brilliant finish to the film. It is startling, but also the most glorious of all. Set at a lavish wedding, the deliriously happy bride Romina, with her husband Ariel, celebrates with a hall full of family and friends. Until Romina discovered that Ariel has cheated on her - then all hell broke down.\nAny of these short tales could have been shot separately and would each be brilliant short movies.

Yet they all deal with the same thing. What would it look like if someone reached their utter breaking point, was taken over the line of what is bearable, and just... snapped.It can sound a bit over the top, and the film is labeled comedy for a reason, but at the same time director Dami\u00e1n Szifron gives it a dark undertone. Many of the stories are more than critical towards Argentinian government and public offices, and lets face it, people rarely snap in a graceful manner. Still the balance is always there. It is ugly, jarring and sometimes even a bit unpleasant, but you can always find the humour in the situation.I'd even argue that it isn't played enough for laughs. The first story, taking place on an airplane, is easily the most outlandish of the six. A truly bizarre scene that ends just about perfectly. It raises the bar quite high and none of the stories that follow can match it. To be fair, they're not even trying to, being more realistic in scope and circumstance, but it's still somewhat a shame.My second favourite is actually the second most outlandish one. A man has his car towed on the day of his daughter's birthday, and being a demolition engineer, he figures it's a high time to do something about this veritable highway robbery that masquerades as a towing office.My least favourite would probably be the last one, taking place at a wedding. It's a bit on the long side and the humour just isn't there. It has some good moments in it, but overall it left me feeling quite ambivalent.Still, none of the stories were bad by any means.

That's what came to my mind, as the six unconnected stories in this movie could just as well have been titled \"Savage Tales\". They are all positioned at some level for a savage outcome, and some of them are ironically hilarious in the execution, especially the wedding story between Romina and Ariel that closes things out.Another common element to be found in the offing is that familiar bugaboo about unintended consequences. The two tales of catastrophic road rage bear that theme out in cataclysmic fashion. The third story about the two drivers escalating into a violent confrontation ending in a fiery finale is so over the top that you wouldn't even consider the investigating sheriff's comment about a crime of passion. But it's there and lends a twisted component to the gruesome tale, one that will double you over with it's demented logic.The hit and run segment was another one of those unintended consequence stories that was visited in the end upon the hapless gardener who thought he was going to come out of it set for life. It's interesting to consider what might have happened to all the other parties involved after this story went black. All those scheming money grubbers were going to wind up with nothing in my interpretation, with their golden goose cooked. But I'm sure they would still try to squeeze Mauricio with his fat bank account. The unbridled greed in the story is enough to make you wince.And what can you say about the wedding story? The way it played out and the way it ended were so diametrically opposed to each other that you can only wind up shaking your head. But I guess that's what made it so viscerally entertaining. My summary quote is a line from the song that played out over the closing of that story, another fitting but ironic tribute to a masterful tale of love gone wrong and traveling full circle.This is the only film I've ever seen from the young Argentinian director Damian Szifron, but if his other output is even half as creative, he's got a huge future ahead.

The six combined stories that compose this amazing cinematic experience - \"Pasternak\" (Pasternak), \"The Rats\" (Las Ratas), \"The Strongest\" (El m\u00e1s Fuerte), \"Little Bomb\" (Bombita), \"The Proposal\" (La Propuesta) and \"Till Death Do Us Apart\" (Hasta que la Muerte nos separe) - , bring to life our deepest desires and craziest reactions when faced with typical everyday life situations. It also makes us wonder how the little acts and decisions can easily make things fall apart in a matter of seconds. Although all the short stories were written by the same person (Dami\u00e1n Szifron), they were directed and produced by different people, which gives this movie a particularity not commonly found in the movie industry. In my opinion, the greatest thing about this movie is that is a roller coaster of emotions. We are invited to immerse the stories and to live together with the characters what they are experiencing. And although, the stories have different themes - drama, comedy, etc. - the one thing that connect all of them, without exception, is the vendetta. The next parts may contain spoilers, so read it with care. The revenge is shown to us in many different ways. We see it as in an old and maturated remorse and hate towards others (as it is displayed in the Pasternak's story) and we can also find some of it in The Rats, but the feeling of punishing the man that was responsible for the protagonist death didn't come from the girl, but for her coworker in the restaurant.On the other stories (The Strongest, Little Bomb and Till Death Do Us Apart), we see it as a mad driven feeling, but the difference is that something happened at that moment. Is a fresh action that triggered that feeling. Actually, even in the 5th story, The Proposal we can see it in the last, very last scene. The soundtrack is also incredible and it is in the hands of Gustavo Santaolalla, an Argentinian producer, and songwriter. His work can also be seen in other pre-staged movies (\"Babel\", \"Into The Wild\", \"The Brokeback Mountain\", \"The Motorcycle Diaries\") and also in the worldwide famous video game, \"The Last of Us\". To wrap it up, it's a full movie: you will cry from laughing, you will cry from sadness, you will feel shocked and also a little embarrassed. It's a movie that you can see with a relative, friends, boyfriend, girlfriend, etc. I just don't think it is well suited for children (since it can be a little violent and also have some sexual scenes).", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Revenge and comedy rule this movie.", "date": "2017-11-06T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3851446", "sentiment score": [0.0028, 0.0062, 0.02, 0.2666, 0.7043]}, {"content": "I found this movie coincidentally. 6 stories, one by one, I see humour that doesn't make me laugh, but merely put me in situation of how the jokes are happening for real.

A follow-up tale in which a waitress cannot decide whether to poison a gangster's food is equally intense and a third sequence with two deserted highway drivers has the biggest laughs.

The fifth sequence involving a covered-up hit-and-run is the weakest, lacking the comedic air of the earlier segments, and while comedy comes back in full force for the sixth tale of a wedding gone awry, the chapter is a little on the long side.

The death of a pregnant woman and her unborn baby by hit-and-run, a child being poisoned, terrorist acts such as a bomb exploding at downtown or an airplane being hijacked with the intent of crashing it; those are horrible tragedies we have no reason to laugh about in real life. Szifr\u00f3n confessed on an interview his plan was to write possible thrillers and dramas, and ended compiling the 6 wildest scripts for this anthology movie. And the subject of these 6 stories is indeed dramatic and spine-chilling. But...The way Argentinians are, with very witty remarks, proud, acid and not afraid of blurting out curses, the outlandish way how the main characters react on being wronged, and yet surrounding characters still find it humorous (\"Bombita\" is cheered on by the average population) or find a way to vent out the pressure of these dark events (\"soooo, commissioner: would you state this was a crime of passion?\"); THAT's the reason why this is a black comedy. Every line is funny and down-to-earth: believe it or not Argentinians are just like this, especially the father at \"The Deal\". There's a contrast between the horrifying rage expressed physically and the verbal language dismissing the horror of hatred. Yet the terrible consequences are there, inescapable, tearing everyone's life apart.Putting \"Pasternak\" and \"Till Death Do Us Part\" as opening and closing segments set the comedic tone: they're so bizarre that they can, in the proverbial saying, actually \"get away with murder\". Sbaraglia, Dar\u00edn and Mart\u00ednez are well cast in the more dramatic parts, they have great acting weight and are very known in their country and abroad.

The beast can be unchained by nothing more complicated than being cut off by a driver who doesn't signal or finding that our car has been impounded for an unwitting parking infraction. In the first and shortest episode, what appears to be an absurd series of coincidences linking all the passengers on a plane turns out to have a logical and sinister rationale. The ending explains why in the opening scene the woman checking in at the airport is told that she will not earn frequent flyer points for her trip! And the final, longest episode hilariously tracks the chaotic degeneration of a stereotypical Jewish wedding party, initiated by the bride's discovery that the groom has been cheating on her with one of the guests.

Dark and bloody, but I found this tale the least satisfying - however there was an interesting message to ponder in the ending.3) Road tale: Very violent, and a little ironic.

Or perhaps there's also a touch of Kafka to some of this - people who are put into completely insane situations that start from something typical (a guy who flips off or a guy getting flipped off while driving, or a guy getting his car towed), or not so much (a groom's infidelity discovered by the bride right in the middle of the wedding reception, or a negotiation by rich men over how to save a kid from going to jail for running someone over).In either case, there's a totally bizarre streak that is aimed largely at people who are pretty well off, and the violent, rather macabre circumstances that occur to them. There's no connecting characters from one short to the next, unlike some anthology films out there, but it's certainly a film that connects the threads together like a book of short stories does. It's almost the kind of film I don't want to tell you too much about before you see it; I knew relatively little except that it had been up for the Golden Palm and an Oscar a year or so ago, and that it was produced by Pedro Almodovar (and for the latter, he rarely produces outside of his own work, so it must mean something major).I can tell you that all but one of the shorts is astonishingly good (\"The Deal\" is the one that is just alright, though it still is well directed and acted, with an interesting conclusion, just not the strongest narrative thrust - the one short that might've worked better as a scene in another, full feature film). If there's another connecting thread it's that the stories feature escalation of some kind from one small thing into something that mushrooms. This is highlighted most by a scene involving two motorists, which makes, for lack of a better comparison, Duel look like kids playing with toys as far as brutal mania goes.It's not like things go crazy right off; the shell of civilization and often having to be proper in a setting is highlighted, like at a DMV or at a wedding or on an airplane or even as simple as serving someone in a small town diner. Some of the characterizations are certainly nuts for some of the people, but that's part of the fun for me. Seeing the screws turned by the filmmaker, Dami\u00e1n Szifr\u00f3n, is a real joy and there's a sense of inspiration from one episode to the next - how will can things really get? A lot of this is genuinely unexpected, and it's more-so based on behavior (again, a good number of the characters here are well-dressed, upper-middle class, again the sort of figures Bunuel went after from time to time, though minus the religious side of things).But more than anything it's about something which is ripe for the darkest comedy (though an undercurrent of severity runs in it) and it also comes down to revenge, which is usually enough incentive to find humor in the greatest of human disasters (especially, most so, when they go kind of really wrong). While you can read a lot into the satire of it all, that this figure or that or this institution does this or this other one is broken (marriage, the legal system, the bureaucracy, simply flipping someone off), it's almost best to look at this as a guy who is at a party and holding your undivided attention with a story that sounds too good to be true, but it is not, and then five times more.

A young waitress in a restaurant discovers she is serving a man who, many years earlier, was the reason for her father to die and is an otherwise vile human being running for a political position. A demolitions professional finds himself besieged by the frustrations of a car towing company and the corrupt city that is mostly after the towing and parking ticket fees. And the grand finale is a wedding where past secrets make their way out into the open. There are a couple of good laughs throughout but it's mostly a dish best served cold.

It is an outrageous collection of shorts set in Szifron's homeland\u2014a sextet of improbable shaggy-dog stories, insane urban legends and entertainingly twisted cautionary yarns of the sort that people dispense during a night of heavy drinking, tied together by violent themes. Through six short parables, every facet of violence gets held up to the camera: its capacity for destruction, for vengeance, for justice, for renewal - in its most cathartic but glorious form.The film opens with one of the most daring \"eff-you's\" in years involving a group of plane passengers who make a terrible, terrible discovery after take-off. From there follows five more stories: a young waitress struggles to decide whether or not to put rat poison in the food of a loan shark who ruined her family's life; two motorists - a self-centered yuppie and a fed-up average - see how far road rage can push them in a game of deadly one-oneupmanship; a demolitions expert becomes a folk hero after fighting back against a corrupt transportation department; a rich father gets in over his head after he tries to bribe his grounds-keeper to take the blame for his drunk son's fatal hit-and-run accident; a wedding goes off the rails as a newlywed bride systematically humiliates and emotionally annihilates her groom after discovering that he cheated on her with a comely brunette and then invited her to the wedding reception - each story ups the ante in terms of rage.Szifron never attempts a grand statement about the nature of violence. He just lets each situation take itself to its logical, exaggerated conclusion. But something else lingers underneath all of this damn-near macabre madness. Most of the stories include a tug-of-war between social castes, with the upper and working classes duking it out over who can do the most dirt. But every time, the grim veneer of gallows humor shimmers through. While the stories themselves are about the joys of losing control, their creator knows exactly what can be achieved with crafty pacing, masterly editing and a precisely controlled balance between the matter-of-fact and the shamelessly hysterical. This is a master craftsman presenting a confident vision of revenge and primal anger that ranges from playful to disturbing. Szifron has a devilish good time crafting the shorts and exhibits a sophisticated eye, and a flair for creating morally ambiguous characters you don't know whether to root for. But that's Wild Tales for you - a wondrous, whacked-out look at volatile human beings doing what they think is right, when wronged.Wild Tales is a splendidly anarchic portrait of a world on the verge of a nervous breakdown - as sharp as a corkscrew and every bit as twisted.

They're staples of cinema, from Once Upon a Time in the West, Oldboy through to what Dami\u00e1n Szifr\u00f3n's multiple story filled saga Wild Tales could compare itself to most, Falling Down.In Joel Schumacher's well liked and remembered Michael Douglas starrer from 1993 where Douglas's William Foster had finally had enough and took his anger out on a city (and its poor fast food workers) audiences got to live viscerally through scenarios that our wildest imaginations have perhaps at times wandered off to and it's in this unlikely yet somehow relatable subconscious that Szifron makes Wild Tales work as some form of distant cousin to Schumacher's anti-establishment flick.Backed by famed director Pedro Almodovar, Szifron's Argentinian film (which was nominated for Best Foreign Film at last year's Academy Awards) is a well shot and highly dark collection of stories that all in some way, shape or form centre around revenge.As with all such films that feature a mishmash of stories, Szifron finds himself succeeding at some (a highway set piece and a hit and run cover up are highlights) whilst other scenarios like a diner scene or the films wedding finale feel a tad underwhelming but Wild Tales constantly engages the audience with its for lack of better word \"wild\" tone and lack of political correctness that would not be found in a Hollywood production of a similar ilk.Blood is spilled, explosions are ignited and rat poison is used in but a few of Wild Tales scenes and the film has an air of unpredictability about it that will often have you on tenterhooks even if the film could've lost 15 \u2013 20 minutes in the editing suite thanks to a few segments that seem a little flabby around the edges, with drawn out situations and scenes, but there's little doubting the originality of much of what Wild Tales brings to the table.For fans of dark comedy not unlike early Coen Brother films or even a Tarantino creation, Wild Tales could just well become a new favourite and while some segments fall a little flat, Wild Tales is certainly one heck of a ride and the perfect antidote for those seeking a break from the usual Hollywood fair.3 \u00bd angry chefs out of 5", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "A truly \"wild\" experience", "date": "2016-01-28T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3404633", "sentiment score": [0.0176, 0.0912, 0.3125, 0.4816, 0.0971]}, {"content": "The 6 stories are very good and the direction and acting was mind- blowing.

This one reminded me of \"Amores Perros,\" with the welcome difference that the episodes--all exploring the theme of vengeance and retribution--get better as they go along.The first is like an old Rod Serling Twilight Zoner, assuming CBS standards and practices had been a lot looser back in the day.

A young, rich man sits sobbing and drunk at the foot of his parent's bed. And a wedding starts to unravel.These are the 6 stories of Wild Tales. Innocuous at their outset, yet linked by the same cathartic spiral into madness. An exploration of 'the pleasure of losing control'; that is, the very human and fundamental passions that bubble beneath the reserved exteriors of the modern man and woman, here bursting forth in gleefully mean- spirited, exquisite release.\u200bThis marks my first foray into Argentinian cinema, and I am simply overwhelmed by how much I enjoyed this film. Each twist, turn, and act of beautiful passionate savagery was simply a pleasure to watch. This was only further enhanced by some truly wonderful cinematography and solid performances form the cast. The wit is sharp, the characters endearing in their madness, and the satire biting.For me though, the truest success of this film lies in that core sense of humanity. There is something so inherently sympathetic about each of these stories that one can't help but be drawn into the spiralling madness. The savagery that pervades the film lies not only in wrath and anger, but also love and passion, self- destruction, family and selfishness. \u200b And of all the stories, the one I think that best encompasses this is 'Until Death Do Us Part': The Wedding that implodes upon itself. Somehow this tale manages to strike a thousand emotional notes and yet still be cohesive, compelling and tonally jarring in the most exquisitely deliberate way. On the day of their wedding a wife discovers her husband has cheated on her with one of the guests. What follows is an emotional carousel as the couple punish each other, themselves and their families; exploring the reaches of violence and lust and giddy seething fury. Yet somehow when the dust has settled, the fury exhausted and the wounds bandaged, this broken couple stand in the wreckage of their lives and find their love again as they throw themselves into an act of lustful, vulgar defiance to the world.The catharsis of these taut, charged moments resonate through the whole movie and culminate in an experience truly unique in it's delight for the inherent violence of life and man himself.

First follows a group of people on a plane who discover that they all have a common acquaintance. Second follows a waitress who recognises her client and the tragedy he caused in her life. Third concerns two drivers whose argument ends with tragic consequences. Fourth follows a demolition expert whose life is destroyed by a car towing incident. Fifth is about a wealthy family whose son has an overnight hit-n- run accident, and the sixth is centred around a wedding party in which the bride just finds out about her husband's infidelity.Written & directed by Dami\u00e1n Szifron, all the six stories within Wild Tales are connected by a common theme of violence & vengeance but the morbid wit of it makes sure that it never becomes too serious. All the tales are captivating & strong enough to stand on its own, all the characters are brilliantly penned down plus the actors do a terrific job in bringing them to life, Szifron's screenplay is as impressive as his quality direction, and each tale packs in highly believable scenarios, thus making it more effective. For me, every subsequent short was better than the one preceding it and the film as a whole never for once feels dull.The technical aspects make sure that all the stories exhibit the same feel & texture in order to maintain a consistent tone throughout its runtime. Cinematography binds it all the stories together with nearly similar camera-work & colour composition in all six stories, and all sets are brightly light. Its 122 minutes of runtime is steadily paced and every segment is tightly wrapped. A dark, sinister ambiance encapsulates the whole film at all times and the tense vibe is effectively sustained. Music plays a vital role in balancing the whole act and Gustavo Santaolalla's exquisite score does exactly that, in addition to some cool selection of songs.Coming to the performances, every cast member does a fantastic job in their given roles & the sum of the parts is always greater than any individual contribution. The leading actors in each segment carry that story amazingly well and even the ones chipping in with supporting work are no slouch. The acting ranges from thoroughly restrained to totally maniacal but all of their inputs are in tune with the narrative these characters are confined to. Ricardo Dar\u00edn is one of the best highlights but the film saves its best for the last, where the duo playing a newly wed couple take the stage in a calm, fashioned manner but turn absolutely deranged to finish the film on a memorable high.On an overall scale, Wild Tales is a pleasant surprise for I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it turned out to be. It's a wild, crazy & demented experience that delivers the thrills in the most unexpected ways and is finely balanced & accomplished in both storytelling as well as technical aspects.

This is the pent up hatred that never takes form, until it does all at once. The other is a dormant hatred that pops up from being dormant and has no place in the current world but nevertheless you are tempted to act upon it. Revenge sometimes takes forms where you want to do something slightly worse than what the other person did to you, but this sometimes creates a cycle of violence. Small things piling may escalate situations in a non-linear manner. And people who have little to lose will be seeking retribution in the flashiest of fashions, and perhaps without any real intent to harm someone but merely wish to express a manifestation of their emotions. Another is about misdirection, refusing to accept the societal consequences of an action and instead seeking to transform them into an economic ones. It is the choosing of who incurs the damage vengeance and the rewiring of justice. Finally the tit for tat story, where there is the concept of getting even for being wronged which if properly executed, will balance any initial asymmetries.

This omnibus Spanish feature, sharply written and directed by Damian Szifron, offers a series of very dark, very disturbing and sometimes very humorous vignettes, all centered on chance (and not so chance) encounters that go awry in unexpected and often tragic ways. The movie makes it clear that, while you may think you have control over your life, in the grand scheme of things, you're really just a pawn subject to the whims of other individuals, a soulless bureaucracy or, most chillingly, a cruel and mocking Fate. However, in two of the cases, the participants do manage to wrest control back from the outside forces and determine the course of their lives - to some extent, at least.As is often the case with these kinds of morality tales, most of the scenarios rely heavily on situational irony to get their points across. I won't detail the various stories (you really need to experience them for yourself), but I will note that the first one, involving an airliner, comes uncomfortably close to an actual event that occurred after the movie was released. Segments one and three contain the most visceral impact, while others cut deeper psychologically. Even the tones vary from one storyline to another. For instance, the final story, about a wedding that turns into a surrealistic nightmare, is shot through with pitch-dark humor. Replete with sharp performances from a talented cast, the movie touches on such universal human themes as revenge, road rage, class privilege, all tied to the sense of powerlessness one feels when confronted with forces bigger than oneself. In its own subtle, quiet way, the movie has a remarkable ability to keep the audience on the edge of its seat, filled with a kind of gnawing dread as we await the catastrophe we sense is just over the horizon. As with all the best horror tales, Szifron understands that the anticipation is often more terrifying than the actual event when it finally arrives.

It did not win, but the very fact that it made it to the prestigious Final Five ensured broader success and world-wide distribution. Some may say that the film was conceived with an eye to the Oscars and festivals circuit, written in a manner that takes much from Almodovar, adds a touch of Tarantino and includes just the needed elements of local color and the gallery of fine actors to allow it to win almost all possible awards in Argentina. Almodovar actually co-produced the film, and his influence is hard to contest (I do not know how much he was involved in the making though). Yet, the wild tales brought to screen by director Dami\u00e1n Szifr\u00f3n in this film have a quality of their own, a specific grin superposed upon the human approach and the social engagement that characterizes the best South-American films, whatever genre they belong to.'Wild Tales' is a collection of stories, and if I need to define what is common among them is the fact that in all of them more or less ordinary people face day-to-day challenges that they are unable to deal with and as a result they turn into escalating spirals of conflict and violence, all managed with a good dose of black humor. The script and the director are merciless with their heroes and the stories do not end until the characters are brought to or beyond the verge of insanity. For none of them (those who survive) life will not be at the end the same as at the beginning. As viewers we can easily identify with the driver harassed by a hooligan with a truck on a deserted road, with the engineer who is late at his daughter's birthday because of an unjust parking ticket, or with the bride who discovers at the wedding party that her fresh husband not only cheated on her, but also invited 'that woman' at the wedding. We can understand why they go crazy and why they end by doing the most unreasonable acts. Most important at all ,we can laugh about these.The humor, the empathetic view and the social touch are the arguments that make out of the Argentinian director's collection of stories much more that a pastiche of Almodovar's movies. Acting is very good and each one of the characters adds its own piece to a puzzle of contemporary Argentina, a country that I know too little about.

The film is advertised as wildly funny, and perhaps if we all view human foibles and anger management crises as food for laughter then the term comedy is appropriate.

The fact that the stories are only connected by their theme would normally have annoyed me, but the stories are extremely good. After each story the viewer is not only enthralled by the climax, but is eager in anticipation for the next one. You find yourself asking how can the next one possibly top the previous, but it always does. The stories get longer and more detailed as they go along, which allows the viewer to get much more involved with much increased character development coming in the later ones. The first story starts in an airport and a seemingly normal day. We see some people going about a normal trip through an airport. It is only once they on the plane and two passengers begin a pleasant conversation that the passengers realize that the plane they are on is anything, but a routine flight.The second story takes place in a normal cheap looking restaurant. A terrible man from one of the waitress's past, walk in and sits down to eat. The waitress struggles with what do to, while the much older cook has some pretty clear ideas. The first two stories are very short, so there is not a lot more I can say about them without giving the whole thing away though. They don't need to be longer though because they are very poignant and really interesting. The first one is the absolute perfect way to set up for the rest of the film. I didn't care, as much for the second one though, it was definitely my least favorite of the six.I'm going to sound a little uncreative here, but the best way to describe the third tale is wild. It starts off with a man driving down a road, when he encounters something everyone encounters pretty much everyday: a driver in front of him or her who is driving slower. After much effort the man eventually gets around him and leaves him with a nasty insult (something probably everyone has done at some point). The story really makes you questions the parting insult, because we all do it with the rational of \"oh it doesn't matter because I'll never see him again.\" In this story though the driver does see the man again, and it turns out he took the insult pretty hard. The two men essentially lose their minds as the return blow after blow to each other each one so much worse then the one before. This story was so enthralling for me because it starts off with such a normal situation and escalates out of control so quickly.The fourth story was my favorite one in the whole film. It starts with a man, who is clearly having a bad day already, when his car gets wrongfully towed while he is picking up the cake for his son's birthday. He has to go pick it up and ends up missing the whole party. Our man, Simon, is very against society as a whole and demands retribution for his ordeal. Unfortunately he doesn't receive that at all. The towing company refuses to repay him, which leads to an anger filled tirade at the Argentinian equivalent of the DMV (basically what everyone wants to do, but doesn't actually do it). The tirade ends up getting put on the news and his wife decides to leave him because of it and his job fires him. A little while later while trying to start a new life for himself his car is wrongfully towed again. Simon decides its time to do something about it. All I will say is that his previous job was as a demolition expert. This story is just plain cool, you root for Simon the whole time, and probably wish you had the courage to yell and throw trashcans at the DMV.The fifth story begins with a news report saying that there had been a hit and run of a pregnant woman. We shortly find out it was a drunken teenager, from an extremely wealthy family. The parents have no idea what to do, until the father decides that he can pay the gardener to tell the police it was he driving. It leads to a whole lot of issues. This story is a lot darker than the others, and you don't really care for any of the character, but it is still very entertaining.The final story is the longest one and definitely the most messed up. We see a very happy wedding going on. The bride and groom are happy, but then the bride notices something weird, her husband is talking to a really attractive guest. Through a little investigating she realizes that her new husband had cheated on her. She absolutely loses her mind. The rest of the story is just nonstop craziness, but you can't look away because it is so good.These stories are so good and so original. I truly have never anything like any of them. The stories do flow pretty well together because of their common themes. Even if you don't watch all the stories, if you completely miss out you will regret it.9/10", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Six really great short films packaged together with the common theme of revenge!", "date": "2015-07-15T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3277607", "sentiment score": [0.0012, 0.0065, 0.0667, 0.7912, 0.1345]}, {"content": "The movie consists of six different pieces, each with its own strong and unique story. One common thing in all the stories is that they'll blow your mind away. I really like how the script of each story plays on the flow and duration as to avoid the viewer's anticipation rate ruining the build-up. The first story is quite quick though it builds up slowly and then rapidly escalated into suspense. The second and third stories followed almost the same formula although the duration gets longer each time the movie changes its story. But the last three stories are made to use more duration and are more intricate than the earlier ones. Yet they still possess the same unpredictability level, which is very nice. The story gets predictable only at the very last moment, and even that kind of predictability can only be seen by experienced movie goers. And yet the movie closes itself with a totally different ending for its last story.

It's often funny, sometimes shocking, and the quality of the work overall is exceptional.It looks great and sounds great, and is one of the more entertaining films that I've seen in a while. The acting is strong top to bottom, and no one segment pulls the rest of it down. They are all good, but personally I think the middle segments(\"road rage\" and \"botched wedding\") are the best. \"Dynamite Joe\" probably the weakest, and that is primarily due to it's unrealistic climax.There's some spectacular moments of cinematography and music. Definitely reminiscent of films like \"Babel\", but the subject/themes are based more upon black-comedy-bad-fortune type scenario's.

This reminded me of that Italian movie,HUMAN CAPITOL, also about a 2nd degree vehicular manslaughter hit-and-run case. I like the way Almodovar places a 'throw-away' episode first( only about 6-8 minutes long?),which shows a woman passenger about to embark on a routine flight(south America?)from Spain(Barcelona?),& soon engages in conversation w/ the other passengers, only to find out that they are all talking about a loser they once encountered,Gabriel Pasternak,who, shockingly is actually on board as well!The estranged male stewardess locks himself in the cockpit(overpowers the crew?) & proceeds to 'throw away' the entire 150 passengers on board,as the plane falls to its doom in a Argentinian suburb(?).THe episode closes w/ the shocking sight of a plane crashing into a elderly couple's backyard swimming pool,& then the film credits begin,WILD TALES...( this short episode recaps,or should I say prophesizes the later horrible GermanWings flight 9525, where Pasternak is replaced by the real life co-pilot,Andre Lubitz who threw away 150 passengers by flying plane into side of a mountain.

However, in the US it really wasn't available in most cities until well after the awards were given. This is actually not unusual for this category of films, as often they initially have a limited release in California (thus making it eligible for the Oscar) and then are later released in the rest of the country. Fortunately for me (or perhaps not), I happened to be in Philadelphia for its recent release. After having seen the film, I had a hard time believing it would be nominated for anything--let alone an Oscar.The film begins with a scene that is terrifyingly similar to the recent tragic deliberate crash of a Malaysian Airlines plane. In this film, a disgruntled man arranges for all his enemies to receive free tickets for a dream vacations or a variety of other ruses. The people eventually realize they've been duped--but only after the plane is aloft. Then, it crashes into the ground--presumably killing everyone. This is how this Argentine comedy begins. I did hear a few nervous laughs throughout the theater--though even without the recent real air disaster, I don't understand how anyone could think this was funny.What follows are five more tales which all have the common theme of revenge. A few of them work (particularly the final segment--which is very funny) but many of them just seem very disturbing and gross. The audience is treated to seeing two characters vomit on camera as well as one defecating on camera....with a close up shot of the man's anus so you could see it was real! Additionally, several of the stories just seemed ugly, disturbing and, in a couple cases, would seem to endorse violence as a means to dealing with your problems. Considering it's supposed to be a comedy, I was just left shocked and horrified. And, perhaps, that is the intention of \"Wild Tales\". It IS shocking and presents as comedy things which aren't in the least funny or entertaining.While I thoroughly hated much of the film and worry that it might seem to excuse evil behaviors, I cannot completely condemn the movie for several reasons. Segment two and six were quite good and seemed far less nihilistic. Also, while I didn't like the tone of the other stories and found them disturbing, the production was extremely well crafted. The acting, direction and cinematography were as good as anything you'd see anywhere.

Each one of them puts forth wild yet realistic situations. The first short story is the shortest of them and is shown pre-credits.Its story of a psych who is not even seen on the screen who makes revenge plan which ends on a bang giving us an overly wild ending. The second film slightly more dark and longer, will make you think before deciding what is right and what is wrong. Third one even longer, is my favorite alongside the fourth. Its violent and brutally hilarious with explosive ending(literally). The fourth one sheds light on realistic situation of a common man troubled by the abusive government system. Another explosion in the climax(again literally)! The fifth slightly less on humor quotient but portrays the human characteristic of greed perfectly. Its darker and has a shocking finale! Th last one, longest and wildest of them all will take you to one of the craziest weddings you have ever seen. Beneath its madness it subtly touches upon the issues of trust and betrayals in human relations.Besides the common notion of revenge and letting oneself lose control in rage, all these tales also focus on how tiniest of our actions can lead to monstrous consequences. The comedy is satirical and dark still its outright hilarious in many scenes. There are many actors (each story has different cast), can't highlight anyone as most of them have done a good job. Director Damian Szifron executes all the ridiculous madness and explosive twists with sheer brilliance leaving dazed at the end of each story.

The wildest part of the whole thing is that anything and everything portrayed on the screen could actually happen. In fact, some of it did. The film's opening scenes depict a scenario that is uncomfortably similar to an infamous real-life tragedy that took place in early 2015. \"Too soon,\" is the phrase I heard one woman whisper to her companion after the movie's opening sequence.

She chooses the bridal dance as the time to tell her new husband what she has learned. Without spilling the specifics, I can say that all this leads to a dramatic rooftop scene, tension and tempers rising to a fever pitch, blood on the bride's dress, paramedics treating multiple people with a variety of conditions and a cutting-the-cake scene that you won't soon forget. Suffice it to say that producers Pedro and Agust\u00edn Almod\u00f3var and writer/director Dami\u00e1n Szifron saved the wildest (and possibly the best) wild tale for last. In \"Wild Tales\", you get a series of revenge fantasies that may make you feel guilty for allowing them to entertain you. But it will probably be a pleasurable guilt. It's the kind of movie that makes you think, \"I can't believe they did that,\" immediately followed by, \"I wonder if I would do that.\" Even with real-world events tinging the first story with an unintended pathos, this film gives us six tales that represent the best in dark comedy. The situations showcased are generally relatable and seem uncomfortably possible. The many movies I've seen over the years have left me with just about every conceivable emotion upon leaving the theater, but this is the first one that left me feeling\u0085 naughty. For lack of a better word, I felt naughty for secretly rooting for people doing bad things in this movie \u2013 and for enjoying the outcome of each story as much as I did.

However, it's the thrilling stories throughout this film that will leave you breathless at every second, because it's just so unpredictable and so tense every step of the way.Firstly, an overview of the film as a whole. The fantastic directing by Dami\u00e1n Szifr\u00f3n is one of the most impressive parts of the whole saga, and it really shows off on screen, and adds a whole lot more to the excitement of the stories, whilst the stunning writing in every separate story transforms this into an unbelievably thrilling playbook that bucks the trend of so many anthologies that create a disjointed story that can be boring to watch, there are swift transitions throughout here, and every single story is always just as exciting and unpredictable as the last.So, now let's go in order of the six stories, starting with the very short, but what I think is the best, opening aeroplane tale. This is very understated and, despite its short duration, has an ingeniously gradual build up, followed by a shocking revelation and then a hilarious punchline, by far the most exhilarating part of the film.However, the second tale, set in a roadside diner, is not far off that. Here, we really see the plain horrors of people driven by revenge, and it's definitely one of the most emotional stories of the film, but it utilises its small cast and eerie setting to great effect to create something completely unpredictable and engrossing.The third tale, a road battle that is often almost identical to Stephen Spielberg's Duel, is definitely the most violent part of the film, as well as the scariest by far, because it's just got a terrifying sense of isolation and helplessness, as well as a horrifying villain, but also a protagonist who you're never quite on side with, making the tension and violence a bit more hilarious than just petrifying.That's followed by what is the longest section of the film, simply about a man who has had enough with everyone treating him like some sort of a criminal. Although this isn't the most exhilarating tale, it's the easiest to relate to, and brings across the element of stress in its main character in brilliantly clear form.The penultimate tale, although I thought it was the weakest, was still intriguing. It details the events about the lengths people will go to to protect those closest to them and then further their own agenda, and whilst the punchline was ultimately a little predictable, it was still a horrifying account of the selfishness of many people.The final tale, about a wedding gone wrong, was the greatest emotional roller-coaster of the film.

Here is a movie that explores confusion, revenge, cheating, road rage, and a few other dark situations in the modern world, in a place that we call civilized.The film is composed of various stories, all dealing in one way or another with getting even. We know we are in for a special treat when the passengers of the plane realize they're all in for the ride of a lifetime, as they discover the common link that brings them together for this special flight.First, we encounter a waitress that is given the opportunity to avenge the sad events in her family. However, things don't always work out as one expects, and there's a little thing called conscience that keeps interfering with carrying out what could be the perfect crime. Yet when we think things can't be properly solved, a \"fairy godmother\" intervenes.In the second story, a man finds himself the victim of his own short temper, but we realize that his last actions are the result of probably years of bureaucratic abuse. He has complied before, but the events in one day are just too much to take, or maybe it would have been a matter of taking a deep breath and thinking it through. Unfortunately, he chooses to act, and things get more and more complicated. Once again, in a clever twist, one can say that our hero gets what he wants.We have one of the most hilarious depictions of road rage on the screen. As an upper middle class man confronts one \"deliverance\" type, and he discovers what hell on wheels really means. Abuse after abuse is portrayed on the screen, and each of the parties tries to outsmart the others, only to have the most ironic twist at the end. Prepare to laugh.We get to see the most fantastic wedding since \"The Wedding Banquet\", but the Ang Lee film was a masterwork of comic timing. This one is funny but it's because of the tragedy that forms the basis of the events. We just can't believe what we're seeing, as the battle of the sexes heats up and the twists keep coming. In the end, we wonder if it any of it was truly necessary.\"Tales\" is a masterwork, with the presentation of the various situations, the humor in the lines, the way it was photographed and edited. Much praise is giving to particular topics. Why not explore the extremes we go to when anger becomes madness, and we forgot that we are civilized creatures, yet capable of the most animalistic actions we can imagine.

One is a woman who once broke up with him and the other, a classical music critic who savaged Pasternak's early work. A passenger sitting in front of them turns around, saying, \"Pasternak?\" She was his elementary school teacher, and says he certainly had problems. After a few more people who've wronged poor Pasternak pipe up, the music critic stands and asks, \"Is there anybody on this plane who does not know Pasternak? And who paid for their own ticket?\" There is not. I leave the rest to your imagination. And his.

To say Wild Tales is a wild ride would be quite an understatement. There are six short stories blended together, and while you may not recognize the theme immediately, it doesn't take long before rage and retribution jump to the forefront in these seemingly typical slices of everyday life.The best short stories make a quick grab for attention, and manage to convey character and setting from the beginning. The writing is crucial and can easily collapse in the hands of a less-proficient short story writer. But when it works, it's fascinating to watch, and Mr. Szifron has a real talent for making us laugh in the midst of truly awful situations.Not to give away any details, but the six stories involve: a remarkable \"coincidence\" on a flight, an unwelcome customer at a local diner, a close-quarters brawl at a bridge, the frustration of dealing with \"the system\", misguided parental instincts in protecting their kid, and the most wheels-off wedding reception ever filmed.If you are ever searching for an example of a dark comedy, this one will provide clarity.

Then the second story is \"The Rats\", confined in a small restaurant near the highway with minimal characters (two customers, one waitress and a cook) to play out a morally righteous murder starts with expired rat poisons to the appalling backstabbing, Rita Cortese as the experienced cook, is fearlessly ruthless to eradicate any excrescence of the society within her limited power, plainly because there is no other efficacious way to deter the evil ones ascending in the societal hierarchy. This time revenge is all for a good cause. Next chapter is called \"The Strongest\", a road rage clash between the posh car driver Diego (Sbaraglia) and a churlish imbecile Mario (Donado), one might recall Steven Spielberg's DUEL (1971, 7/10), but here there is no ominous car-chasing, due to a flat tyre, Diego has to pay for his stupidity to offend a low-class boor, and is driven by revenge when he has the chance to flee the scene, it is so naturalistic that the intention of killing has been induced even viewers in some level subconsciously concur with Diego's motivation, but the payoff is both ludicrous and horrendous, so revenge can be a crime of passion. The fourth one \"Little Bomb\" stars Ricardo Darin as a demolition expert, whose automobile has been towed by DMV when he is buying a birthday cake for his daughter, the next day he tries to reason with the clerks when he is coerced to pay the fine, but loses his temper and attack the partition with all the bureaucracy poppycock. Soon, the aftereffects cost his job and marriage, while his car still being towed again and again. Finally, he loads his car with explosives and the final towing blows up the towed-car lot. But Szifr\u00f3n prepares a happy-ish ending for the tale, as the explosion is accurately calculated to avoid any casualties, and his bold behaviour is regarded as a potent testimony to decry DMV's money-extorting towing policy, he becomes an urban hero thanks to the social media, he gets the sobriquet \"Dynamite\", his wife and daughter visit him in prison for his birthday with all the inmates and prison guards hailing for him. Darin is so compelling as the good-gone- bad stereotype pushed to his limit by a despondent reality. The final revelation is a bit far- fetched and too much a wishful thinking, but it educates us, revenge needs meticulous calculation. The fifth story is \"The Proposal\", a rich kid cries for help from his parents after a hit-and-run accident leaving a pregnant woman died, the father (Mart\u00ednez) buys off his gardener (de Silva) to bear the blame, but when a greedy lawyer (N\u00fa\u00f1ez) and a police prosecutor (Vel\u00e1zquez) are involved, it evolves into a game of shameless blackmail, when those three all up their profits, the canny father abruptly turns the table and uses this case as a bargaining chip to regain the initiative (this smart move shows how Szifr\u00f3n is a sharp observer and an acute thinker in his storytelling), but no one can predict an unexpected denouement. This is my favourite one, it purposefully blurs the line between the opposing sides of rich and poor, and when facing a windfall, human's avariciousness is impartially triggered albeit of their different backgrounds and social status, someone is more adroit at it, and for someone it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, alas, it is the most detrimental original sin in us and we should all constantly being reminded to overcome it. In this chapter, we learn that revenge can be achieved even one is at the apparent disadvantage. Last but not the least, the grand finale is \"Until Death Do Us Apart\", it is at the wedding banquet of Romina (Rivas) and Ariel (Gentile), they seem to be a perfect couple, until Romina's one unintentional glance prompts the most sensitive antenna - a woman's sixth sense, she finds out that Ariel has cheated on her with one of the wedding guest. Subsequently, she vents her ire and dismay by having sex with a random staff in the kitchen as a requital, which is witnessed by Ariel, afterwards, the wedding descends into a madcap buffoonery, yet no one can expect, all the mess actually hones up to a perfect foreplay for the pair, the story ends when the two engage into a passionate sexual intercourse in front of all the guests. Rivas is blazingly radiant in the wedding dress, with her tear-tainted make- up, she refuses to be a runaway bride, instead, she fights back to get even.

We rail against the politicians who misgovern us, the bureaucrats we tangle with, or simply against a world that does not always support our desires. Most express their anger in socially acceptable ways, others do not. It is the others that are the subject of Argentine director Dami\u00e1n Szifr\u00f3n's (On Probation) Wild Tales, six unrelated stories filled with dark humor, stylized violence, unhinged emotions, and unexpected twists in the Twilight Zone tradition, tales that reflect the insanity of contemporary existence.Produced by Pedro Almodovar (I'm Not Excited) and nominated for an Oscar for Best Foreign Film, the assortment of characters that populate Wild Tales are not poster boys for forgiveness but are united in their desire for revenge against real or imagined enemies. Though in films of this genre, the expectation is that some segments will be better than others, here each twenty-minute segment is so impeccably written and compelling that they could each form the basis for a feature-length film. In \"Pasternak,\" the bizarre episode that opens the film, Isabel (Maria Marull, Antes del estreno), an attractive model, boards a plane for a business trip and strikes up a conversation with Salgado (Dario Grandinetti, Inevitable), a music critic, seated across the aisle. After she tells him about her ex-boyfriend Gabriel Pasternak, he tells her that he also knows him as an aspiring classical music composer.Salgado relates how he emphatically rejected one of his compositions, though he recognizes his words may have hurt. Other passengers overhear the conversation and stand up to claim that they also know Pasternak and have mistreated him in one way or another. The sequence ends on a note that is so delightfully macabre that it cannot and should not be described but must be seen. In \"The Rats,\" the film's second vignette, a waitress (Julieta Zylberberg, Extra\u00f1os en la noche) in a restaurant encounters a nasty customer (Cesar Bordon, History of Fear) whom she recognizes as the loan shark who was responsible for her father's suicide.She would like him to suffer but is unwilling to do anything about it until her determined cook (Rita Cortese, Verdades, Verdaderes, la vida de Estala), speaking from experience, tells the waitress that prison is not so bad after all and decides to take matters into her own hand. Revenge escalates in \"Road to Hell,\" a road-rage segment reminiscent of Steven Spielberg's Duel. A well-to-do man (Leonardo Sbaraglia, Aire libre), driving an upscale Audi sports car on a lonely stretch of road, has some choice remarks for the driver (Walter Donado, The Road to San Diego) of a slow-moving pickup truck who refuses to let him pass. Called a \"redneck,\" the fun starts when the businessman has a flat tire and the confrontation escalates in very imaginative and bloody ways.Other stories deal with an engineer (Ricardo Darin, Violet) whose car is towed away once too often for his emotional well being, and a wealthy father (Oscar Martinez, Empty Nest) who tries to cover up for his teenage son's involvement in a fatal automobile accident with a scheme that involves payoffs to his lawyer, the family gardener, the prosecuting attorney and the police. The final segment, \"Till Death Us Do Part,\" is, both literally and figuratively, the icing on the cake. In the episode, a lavish wedding becomes sidetracked when the bride Romina (Erica Rivas, Aire libre) discovers that her new husband and Ariel (Diego Gentile, The Hush) had an affair with one of the wedding guests.The wedding bouquet becomes a dart thrown in several directions as the celebration turns into a mixture of blood and wedding cake. The most commercially successful Argentine movie in history, Wild Tales is a wild ride that provides the viewer with a sense of how losing control may be cathartic and fun on a movie screen but counterproductive in our own life. As one of the characters in the film says, it may be better to just accept that bureaucracy will find a way to get most of your money no matter what and move on with your life, because in that way you'll live longer than if you give the unfairness of the matter any prolonged thought.

As the flight continues, as others overhear the first two talking, they all share a link to the failed musician. The ending is great; funny and sick at the same time. Story number two concerns a waitress at a diner who serves a customer who in the past has caused her much misery. He is a nasty politician and, oh boy, does she serve justice.

An arrogant jerk in a new Audi is driving down a road when he gets stuck behind an old car weaving back and forth.

A lesson in greed is the moral. The final segment is a huge wedding party where the newlywed bride discovers that her husband has cheated on her with a guest at the reception.

It's entertaining, thought provoking at times, but not by a long mile, a master piece. The third short is the most exciting. I would have much preferred this story to have been a main feature length road movie. It captures beautifully the lush landscapes of Argentina, underscored by an 80s Giorgio Moroder music soundtrack. Leonardo Sbraglia is excellent in the lead and so is the insane brute, hot on his heels.By the end of this third short however, the film has climaxed. And there's still more than 1,5 hours to follow. How is that time going to be filled? More shorts follow where the corruption of humans is exposed and offset against pitch black humour. They are criticisms against sick modern day over-bureaucratic societies, in this case Argentina (but it could be transposed to most other parts of the world). It shows how people create hell for each other; and how some puncture that infernal catch 22 to cathartic effect. It does a decent enough job at it. The 6th and last short film is a relentless frenzy of noise and visual chaos, and fittingly so, the story is also a convoluted mess. Unfortunately this short is the longest of them all.

A wide (kinda) release for a Spanish language film, that's sub-titled, in a region such as this, where even film festivals struggle to find an audience (other than for 'those' 'specialty' flicks). Needless to say, anything that supposedly corrupts audience members in this region has been excised, so you can be sure that your moral compass remains intact even after viewing the sinful acts committed by the main leads in the 6 shorts that unfold.The first one, beginning something as a slow-burn dramatic thriller, was the perfect kinda short to grab everyone's attention by the eyeballs with its pitch-perfect/ironically poetic denouement.The 2nd one, consistently enough, continues the introduced theme of revenge, while being consistently slow-burn enough, ends with an appropriate (although a tad lesser) display of irony.The 3rd one, on the other hand, plays out like Steven Spielberg's 'Duel', or 'Joyride', and is very tight, perhaps the tightest of the bunch, and very effective. Overarching the theme of revenge, and a huge touch of irony towards its final sequences, especially, make it really special, almost dominating the very strong initial short.This almost immediately leads into the 4th segment - almost the longest of them all, and sets up the main lead as a lone/reluctant crusader against the typical stuff one Has to Put Up With nowadays, a la 'Falling down', or its local cousin, 'Dombivli Fast'. however, in spite of the time spent in characterization and the ironic sense of revenge, and pride, I felt it was the weakest of the bunch, since there was no sense of a hard payoff. However, this one had the strongest lead of them all, the Argentine De Niro - Ricardo Darin (Carancho / El secreto de sus ojos). The one that comes next though, sweeps aside the theme of revenge, but follow up on a theme introduced in its previous segment, Bombita, of a corrupt system allowing certain perpetrators of crime not to pay the price, for a (ahem) price. The sense of irony, though, is at its strongest in the narrative of this segment, especially when one of the characters who's been meek and kinda cowed down by circumstances starts exhibiting atypical responses, that lead to...ahem...you gotta watch it, and enjoy it.The final segment, embraces irony completely, and keeps you guessing right until its denouement, while eschewing revenge (umm, some might say its all about that emotion though - not for me) almost completely in favor of something even nastier, cutting-edge, and something that hurts immediately, right out in the open, almost completely naked (emotion).

The film is divided into six segments, each with its own plot and character development. Director Damian Szifron is like a modern-day Guy de Maupassant, telling each story with meticulous accuracy, carefully measuring out each twist, detail and conversation. The segments are hilarious and over the top, but at the same time satirical and somehow realistic - the extreme events could happen to any of us. That's why this is such a great film: its shows the darkest side of human nature and of Argentinian society, but in such a way that it makes you smile. The director claims the theme connecting the stories is 'the joy of losing control'. It's also the tag-line of the movie: 'We can all lose control'. Indeed, most of the segments are about losing control, although one is about keeping everything under control in a situation that can easily spin out of control. In any case, all segments are about individuals solving a conflict in an extreme way. In most segments, the solution is extremely violent or deadly. Although the trailer splashes out the name 'Almodovar' because Pedro and his brother produced the film, the style is by no means Almodovar-like. Szafron uses a sophisticated style, very different from the extreme cinematography we know from Almodovar. 'Relatos Salvajes' also surprises with original cinematographic gimmicks. In one scene, the camera is positioned in an overhead bin of an airplane. In another, in the interior of an ATM, with the image filmed through the touch screen. The film is carefully constructed, with lots of little details. In one segment, about a man fighting the parking ticket bureaucracy in his city, we see the conspicuous towing trucks constantly moving through the image, as a sort of evil force.

I find it hard to review these anthology films at times considering some of the short stories work really well while others don't. In Wild Tales, Szifron manages to structure the film beautifully into six stories with a great sense of pacing and storytelling. The two hours flew by and I never found any of the stories tedious or boring. When making an anthology it is important that you establish an important connection between each story, and Szifron manages to do just that. Each story focuses on characters who in some way seem to lose control and act out on impulse or revenge. It's a film about our reactions and how we can behave as animals at times. Szifron manages to set a dark tone in each of his stories while keeping the audience in suspense during some scenes and exploding in laughter during others. It is a perfect example of a dark comedy that manages to maintain the thrills throughout the narrative. Szifron plays with the genre conventions and balances the different tones of the film very well. It's hard to point out a weak link because each story brings something different to the film, but at the same time they all feel connected. Szifron cleverly satirizes different institutions in each of his six segments including marriage, justice, bureaucracy, and social classes. Wild Tales is a well executed and entertaining film, and one that might turn out to be a contender at next year's Oscars. One major issue with anthology films is that since they are separate short stories we get little time to invest in each of the characters, but somehow Szifron manages to establish each character in each scenario so well that we end up caring for them. The performances are all solid. The only familiar face in the cast is Ricardo Darin who delivers his segment extremely well. He plays a disillusioned character who is tired of the bureaucracy in his country. It doesn't take much to see him explode and we see how one small incident escalates into an overblown reaction. As much as I enjoyed that segment, it wasn't the most memorable one. I was a huge fan of the road rage segment, which in my opinion was the highlight of this film. Juan Pablo Colombo and Walter Donado give terrific performances as they are placed on an everyday scenario in the road which very quickly escalates into cartoonish violence.

Granted, the format IS the movie; but we've seen coral stories work much better with the thematic cord weaving it into one common paste without abrupt cuts (Crash, Pulp Fiction). The division of short stories can be as rewarding as it is conflicting: some stories are better than others (which ones are subjective to the viewer, you).

The better stories need more time and the worst ones have too much of it.In my case, I thought the wedding one was too much, and the airplane too little. Almost certainly this unevenness will compute to other viewers with their own particular tastes, who will prefer the whole over the parts if they adore it and divide the parts from the whole if they didn't. Although there is a common subject, and it is quite evident; I felt displaced when a story ended and another began. Unfilled. They weren't all in the same quality league (acting, pace, themes) and as such it felt like puzzle pieces some too big and some too small.The whole is approved, no doubt.
