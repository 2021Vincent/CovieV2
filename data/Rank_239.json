The story follows a young woman who marries a wealthy widower, only to find herself haunted by the memory of his first wife, the beautiful and enigmatic Rebecca.The film boasts superb performances from its cast, particularly Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs. De Winter and Judith Anderson as the sinister Mrs. Danvers. The cinematography is stunning, with breathtaking shots of the rugged Cornish coastline and the grandeur of Manderley, the de Winter family estate.But what makes \"Rebecca\" truly special is its complex exploration of themes such as obsession, jealousy, and the power of memory. As the story unfolds, the audience is drawn deeper into the web of secrets and lies that surround Rebecca's death, until the final, shocking revelation.Overall, \"Rebecca\" is a must-watch for fans of classic cinema, and anyone who appreciates a good mystery with a touch of romance. Don't miss this timeless masterpiece from one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.Fun fact: \"Rebecca\" was the first Hollywood film directed by Alfred Hitchcock, and earned him his first Academy Award nomination for Best Director.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "\"Rebecca (1940): A Classic Tale of Mystery, Romance, and Intrigue\"", "date": "2023-05-07T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9039418", "sentiment score": [0.0036, 0.027, 0.2947, 0.5944, 0.0804]}, {"content": "This movie was one of the best I have seen in a while. To start, it did not stimulate the viewer, as most modern films do with sex or fantastical CGI. Further, this film has an excellent plot which kept me in suspense nearly every moment of the movie. Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs. De Winter was especially great at depicting the part of the new, innocent wife who initially must live in the shadow of the first Mrs. De Winter know as \"Rebecca.\" Hitchcock does a great job of using the scenery, especially the symbol of the ocean in the film. My only complaints were that some scenes seemed drawn out or somewhat unnecessary, especially at the beginning, and there are a few instances of obviously fake old-school type acting (in one scene Maxim--Mr. De Winter--\"punches\" someone and then there is no mark on the other fellow's face).", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Excellent Plot and Acting, Nice Setting, Long Scenes", "date": "2023-04-28T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9021817", "sentiment score": [0.0011, 0.0042, 0.0476, 0.7298, 0.2174]}, {"content": "Dazzled by All About Eve (1950-also reviewed),I was thrilled to discover that a second title Dan Murrell had picked for Movie Club, was one which unknown to me, also starred George Sanders, which led to me getting ready to meet Rebecca.View on the film:Swooning in with the belief that he has all the answers at his fingertips, George Sanders gives a marvelous turn as Favell, whose suave over- confidence is gradually cut down by Sanders, when it sinks into Favell that he's been barking up the wrong tree, over the events surrounding Rebecca's disappearance.Telling the director on set that the lead actress was \"Terrible\", and revealed in the audio commentary from Leonard J. Leff, that after Vivien Leigh (who he was having an affair with) did not get the lead role, the actor spent the whole production sulking over it, which results in all these backstage issues, fittingly seeping into Laurence Olivier's performance as Maxim, who when bringing his new bride back to the mansion, is given a cold shoulder aloofness by Olivier, who drills into Maxim's stance,when he turns his back, in order to leave his wife isolated in the darkest corner of the manor home.Detailed in the excellent book Alfred Hitchcock:A Life In Darkness And Light by Patrick McGilligan that the actress first caught the attention of producer David O. Selznick, when as George Cukor's dinner date at Charlie Chaplin's house, she mentioned that she had just finished reading the thrilling novel Rebecca, Joan Fontaine gives an exquisite performance as Mrs. De Winter, thanks to Fontaine subtly expressing in her body language the shiver that goes down Mrs. De Winter's back, while exploring the ghostly silent mansion of Rebecca, which Fontaine crosses with a shadow of a doubt, as Mrs. De Winter's begins to pick away at the statement's on Rebecca's disappearance.Only appearing for 20 minutes, and told not to blink by the director, Judith Anderson gives an utterly chilling performance as Mrs. Danvers. Not shown walking in any shot, Anderson embodies the ghostly presence of Rebecca, who stands in the household as a woman in black entwined to the spirit of the house, to the point where the only thing that could break her eerie glances from the window, is her soul burning away,at the heart of the home.Travelling to the US in order to make a movie about the Titanic that ended up sinking before filming began, at the same time as Mrs. De Winters traveled to Manderley, un- credited co-writer / directing auteur Alfred Hitchcock & The Spanish Main (1945-also reviewed) cinematographer George Barnes (the first of two times they worked together) beautifully capture the decaying state of Maxim and de Winter's marriage, with high, pulled back shots covering the miles between the couple across the cold dining table.Whilst he would decades later take a rather negative view of the project in his discussions with fellow film maker Francois Truffaut, (who was a fan of the movie) with him saying that \"It's not a Hitchcock picture,it's a novelette, really\" and when pointed out that this film by him won the Best Picture Oscar, stating \"I did not get the Oscar, Mr. Selznick did.\" Hitchcock masterfully lays out his major recurring themes and motifs from the jolt of vertigo that grips Maxim looking down at the crashing waves, which spirals out to refine deep focus long shots sipping at the blonde Mrs. De Winter's isolated in the vast empty rooms of a home haunted by the memories of Rebecca.Becoming one of Hitchcock's longest films, from the huge challenges it faced, from Fontaine extensively having to re-record her dialogue, to David O. Selznick going behind Hitchcock's back, in order to promise to novelist Daphne Du Maurier that it would be a faithful adaptation under his watch, the resulting screenplay by Hitchcock, Robert E. Sherwood,Joan Harrison,Philip MacDonald,Michael Hogan and un-credited \"Story Editor\" / future major Horror producer Val Lewton, remarkably hold everything together.The writers delicacy brew in Mrs. De Winters fearful dialogue and servant Mrs. Danvers undying loyalty to Rebecca, creating the aura of a ghost, without overtly fading to Horror, which frees the writers to twirl the knife into razor-sharp Thriller twists which unveil the true feelings of Maxim to Rebecca,and the tragic events which haunted Rebecca,on the long road to Manderley.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "\"I can't forget what it's done to you.

However, while the film is certainly entertaining, it falls far short of the masterful pieces of Hitchcock's later career and is, in fact, overrated.One of the primary issues with \"Rebecca\" is the implausibility of its story setup. It is hard to believe that a stunningly attractive girl like Rebecca would marry someone for their wealth without any emotional interest whatsoever, especially when she could marry anyone who had both wealth and whom she might love. Furthermore, it seems improbable that Maxim de Winter would not have the faintest clue that Rebecca was a cruel, evil monster before marrying her. Additionally, it is difficult to believe that de Winter would leave the management of his entire estate to someone as stereotypically cruel and obviously insane as Mrs. Danvers.While some other aspects of the story are explained in the film, such as why de Winter did not simply get divorced to save himself from suffering, these explanations still feel barely believable. The acting does not help matters, as never for a moment does one feel that de Winter is genuinely in love with his second wife - who in turn comes across as extremely naive and silly, even if her daunted timidity is well portrayed. Meanwhile, Mrs. Danvers is portrayed more as a fairytale witch than a real person. The list goes on.Moreover, the police investigation and the ad-hoc incrimination by Mr. Favell have nothing to do with any sort of reality. You might argue this is consistent with the overall mystic-nightmarish ambience of the movie. But as a psychothriller, it is psychologically way out of line. Perhaps it might have worked better as a gothic tale or horror film.Finally, the film is permanently drenched in a cheesy sauce of music, which becomes annoying after a while.While \"Rebecca\" is undoubtedly worth watching as a classic of the genre, it is not a must-see film in Hitchcock's oeuvre.", "rating": 6, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 4}, "heading": "Worth watching, but not one of Hitchcock's masterpieces", "date": "2023-03-24T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8947814", "sentiment score": [0.0626, 0.6667, 0.2311, 0.0362, 0.0034]}, {"content": "What can I say about Rebecca?

The viewer is constantly pushed out of the reverie of the tale by the constant intrusion of the director. He grasps for technical brilliancies and destroys the flow of the story. After a few minutes one is longing for Wilder or George Stevens, directors who wisely let their actors dominate scenes instead of intruding with these gaudy tricks. Throughout his career, Hitchcock frequently wrecked scenes by over-directing, and much of \"Rebecca\" is over-directed.Olivier gives a fine performance, not as nuanced as his other 1940 performance, that of Mr. Darcy in the lighthearted take of \"Pride and Prejudice,\" but it would be difficult to think of an actor more equipped for the part of the massively depressed, obsessive, de Winter. Olivier assumes and assimilates and owns the role, displaying a masterly change of personality while away from the great house at Mandalay.Fontaine on the other hand, is only adequate in a very strongly written role. Unlike Olivier, Fontaine does not give the sense that nobody could replace her in this part. Easily a half dozen of her contemporaries would have done the part as admirably: Bergman or Joan Bennett or Fontaine's sister Olivia deHavilland are all examples; Claudette Colbert would have created a masterpiece with this role, although studio heads were jugheadedly insistent on typecasting actresses.A good quality melodrama, but not more than that.", "rating": 4, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 4}, "heading": "hitchcock's camera and then all the rest", "date": "2022-11-27T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8696993", "sentiment score": [0.0403, 0.4446, 0.4519, 0.0607, 0.0026]}, {"content": "It is difficult to add, at this late date, to the many excellent reviews of this motion picture.

He was far more natural, somewhat debonair and suave and actually quite handsome.

A bit of a tyrant and with a temper, it's hard to see what the appeal was apart from his face and money. I could understand his depression, his mourning and \"Other\" issues, but he was really quite unnecessarily horrible to his poor new wifey.He was never very complimentary about the woman that he supposedly loved and treated her like a second class citizen, which was probably a reflection of the time in which Du Maurier wrote the original book and may be a comment, on her part, about the way the world was unequal.Initially I did find that it was definitely a whirlwind romance, as these older films and stories so often were and because of that it did seem a stretch to believe, especially when they returned to Mandalay and his treatment of her was not the kindest.A relationship where the previous partner is still present in the new one is always difficult, but this was just obscure, like some sort of ghost worshipping cult, especially old lady Danvers who was obsessive.You could almost imagine that Danvers was a disgruntled former wife or THE first Mrs De Winter (Only pretending to be dead) in a disguise, because of the way that she behaved.In a strange way I felt that there were similarities in the story to 'Beauty And The Beast' (1991), except that Angela Lansbury's, Mrs Potts wasn't such a frightening old hag and Belle had a bit more going for her.

After a quick courtship, Maxim brings his new bride back to his home of Manderly, but the spirit of his first wife, as well as one servant's- Mrs. Danvers- inability to forget Rebecca. But what really happened to her? Where did she go, and why are some people unwilling to forget, yet others not wanting to remember? Watch the film.It's not a thriller in the conventional sense- there's no threat, no one is trying to kill any of the main characters, no one is descending into mental illness. The film achieves its effect by having the spirit of the first Mrs. De Winter loom over the picture, largely and heavily. You never see any pictures of her on the walls, never see her in any flashbacks- yet she still dominates the picture. She is only mentioned by name, and her room is still preserved, but she creates an uneasy atmosphere.Judith Anderson, who played Mrs. Danvers, also adds to the uneasiness. Obsessed with the titular Rebecca, and unwelcoming towards the second Mrs. De Winter (Joan Fontaine), she is cold and calculating, like a snake. She doesn't even blink. Laurence Olivier is also quite creepy as Maxim de Winter, which he isn't supposed to be, but as the film goes on, he becomes more likable. Joan Fontaine is much better here than any other film I've seen her in- she plays one of her usual meek and mild characters, but is more meek and mild than usual. I do feel that she overdid her character's patheticness in the beginning, but with some of the other characters present and her seeming inability to ever replace Rebecca, it is understandable and I don't mind it at all.Alfred Hitchcock directs the film very well, very skillfully, much better than he would direct some of his later, more highly regarded films, adding a Gothic touch to the romance/suspense without letting his actors descend into camp. As I mentioned above, the set design is very good, the house making one feel claustrophobic despite the large, Victorian-style rooms. I did feel that the film went on a bit too long, not that it overstayed its welcome, but rather that the courtship between Larry and Joan could have been shorter, as it didn't hold my attention very much. On the flip side, the ending is fabulous, and unexpected (even better if you don't read the spoilers), but what happened to Rebecca is different from the book to the movie- liked what happened in the book better, but this was the production code era, so they had to make that part moralistic.Overall, recommended, but it helps to get to know Joan Fontaine and Larry Olivier before watching- they're both acquired tastes.

You really need subtitles/closed captioning to understand him in this film. I found Olivier nearly impossible to understand without subtitles--and not necessarily because of his accent, but because he constantly mumbles, merges words together, and is basically incoherent except when he's angry and shouting. Plus, he's totally detached and unemotional and speaks too fast in a cold tone even in the scenes where he's supposed to be falling in love with Joan Fontaine's character. Olivier's performance was very disappointing, and I think just about any other major leading man of that era could have played the role of Maxim de Winter better than he did.

And he made lots of them thankfully. I finally came around watching this one - just before I went ahead and watched the \"remake\" that Netflix released last year. I put \"remake\" in quotes because the movie itself does try to establish itself as being based on the source novel.Now I have not read that, so I can't attest to all the changes that were made (although one was made for the ratings board considering the fate of Rebecca - and that was also used in the Remake).

But I've written so much and have not even touched the surface of what makes this movie great.You have a movie that is about the role of a woman - a second wife no less.

On the other hand the extras here and some feminist claim the exact opposite. Even in his (infamous) interview with Truffaut, some might say it became clear he was more feminist than he liked to admit.And the movie right here seems to be able to capture many feelings of women. Even add some bi-sexual or lesbian love? You could read that into it - maybe it is in the book too. Again, I can't really tell.Every frame here is planned into the smallest detail. Nothing is left to chance and coincidence. There is a reason he is considered a master. The performances of the couple is amazing - Olivier may not be easy to read, but that is again on purpose.You also have the whole theme of romance and the age gap ... love, betrayal, addiction ... so many themes woven in here.

There's the real suspense that leaves me hanging mind air wondering. We don't know her face, figure, style, mannerisms, facade, personality.

Judith Anderson also sets the bar high with the first in a series of excellent Mrs-Danvers-performances (followed by Diana Rigg and, more recently, Kristin Scott Thomas).Although it works well as an adaptation of the novel, it's not a Hitchcock film that I find myself returning to again and again. His trademark playfulness is notably absent, and it also suffers from the irritating 1940s habit of playing orchestral music in the background of almost every single scene. If Hitchcock hadn't made his signature cameo - walking in the background of Jack Favell bickering with a police officer - you probably wouldn't immediately detect that it was directed by him.Despite being an early work, should Hitchcock really have reflected on this film with a grimace later in his career?

I have no idea why. There are so many brilliant Hitchcock flicks that should have won best picture but this film is definitely not one of them. I wont go into full detail of the plot so a quick summary is that a shy insecure poor young woman played by Hitchcock alum Joan Fontaine meets rich widowed Max de Winter played by the Shakespearean elite Laurence Olivier. Both fall in love and they quickly get married. He then brings her to his huge English estate called Manderley and soon the new wife quickly finds out that Max can't seem to get over his first wife whose name was Rebecca - yup she dead. And theres this weird possible evil housekeeper Mrs. Danvers who loved the first wife, Rebecca - the one true Mrs. De Winter and doesn't want anyone to take her place. Interesting? It took me 4 or 5 times to get through this film. The funny thing is you do not know Fontaine's character who is the narrator in the beginning of the flick. The film is slow and mediocre and there are stale performances in particular from Olivier, I just couldn't see the engagement. Fontaine is the opposite, she is completely over-the-top especially when she yells out \"Maxim, Maximmmmm!!\" The chemistry between the two characters is horrible and awkward. The lady who plays Danvers does well in tormenting the new Mrs de Winter by showing her all the important things that belonged to the late Rebecca. But what really turned me off was the movie was wayyyy too slow and too long and some scenes felt repetitive especially when the flick takes small steps.

The former obviously has a lot to do with the style and wit of the great Alfred Hitchcock, but also with it's producer, David O Selznick, who insisted on a faithful treatment of Daphne Du Maurier's novel. Hitchcock was often rather unfaithful to Source material and taking Du Maurier as an example this was sometimes a good thing (The Birds) and sometimes, a bad (Jamaica Inn). As to the cinematography, DOP George Barnes does a masterly job with moonlit images of the gothic Manderley and the rain reflected on the walls so they appear to be weeping, amongst many incredibly striking images. These are underscored and augmented hugely by Franz Waxman who provides an incredible music score and then there is the casting. Joan Fontaine from her opening voice over of the novel's first line, gives us a character who breaks our hearts and we empathise with her in every moment as a loveable, endearing and naive young women at the start to the strong, indomitable heroine at the end-what a journey and a masterclass of acting. Laurence Olivier is an aristocratic, brooding Maxim De Winter that partners Fontaine perfectly and the rest of the cast bats all the way down. Judith Anderson is one of the coldest and most intimidating characters on screen as Mrs Danvers and no one does a cad better than George Sanders as the oily but charismatic Jack Favell. Gladys Cooper and Nigel Bruce as the Laceys have brilliant chemistry together and bring immense warmth and humour to the film and Florence Bates is unforgettable as the dragon lady, Mrs Van Hopper, monstrous and hilarious. For my money this first American film of Hitchcock's is his greatest and indeed one of the very finest films ever made. In a word, perfection.

To begin with, the picture focuses on a whirlwind romance between the nameless protagonist and a rich recluse who's haunted by the enigmatic existence of his eponymous ex-wife. It feels sort of like a romantic comedy here, with only a few hints of darkness seeping into the fray, and its aesthetics are rather light and, for want of a better term, fluffy. It also culminates in one of the worst marriage proposals ever, a declaration of love disguised as an insult. The second act is by far the feature's most successful, focusing on the protagonist's attempts to acclimatise to the vast halls and large staff found in her new home, all while feeling pressured to live a certain responsibility-ridden, rich-blooded lifestyle as the 'lady of the house'. It's a lonely, mysterious and somewhat gothic fish-out-of-water segment that does a fantastic job of putting you in the new Mrs. de Winter's position. It's also the part in which the haunting, almost otherworldly presence of the deceased yet incomparable Rebecca is most keenly felt. The icy air that hangs over the house and its inhabitants belies the fact that this is, in essence, a ghost story, which gives the piece an interesting texture and lends it an air of suspenseful unpredictability. The movie's final third takes place after what you initially presume to be its big, reveal-ridden finale. It turns into a sort of courtroom drama/ police procedural and is much more focused on delivering information, albeit in an intriguing and well-conceived way. It lacks the almost ethereal vibe that the second act is soaked in, feeling much more in-the-moment and, in a way, straightforward. Of course, this segment isn't bad. It just feels as though it could have been refined somewhat and arguably isn't all that necessary in the grand scheme of things. Still, the conclusion is satisfying.

It's a typical Hollywood coupling of an older man, Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier)--in this case a widower--with a younger and inexperienced woman (Joan Fontaine). She's presumably a virgin before they meet, but, more than that, for most of the picture, she's entirely submissive and unsure of herself. She has so little identity beyond constantly being afraid and her devotion to her husband that she's never even given a name until she's married, becoming the second Mrs. De Winter. Orphaned, she leaves the employ of one mother figure to marry a stand-in for her other deceased parent. This is precisely what Maxim adores about her, too, as he orders her to never be 36 years old and laments what a pity it is that she has to \"grow up.\" The Oscar-nominated Fontaine nails \"that funny young lost look,\" too, that her fatherly husband wishes to preserve. The great mystery of this Gothic romance turns out to be that Maxim didn't love his first wife precisely because the gendered roles were reversed--him inexperienced and Rebecca unsubmissive and sexually promiscuous. It's the old chestnut of punishing women for sexual infidelity, which, as it involves her cousin (George Sanders), also takes on an incestuous quality this time--and not of the sort condoned in the father-and-child dynamic of the second marriage--to go along with a hint of gay panic and queer bashing over the subtextual lesbianism between Rebecca and Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) and the threat thereof between Mrs. Danvers and the second Mrs. De Winter.The value of this underpinning ideology of enforcing heterosexual patriarchy aside, all of that surely makes for a sensational read by Daphne du Maurier, as does its genre hopping, as pointed out by Don Ranvaud, from fairy tale to mystery to detective story, but as the 2020 adaptation evidences, not necessarily a great movie. It would also be par for the course for an Alfred Hitchcock film, but, fortunately, it's also one of the strongest pictures visually in his oeuvre. And in the career of David O. Selznick, as it's been oft reported that the two men battled over the production as if the conflict between the Mrs. De Winters on screen were merely an abstraction for the real-world control of the artistic direction. Auteur theory has been kind to Hitchcock, but don't forget that before winning Best Picture for \"Rebecca,\" Selznick was awarded another the previous year for an epic, \"Gone with the Wind\" (1939), that wasn't authored by any particular director at all, with the vision of the producer, Selznick, as well as that of the newly-designated production designer, being of more import.As others have mentioned, from the Criterion Collection home-video commentary by scholar Leonard J. Leff, to comparative videos on the web, \"Rebecca\" bares striking visual similarities with the next year's \"Citizen Kane\" (1941). Both begin with virtuosic shots trespassing through gates to the enclosed estates, each represented by some nice exterior miniature work and matte paintings. The camera in this one is made to appear to be going straight through the iron of the barrier. Both end with the \"R\"-marked objects ablaze--taking their secrets with them to their fiery ends. In between, both feature a film-within-the-film that provide a superficial glimpse at their subjects. Both concern the ghosts of their eponymous dead characters. These films are also remarkable in standing out in their day for how they photograph spaces, the architecture.Technically, \"Citizen Kane\" is significantly more ambitious, as it also is in its plot structure--while all we get here is the remembered voiceover narration to deviate from the otherwise ordinary plotting--but \"Rebecca\" remains effective for how felicitous the photography of the architecture of Manderley is to the drama. I love how small Fontaine looks amid those wide shots of those spacious rooms, hallways and staircases--reinforcing how small her character feels psychologically in her new, mysterious environment and in comparison to the first Mrs. De Winter. And how her sense of being lost is reflected in the seemingly labyrinth structure and secret spaces of the property. Lyle R. Wheeler's sets also feature those wonderfully high door knobs that appear at eye level with Fontaine. The seaside location also has the benefit of waves standing in for sex in this production made during the era of the Hays Code.As in \"Kane,\" the gulf within her marriage is represented visually by them sitting on opposite ends of a long dining-room table. Viewing this again after seeing the 2020 remake, there's also more than our learned association through decades of such films with the Gothic that this story looks better in black and white. Never mind the story, one can tell there's something darkly sinister and mysterious afoot by merely looking at the shadows on screen. There's especially a lot of highlighting of eyes--that bar-shaped illumination from masked key lights that I've recently learned has been dubbed \"Shatner lighting,\" but clearly existed before \"Star Trek.\" \"Dracula\" (1931), for one, also features effective use of the technique. In \"Rebecca,\" there's also an emphasis on sunlight slipping through foliage, clouds and fog in the opening tracking shots. Cinematographer George Barnes, being awarded an Oscar after having been nominated at the first two Academy Awards ceremonies, was evidently one of the best in the business--even if \"Rebecca\" also features some atrocious rear-projection composites. The contrast to the exquisite interior camera movements and techniques is stark--even in rear projection. The dimming of the lights on the background figure as Fontaine turns her face in profile in one shot, by contrast, was an effective use of the rear-projection effect. Additionally, besides the opening sequence, one of my favorite tracking shots is the one Maxim narrates of his last interaction with Rebecca, with the camera following the movements of the invisible ghost.The acting helps, too. George Sanders is George Sanders, and I'm a fan of that. I'm less fond of Olivier in this one, although he at least has some evident affection for his wife visible on his face (as opposed to that in the 2020 iteration). To be fair, it's not a great character anyways. Right off the bat, the guy doesn't even wait around after he orders a coffee (the wasted work of the waiter never to be resolved in the film, either, by the way). On the other hand, as should already be apparent, I think Fontaine works well. Were she not, Anderson would've entirely stolen every scene of hers (such is the case, to beat a dead horse, I'm afraid, in the 2020 version), because, boy, she's creepy as Manderley's housekeeper--ever more so when she's also being erotic. The way she handles Rebecca's clothes--from her fur coat, to her underwear, to her see-through fabric caressing the bed--it's as though Mrs. Danvers were undressing Rebecca's ghost in front of the new wife. It doesn't get much more obvious than that in a 1940 Hollywood production, and, if that weren't enough, how about those waves again superimposed over that \"R\" for \"Rebecca,\" as the second Mrs. De Winter recoils from the thought. Interesting, too, in this light, that Danvers may not be so much trying to sabotage the second marriage, including by the Rebecca dress, as to engage the new wife in a similar lesbian affair or to bring back the image of her past love. To top it off, the ending is one of the all-time greats--the fire, the camera movement, and the figure of Danvers.It's the spatial relations of that camera, though, especially in exploring interior space and imbuing the architecture with its own character that is the standout here. It's what other great filmmakers, such as those of \"Kane,\" evidently picked up on. It's what would continue to mark Hitchcock's best films, \"Rear Window\" (1954) and \"Vertigo\" (1958) most among them.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 4}, "heading": "A Haunted House, Incest, Lesbians and Rosebud", "date": "2020-11-01T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6224581", "sentiment score": [0.0237, 0.0991, 0.2413, 0.4844, 0.1515]}, {"content": "After watching Netflix remake of the classic Hitchcock version, I was even more impressed.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 3}, "heading": "Remake flattered original", "date": "2020-10-27T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6211764", "sentiment score": [0.0153, 0.0244, 0.0648, 0.2899, 0.6056]}, {"content": "Why do they ruin it with remakes - sweet, nice music and b&w", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 3}, "heading": "Better than any remake", "date": "2020-10-26T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6207028", "sentiment score": [0.2301, 0.232, 0.209, 0.1694, 0.1595]}, {"content": "Hitchcock's film of REBECCA is an absolute masterpiece compared with the new Netflix Version.

While Hitchcock may have been initially unexcited at having to make a faithful adaptation of a popular novel, he undoubtedly delivers a grand, stylish film which went on to win the Best Film Oscar that year.Literary adherence constraints aside, it seems that Hitchcock was otherwise free to make the film his way without Selznick's usual high level of interference and so very much puts his own mark on the movie, with soon-to-be trademark imaginative lighting and tracking techniques as well as drawing fine performances from his cast. Judith Anderson, for me, steals the show with her \"wicked witch of the east\" turn as the vindictive housekeeper, Mrs Danvers whose twisted love for her former mistress leads her to encourage an innocent young woman to commit suicide. That extended scene with Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs DeWinter is the highlight of the film, her dark costume, wart-bearing face and severe hair-do giving her a demonic presence right out of the Brothers Grimm. Fontaine too is excellent as the hapless new wife, shy, awkward and lacking the personal confidence to fill the mythical Rebecca's glass slippers. Olivier continues his strong, silent persona recently seen in \"Wuthering Heights\" while George Sanders as Rebecca's caddish lover and Gladys Cooper as Fontaine's interfering former-employer are memorable in smaller parts.Like others, I found the turnabout in the characterisations of Olivier and Fontaine too marked where you practically witness a backbone transplant between them at the crisis point in the action just as the pace of the film is slowed to allow the necessary explanations and exposition to finally solve the mystery but it's all worth it just to see the memorable final shots of Anderson flailing about in the flaming inferno of Manderley which will reunite her with her adored mistress.I enjoyed a number of Hitchcock's British-made films but here you get to see what he can do with the support of a major studio and the access it gave him to better writers, technicians and actors.

Selznick. That honestly feels like a step in the right direction. Instead of having an egomaniac try to dictate Hitchcock's own movie to him on set, he only had the egomaniac on the phone and in the editing booth. Reading about Hitchcock up to this point in the timeline of his filmography, this is the first time I've seen his editing in the camera technique mentioned where he only shot exactly what he needed to edit together. So, he didn't have entire scenes playing out across multiple takes, instead he shot what he needed from a particular actor in an exchange at a particular angle and stopped filming. I have to imagine that this was a technique that he developed while working in the studio system in Britain where he had to be as economical as possible. It had the added advantage of preventing Selznick from completely remaking the film in the editing bay. So, despite the stories of how much Selznick wanted to mess with the film, Hitchcock made the film in a way that only minimal messing could happen.Anyway, the film is based on another Daphne du Maurier novel after Hitchcock adapted her Jamaica Inn as his last British picture. This is apparently a much more faithful adaptation of du Maurier's work than the previous film. A young woman is attending Ms. Van Hopper as a paid companion in Monte Carlo when the pair meet the mysterious and very wealthy Maxim de Winter. Ms. Van Hopper, a rather tiresome socialite well past her prime, desperately tries to latch onto Maxim, but the young attendant effortlessly falls into his arms romantically, and the romance blossoms into a quick marriage. The real joy of Ms. Van Hopper is how she quickly morphs from a tiresome bother into a woman of experience as she tells the new Mrs. de Winter that she's entering a world that she does not understand.At Mr. de Winter's residence in Cornwall, Manderley, a gothic mansion on the coast of England, the new Mrs. de Winter meets the house's staff, in particular Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper. This is where it becomes apparent that this is a ghost story. The former Mrs. de Winter, Rebecca, is mentioned in almost every scene. Everyone seems haunted by the mysterious presence of her a year after her disappearance and death, but her former presence affects different people in different ways.Maxim can't bear to hear her name or be reminded of her, and he won't talk about her, leaving his feelings a mystery. Mrs. Danvers, on the other hand, treats Rebecca's name with the utmost reverence. When the new Mrs. de Winter finds her way into Rebecca's old room, Mrs. Danvers touches Rebecca's things like they are holy objects, her brush and pillow case (embroidered with an R) in particular. Mrs. Danvers goes so far as to encourage the new Mrs. de Winter to wear a dress that Rebecca wore to a dress up party a year before in an effort to drive a wedge between her and Maxim.Eventually, Maxim reveals the true past of his relationship to Rebecca and his role in her disappearance to his new bride, a terrible secret that weighs on him heavily and could turn into serious consequences if found out by the right people such as the local sheriff or George Sanders, Rebecca's cousin and lover.What sets this movie apart from everything Hitchcock made up to this point is the maturity. From the basic approach to actors and their performances to framing and to emotion, Rebecca doesn't feel like the work of a man who's most successful movies have been adventure yarns about shadowy organizations doing shadowy things for shadowy reasons. This is a character drama that uses Hitchcock's entire array of technical skills and also manages to fit in thematically while finding places for his telltale sense of suspense. The way the truth gets doled out steadily over time, with questions lingering about motive and desire for main characters with the new Mrs. de Winter as our point of view into this strange little world, is all about building suspense towards the central questions at hand (something that honestly, despite my defense of the film, should have been in Jamaica Inn).The only thing that I have some small reticence over is the final fifteen minutes or so of the film when everything gets revealed. For what it is, a series of reveals that the movie actually did build up towards, it works and has a certain appeal, but it feels more banal than the more Romantic and Gothic film that had preceded it. Again, it's not a bad series of reveals, it just doesn't feel like it quite fits. The final images of the film, though, do fit wonderfully well as the ghost of Rebecca burns away in visual metaphor.This is a sort of greatness that Hitchcock, up to this point, hadn't really been working towards. The films that were meant to be taken more seriously, like Juno and the Paycock and The Skin Game felt as much like quick solutions to the question of talkies from a producer perspective than anything else, and, while The Skin Game is a successful film, it always felt limited visually (due to a few outside reasons Hitchcock had no control over). Working from novels, with greater inherent scope than stage plays, feels like a more natural fit for film in general, and Hitchcock fills the frame really well to fit the story. So, despite some lingering, limited questions of authorship between Hitchcock and Selznick, this does represent a reinvigorated Hitchcock in his new Hollywood home.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 4}, "heading": "Hitchcock comes to Hollywood", "date": "2020-06-29T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5867439", "sentiment score": [0.0408, 0.1972, 0.3498, 0.3606, 0.0516]}, {"content": "\"Rebecca\" was the first American film of Alfred Hitchcock.

Given that latter point, it's perhaps ironic that he would later go on to make much better films: Rebecca, despite its reputation, is not his finest work.\nRebecca is closely based on Daphne du Maurier's novel of the same name, and sees Joan Fontaine's otherwise unnamed second Mrs de Winter meet and marry rich widow Maxim de Winter, only to discover that the shadow of his deceased first wife Rebecca hangs over their marriage. Part romance and part psychological thriller, the story sees the second Mrs de Winter - through whom the plot is focalised - gradually discover the truth about Rebecca's death.\nThe problem with the plot is that it changes direction twice, resulting in an uneven feel to the film. The first half sees the second Mrs de Winter meet Maxim, fall in love, get married, and then find herself somewhat lost in his huge mansion Manderley, which is metaphorically haunted by the spectre of Rebecca. The plot shifts halfway through as we start to discover the truth about what happened to her, and then shifts again for the final quarter, as it transpires that Maxim actually hated his first wife and he ends up in the familiar Hitchcock territory of a man desperately trying to clear his name in the face of wrongful accusations about Rebecca's death. All of which makes the film feel top heavy, with a padded first half and a second half that suddenly introduces new characters, most notably George Sander's caddish Jack Favell.\nThe other problem here is the characterisation. The screenplay is credited to Robert E. Sherwood and Joan Harrison, with adaptation by Philip MacDonald and Michael Hogan, and the involvement of four writers (plus, technically, du Maurier) is perhaps why it is less focused than it could have been. The film's main protagonist the second Mrs de Winter is quite nervous, insecure and basically rather wet during the first half, but suddenly finds new reserves of confidence and determination once she discovers the truth about Rebecca; despite a strong performance from Joan Fontaine, this means she never quite rings true. Similarly, Laurence Olivier's Maxim is by turns cold, warm, distant and vulnerable as the story demands and thus feels less like a real person and more like a function of the plot. Likewise, icy housekeeper Mrs Danvers, who gradually and subtly undermines and persecutes the second Mrs de Winter, suddenly decides to burn Manderley down at the end and kill herself in the process (possibly accidentally) purely out of spite, which feels like a step too far for the character.\nBut despite these faults, there is much to enjoy and admire here. Hitchcock's characteristic directorial flare is apparent throughout, bringing an appropriately Gothic feel to the film which has aged well. Right from opening scenes, George Barnes' award winning cinematography impresses: the second Mrs de Winter's first view of Manderley is through a rain-sodden windscreen, and after the wide-angled, deep-focus shots of the French Riviera scenes, close-ups and other techniques at Manderley make the excellent sets seem oppressive, whilst at the same time enormous and labyrinthine. Franz Waxman's score - added in by producer Selznick during editing - is a bit intrusive at times, but for the most part is memorably atmospheric as the mood of the film darkens. And whatever the flaws of the characterisation, the acting is superb: there's a lengthy scene in which Maxim reveals the truth about Rebecca, and which consists largely of melodramatic dialogue: Olivier's performance and Hitchcock's direction make it tense and absorbing. Judith Anderson is well cast as the intimidating Mrs Danvers, as is George Sanders as Favell and Florence Bates as Mrs. Van Hopper, the second Mrs De Winter's battleaxe of an employer.\nOverall then, Rebecca is perhaps not as a good as its reputation would suggest. Nevertheless, like most Hitchcock films it is worth watching, and is significant for bringing the director to America, where as history has proved, he would go on to make some of his very best films.", "rating": 6, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Enjoyable, but not Hitchcock's finest work", "date": "2020-06-06T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5803395", "sentiment score": [0.0102, 0.1979, 0.5777, 0.2066, 0.0077]}, {"content": "Although Rebecca never appeared, she seemed to control the fate of all the characters in an invisible way, and became a nightmare in everyone's heart.

The great director's first Hollywood production that earned him surprisingly his sole Best Picture Academy Award.The film is based on the novel Rebecca by Daphne Du Maurier a classic story that is brought to the big screen in a great adaptation by the master of suspense stories Hitchcock along with the studio backing of producer David O. Selznick who had produced another screen success Gone With The Wind the year previously.The film has 4 great elements. 1 - Casting. Laurence Olivier plays English aristocrat Maxim de Winter who owns a lavish property in Cornwall, U.K. called Manderley. de Winter is haunted by the mysterious death of his first wife Rebecca de Winter the year previously in an apparent drowning accident at sea. de Winter begins the film vacationing In Monte Carlo where he meets a young and nameless female companion to the rude Edythe Van Hopper. The young companion is played by Joan Fontaine. In a whirlwind romance Maxim and Fontaine's character engage to marry and later return to the de Winter residence Manderley. It is here that the story develops as the staff of Maxim especially servant Mrs. Danvers have an air of suspicion (unfairly comparing her to the beloved Rebecca) about the second Mrs. de Winter. Mrs. Danvers is played excellently by Judith Anderson and as the film develops gets more nasty and evil not only in her demeanor but her actions.2 - Photography. The film is shot in the standard black and white of the time but has the haunting look especially of Manderley meant to portray the spirit of Rebecca.3 - Direction. Hitchcock himself is the master of building up suspense before the foul play ending. So what is the foul play ending? Of course it is to do with Rebecca's death. It becomes apparent that the original verdict of cause of death could be wrong. Hitchcock keeps the viewer glued to the story throughout!4 - Production values - Hollywood offered Hitchcock an elevation in the production values of his films from the pretty mediocre level he had enjoyed in England. The special effects in this film include fantastic miniatures of Manderley. Special effects became a trademark of Hitchcock films in later years. Selznick's contribution towards the production is obvious and rightly earned the film a Best Picture Oscar. The only element missing from this film is lack of humour. The gloomy novel put paid to that. However the performances of the cast make up for it. The mood swings of Mr. de Winter could have been an insight into the demands of Olivier backstage?

Due to this being a favorite film of both my mother and my grandmother, I have seen it well over a dozen times through the years. It never fails to impress me.In many ways, this feels like two movies in one: the first part involves the unnamed second Mrs. De Winter (played by a ravishingly lovely Joan Fontaine) trying to settle into her role as the new mistress of Manderley and the second part involves discovering the suspicious circumstances behind Rebecca's death. Fontaine really only gets to do much of anything in the initial half as her meek character grows a backbone and matures. By the time her arc is over, so too is her time as the protagonist (notice how she is not present for the scene where we finally learn just what was up with Rebecca). This makes the movie feel a little disjointed, but it's too small a flaw in the grand scheme of what the movie does well.There's gothic and then there's GOTHIC-- the cinematography of this film is pure chiaroscuro, drenching that old mansion in shadows. Fontaine is often dwarfed inside of Manderley, emphasizing her displacement and the power of the past over the future. Franz Waxman's score is gorgeous, romantic, and ghostly.All of the actors give great performances (I almost forgot to mention Laurence Olivier as the tormented Maxim de Winter, a character I admit I find broderline insufferable in the first half of the movie), but my favorites are George Sanders as Rebecca's \"favorite cousin\" Jack and Judith Anderson as the wonderfully creepy Mrs. Danvers, an illustration of the old idea that love makes people do the darndest things. Even with the Production Code firmly in place, her erotic fascination with her dead mistress is plain just from the way she handles Rebecca's underclothes. She commands every scene she's in and gives the most memorable performance of everyone. (I do wish she and Sanders had more screentime together though; I just love their verbal sparring and mutual loathing.)Overall, this is a good, old-fashioned ghost story. Hitchcock would make movies closer to his interests in the years to come, but REBECCA is no slouch and a fine beginning for his Hollywood career.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "A triumph of gothic filmmaking", "date": "2020-03-23T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5572717", "sentiment score": [0.003, 0.0234, 0.2119, 0.669, 0.0927]}, {"content": "Not always the title of a novel, or a movie, has to do with the main issue that is treated in the novel, or on the movie.

Perhaps his most enchanting leading lady was Joan Fontaine, who won an Oscar for her role in Suspicion (1941), but who was never more appealing than in her first film for Hitch, Rebecca, based on a novel by Daphne Du Maurier.The gorgeous Fontaine plays a meek young woman (we never discover her name, but she's not the 'Rebecca' of the title) who falls for rich aristocrat 'Maxim' de Winter (Laurence Olivier) while working in the South of France. Equally besotted, Maxim proposes to the self-effacing beauty, and takes her back to his ancestral home, Manderley, which he once shared with his first wife Rebecca, before she drowned in a boating accident. The new Mrs. de Winter does her best to adapt to her new lifestyle, but is constantly under the shadow of her predecessor, with stern housekeeper Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) being particularly disapproving of Maxim's new bride, deliberately driving a wedge between the married couple and even going so far as to try and talk Mrs. de Winter Mk. II into killing herself.Thus far, the film is pure melodrama and sappy romance, and avid Hitchcock fans might be wondering where the murder and mystery is; worry, not, for this comes in the second half of the film and provides plenty of intrigue and suspense as Maxim reveals what really happened to his first wife and is subsequently suspected of her murder. Both his wife and the viewer are aware of his innocence, but with Rebecca's lover Jack Favell (George Sanders) accusing Mr. de Winter of murder, and plenty of damning evidence, things are looking pretty bad for the poor fellow. It all wraps up nicely in the end, of course, but there are plenty of tense moments along the way, all handled in the director's typically assured manner, with bags of atmosphere and sumptuous cinematography.But as great as the direction and story are, it is the performances that really make Rebecca a winner: Olivier is perfect as the troubled toff, Anderson is wonderfully wicked as scheming housekeeper Danvers, nobody does 'bumbling oaf' quite as well as Nigel Bruce (playing Major Giles Lacy, who puts his foot in his mouth whenever he speaks), Sanders is suitably slimy as adulterous blackmailer Favell, and Fontaine... well, she is completely captivating, every smile, every tilt of her head, and every nervous glance guaranteed to win over the viewer (she was nominated for Best Actress in a Leading Role at the Oscars, but lost to Ginger Rogers).

The story revolves around a young woman who meets Maxim De Winter and soon becomes his second wife. Later, he takes her to her place named Manderley where she learns a dark secret to his first wife. Rebecca is a twisted fairytale. At the beginning of the film we are introduced to Joan Fontaine who is a shy and insecure woman looking for love. She later meets Maxim De Winter who acts as her prince charming even though he is cruel towards her and she tries everything to escape her evil godmother and eventually the two fall in love and get married. She has this fantasy that he will to her to his palace called Manderley and live happily ever after, but it is far from happy. She is Snow White who wakes up from her coma with the imagination that she will live happily ever after with her prince charming, but once she sees Manderley up close her fairytale is an illusion. Mrs. Danvers is the Queen in the Snow White story who is the scariest woman in movie history. Mrs. Danvers loved the first Mrs. De Winter almost as she were the first wife before the second Mrs. De Winter took her place. All the other characters that we meet along the way are part of the second Mrs. De Winter's fairytale illusion. She's still wants that fairytale to be real and it's the only one living in that fantasy while everyone else is oblivious of the fact that they are also part of the story, but they don't realize it. By this point there is no hope for her as she refuses to be woken up from her dream as she believes that dreams can come true while the first wife was cruel to Maxim. Maxim at once believed that dreams do come true, but once he found out about her real intentions he woke up and realized that his dream was shattered. Alfred Hitchcock takes the beloved fairytale that we all know and turns it upside down and gives it a more gothic tone. Overall, this love story shows us that love is cruel and harsh even though we don't want to accept it.

Maxim, the wonderful Olivier, is unpredictable. You are never quite sure if he charming or sinister. Hitchcock directs with flair and whips up a delightful slice of Gothic horror. Or maybe it is romance, But then you find out Rebecca liked sex.Well, not quite liked that but a ton heat goes out of the film after the reveal about Rebecca's death happens. Admittedly, the reveal scene is extremely gripping and it is masterful the way Hitchcock makes you perceive without seeing Rebecca. And it works thematically as well as the film is discussing the notion of identity. Nonetheless, there isn't much there (in terms of drama) after that point.

However, I can say the same thing about \"Casablanca\", for example. This section begins with the startling revelation by Maxim de Winter(Laurence Olivier), that he detested, rather than cherished, his deceased wife: Rebecca. His young replacement wife('no name')(Joan Fontaine) had been in aw of Rebecca, as everyone praised her whit, energy, and skill as the mistress of an English manor. It's very odd that Maxim was so late telling his new wife that he hated his former wife, for several reasons. He said she was incapable of real love. She continued with her promiscuous lifestyle after they were married, although she managed to mostly hide this. She taunted him with details of her affairs and the suggestion that she was pregnant by another man. 'No name' was elated that Maxim, apparently in contrast to everyone else she had met at Manderley, despised his former wife, giving her an opening to outshine Rebecca, at least in Maxim's mind.(Incidentally, it's Manderley, not Mandalay, as a few reviewers wrote. Mandalay is a city in Myanmar(Burma)). Even a year after her death, there were still many physical reminders of Rebecca in the manor, often labeled with 'R'. Her room remained as it was when she died. Probably, this was more the policy of the head servant: Mrs. Danvers((Judith Anderson) than of Maxim. She had an extraordinary fondness for Rebecca, and often reminded 'no name' of her inferiority. At one point, Mrs. Danvers asks 'no name' why she doesn't leave, since Maxim doesn't love her. She opens the window, and suggests 'no name' may want to jump out. It's curious why 'no name' didn't fire her at this point?! It demonstrates how much Mrs. Danvers hated either 'no name' or Maxim or both. Also, during the burning of Manderley, Mrs. Danvers told 'no name' that she started the fire because she couldn't stand to see them as a happy couple in Manderley. Again, it's unclear whether her anger is directed at just one of them or both. Clearly, Rebecca hated Maxim, as he hated her, and tried to goad him into killing her, when she wanted to die because of her advanced uterine cancer. That way, presumably, she could ruin Maxim while accomplishing her goal of dying quickly. Did Rebecca and Mrs. Danvers have a common reason for hating Maxim? If so what was it? Could it be that they both hated men? Could they have had a lesbian relationship? The Production Code wouldn't allow clear evidence for a positive answer. Note that in burning the Manderley, Mrs. Danvers destroys all the remaining physical reminders of Rebecca, as well as herself. This was a suicidal act as well as an act against the de Winters. I see practical problems with the whole business of Maxim staging an accidental drowning of Rebecca to cover up her dying from a fall on her head during their tussle. First, why did he go to this trouble? He could have reported the truth that her death was accidental. He didn't think anyone would believe him, but I don't see why not. Rebecca's body was said to be found inside the cabin of the scuttled boat. But this was a year after she disappeared and nearly as long since he had supposedly identified her body some distance from the Manderley. Her body should have completely decomposed by then. Small Flesh-eating animals could get through the holes opened in the boat bottom to sink it. Thus, identification would probably have to be through dental records. The question of how those boat bottom valves got open is also a sticky point. She could have opened them, but why go to the trouble of drowning herself that way. Also, a letter from her on that fateful day gave no hint that she felt suicidal. However, her recent report from her doctor of an advanced cancer gave a possible motive for suicide.Why is Joan Fontaine's character nameless other than the 2nd Mrs. de Winter? She probably has more screen time than anyone else.

Closely based on the novel by Daphne du Maurier, the film follows the romance and subsequent marriage between an unworldly young woman and Mr. Maxim de Winter, a wealthy widower and owner of the lavish estate Manderley. From its famous opening line, \"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again\u0085\" the film transports us into a dream-like world where fears of unworthiness and incompetence predominate, and the specter of Maxim's first wife, Rebecca, reproaches the young Mrs. De Winter at every turn.The casting in 'Rebecca' is impeccable. Joan Fontaine plays the wallflower wife (nameless in both the film and the novel) of Maxim de Winter. Fontaine brings to the role the perfect blend of hand wringing, stutters and stumbling around, while managing to look absolutely lovely doing it. Her performance is beautifully understated and full of sincerity and quiet charm. Lawrence Oliver was the obvious choice to play the moody and unpredictable Maxim given his earlier (and equally excellent) portrayal of Heathcliff in William Wyler's 1939 adaptation of 'Wurthering Heights'. However, it is Judith Anderson's haunting presence in the role of Manderley's housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, that really steals the show. Anderson captures the nuances of this conflicted, complex woman who is often a stronger and more compelling character than Mrs. De Winter, the dreamy heroine. The scene in which Mrs. Danvers gives Mrs. De Winter a tour of Rebecca's former bedroom is among the most powerful in the film.'Rebecca' is beautifully scripted throughout, drawing heavily on du Maurier's original text. One key difference between novel and film, however, is that Maxim's culpability in Rebecca's death is largely mitigated in the film version, while in the novel he explicitly confesses to intentional murder. One can debate the merits of this choice - it certainly brings the film to a more conventional resolution, where Maxim is permitted to assume a semi-heroic role and the demands of moral conduct are satisfied. But this comes at the expense of du Maurier's original intention, which would have allowed a moral ambiguity to cloud the interpretation of the characters of Maxim and, especially, Rebecca.Ultimately, 'Rebecca' is among the most lovely and elegant pictures ever made.

What is with that Manderley that inspired that dream anyway? The answer is of course in the title, it's all about \"Rebecca\". In fact, there's not a single element that belongs to the film or to the original novel written by Daphne du Maurier and that can be defined with the economy of that name-calling. Manderley was the place Rebecca lived. Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier) is Rebecca's widower. Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) is her former governess. And Joan Fontaine suffers from the most ungrateful status as she's not even given a first name, she's only known as the \"second Mrs. De Winter\" she's not even Rebecca's rival because it's a lost fight, mentioning her in the same breath than Rebecca is like pronouncing the name of God in vain.So, the whole movie is overshadowed by Rebecca's aura, it's like the black-and-white photography, drawn through powerful contrasts, was just some decoy containing the shadowy presence of Rebecca, likely to commit an intrusion at any time, by means of a memory, an evocation, a revelation or a confession. There's a moment where Fontaine asks Maxim's best friend (Reginald Denny) about Rebecca, all he can say is that she was the most beautiful creature he ever saw. It takes some superhuman talent to convince us that Fontaine's not as beautiful as Rebecca, however she looked. As the shy, hapless and desperate-to-please Mrs. De Winters, Fontaine is vital to the credibility of the story because through her behavior, she's the plain that gives prominence to the mountain.And 'plain' is the word, it is the mark of a very subtle talent to take distance from the usual strong-minded, glamorous and independent heroines played by the likes of Bette Davis and Katherine Hepburn and create such a fragile, delicate and mild-mannered woman, begging for friendship rather than love, in awe of her husband and in total fear from Mrs. Danvers, the ominous governess who never misses an opportunity to remind what kind of a woman Rebecca was. It's a real psychological torture-game operating on Mrs. De Winter's head and frail shoulders and she hardly finds comfort in Maxim who seems to be constantly preoccupied and absent. Olivier seems rather uncomfortable in the role, but while the story unfolds, we slowly understand the reason of his emotional nonchalance and the no-less odd attraction to his new wife. Of course, even the answers belong to Rebecca.Daphne du Maurier was a woman who enjoyed isolation, not just for work but also as a way to contemplate her freedom and question her identity. This distance from the world predisposed her for fascination, for the ability, as a 'first person' to be haunted by someone, and it often happened to be a woman, or her memory, sometimes even a vague idea was enough. Through her fertile imagination and ambiguous sexuality, she managed to translate this power into a splendid Gothic-tale whose risqu\u00e9 subjects forced Hitchcock to make a few changes. But he faithfully, albeit at times not too subtly, respected the original material and his camera-work conveyed the ghostly presence of Rebecca. Even Danvers who seemed to have had a privileged relationship (of platonic nature in the film) seems to glide over the place, as if she was possessed by the soul of her deceased mistress.Hitchcock was a craftsman and his camera loved the faces of Anderson and Fontaine, the cinematography also accentuates the feeling of an impending danger, and the acting was enriched by the presence of a youngish George Sanders and Leo G. Carroll who would also reveal one thing or two about good old Rebecca. It was Hitchcock's first Hollywood movie and needless to say the trial was conclusive. The film won the Oscar for Best Picture, over classics like \"The Grapes of Wrath\" and \"The Great Dictator\", without winning any of the major awards in the directing, acting and writing department, but I guess that's what can be said about \"Rebecca\", it is a great picture with the looks, the mystery, the acting and everything one could ask for.I only wish it didn't overplay the melodramatic violins and a succession of twists and revelation at the end satisfy the mind, but don't fool us either as Olivier didn't play the kind of roles that deserved a happy ending by Hitch' standards. The film redeems itself with some last-minute thrills but Hitchcock would make subtler films. Still, \"Rebecca\" holds up well today because there's that uniqueness in the heroine and this extraordinary presence, the fascination over the fact that the most fascinating character is actually absent. The American Film Institute recognized Mrs. Danvers as the thirty-first villain of all time, but I wonder if Rebecca on her own way was the real antagonist and would have deserved that title a little more. Indeed, we never see her, but we can feel her actions, just like the Man in \"Bambi\" who also nominated in the same list, an invisible but an undeniably evil presence.Now, does Rebecca win or lose as an antagonist? Well, from the opening line, the one about that dream, one can guess that you can never totally get rid of Rebecca, and maybe for that reason, despite the film's flaws and that it's never mentioned at along with \"Vertigo\", \"Psycho\", \"North by Northwest\" or \"Rear Window\" as Hitch' best, we can never totally ignore \"Rebecca\".", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 4}, "heading": "Rebecca, Larger-than-Life, Larger-than-Death...", "date": "2017-03-02T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3651356", "sentiment score": [0.0544, 0.156, 0.2363, 0.3942, 0.1592]}, {"content": "This is another example of Hitchcock's hatred for women.

Quite frankly, I'm amazed at how well Hitchcock \"got\" what American audiences wanted in their suspense films, hitting them out of the park from the moment he began working in the US. Apart from being a tad bit long, this is a well made film. I love the inside of Mandalay and Sir Laurence Olivier played a wonderful mysterious and sullen Maximillian De Winter opposite his new wife, a beautiful and naive young Joan Fontaine who is never even given a name here, probably deliberately and in keeping with how mousy and \"second hand\" she feels about herself in relation to the first and late Mrs. De Winter, who is actually Rebecca from the title.Of course there is also George Sanders, playing the type of character he is best known for--sarcastic, snobby, self-assured, pompous, witty and verbose. He hits the nail on the head as Rebecca's \"cousin\" - so he calls himself. Of course the most eerie and unsettling character was Mrs. Danvers, Rebecca's housekeeper or \"maid in waiting.\" Danvers takes great pains in sabotaging the second Mrs. De Winter's marital relationship with Max de Winter,--even going as far as calmly urging her to to plunge to her death into the water from Rebecca's bedroom window at Mandalay. There are a couple of twists in this movie, but I won't give them away. It's best if you watch them unfold yourself in true Hitchcockian style.I will say that Rebecca, the first wife of Max de Winter, is NEVER seen, but we learn about her by what is said about her by the various characters, even going as far as seeing the untouched shrine of a bedroom maintained by Mrs. Danvers. But soon you learn that Rebecca was never the perfect wife Danvers and others make her out to be. The ending is a surprise in more way than one, and yet Mrs. Danvers gets the last word in her own way. A great movie by Alfred Hitchcock and David O.

It was the only of Hitch's films to win an Academy Award, winning Best Picture in 1940. However, much like North by Northwest, another fan favorite, I don't care for Rebecca. Almost everything that makes a film Hitchcock-esque seems to be missing in Rebecca. The film is full of imposing camera angles and the wonderful lighting I adore in Hitchcock pictures, but his standard care with which his narrative is formed seemed completely different. Starring Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine, Rebecca tells the story of a recently married couple and the self-consciousness experienced by the new bride who cannot seem to escape the shadow of her new husband's deceased first wife. 'Maxim' de Winter (Laurence Olivier) a wealthy man living in a sprawling estate meets a quiet, timid young woman who he instantly falls in love with and decides to marry. The new Mrs. De Winter (Joan Fontaine) soon learns that there is a spirit hanging over her new home, that spirit belongs to the first wife of her new husband, Rebecca. Mrs. de Winter soon becomes fully aware just how much Rebecca's memory has engulfed her husband's thoughts. There are even rooms in her home that haven't been changed since Rebecca was there. Mrs. de Winter clashes with the staff in the home, as it seems everyone is longing for the first Mrs. de Winter.Rebecca seems less like a Hitchcock film than the sole comedy he made Mr. & Mrs. Smith. The audience wasn't thrown into the suspense like in Strangers on a Train, the tone wasn't set like it was in Psycho, it was a diligent narrative that seemed more like a John Ford film than a Hitchcock picture.

Nevertheless she is talked up as the absolute paragon of womanhood and femininity; mature, sophisticated, the most beautiful creature you could ever lay your eyes on. Joan Fontaine plays the opposite quite well - the naive, tittering little girl who could never compare to the first Mrs de Winter (at least in the eyes of Mrs Danvers), and yet Maxim seems to fall for him anyway. In a funny way, the twist does make sense; most of the resentment is from Mrs Danvers herself, eyeing needles her way as she dons what Rebecca made stunning and keeps her former bedroom in pristine condition, like an obsessive shrine. Hitchcock begins with an eerie statement; the ghost dominating a dream where she returns to the fated Manderley and drifts right through the gates (a clever trick with the camera) as though nothing will stop her from seeing that no woman ever replaces herself. Later the happily married couple mimic the same entrance through the gates and up the driveway, in pouring rain (never a good omen), although the soundtrack is stirringly romantic and attempting to convince us that all is well. Beneath the ground level class and sheen Hitchcock utilises the great Gothic archways and ominous shadows well. Through the soundtrack, a pair of double doors seem to almost speak directly to Fontaine, enticing her to unveil their secret. She is blonde, of course, and wears white, whilst the housekeeper is robed in pure black and has a face that is constructed from ivory, still, unmoving and emotionless. She is like Nosferatu the vampire himself. Unfortunately what the twist does, effectively, is render this all rather fruitless. Initially the entire atmosphere of the troubled Manderley estate is fraught with second guessing on both Fontaine and the audience's part. The visuals, soundtrack and performance all fight to wrest control of the mood; they contradict each other, they try to drown each other out. It's all wonderfully tense because we are alongside Fontaine trying to make sense of the whole affair of Rebecca. But the twist makes it all unironic. Everything becomes played straight - Maxim is just a troubled gentlemen, and the romance becomes sappy and sentimental; see how they make eyes at each other during what should be a pivotal trial scene, and later as Hitchcock holds on their kiss and embrace. Still, it does make for some great moments, chiefly one where Maxim recounts the fateful night with Rebecca. The camera becomes one with his conscience here; it imagines Rebecca on the bed, it rises to meet her eye-level as she gets up, and you can almost visualise her strutting and sneering around the room with a cigarette as the camera swings around. But isn't the former much more frightening? From that moment on, the film loses all of its psychological mystery and appeal, and it is only a matter of time before the happy reconciliation of husband and second wife.

Of all Hitchcock movies I have seen, this one seemed to actively present Director Hitchcock as 'Deus ex machina'. The whole film seemed so contrived and fake; a story should develop 'suis generis' while this one seemed to develop by directorial disposition. In the end, to my way of thinking, it just seemed klunky. And unbelievable. For Hitchcock, the audience has to be conned into believing the events are plausible, the story line is plausible; and for many Hitchcock films, that can be a stretch. For me the worst moment came when Rebecca (Joan Fontaine) dresses as the first Rebecca for a masquerade ball at the suggestion of Mrs. Danvers. Rebecca ended up then, at that point, looking like an idiot; she always seemed not especially bright as a character--and that single decision made her seem downright stupid. Further, an inquest--long after the death of a person--was one more instance of directorial interpolation. And Rebecca, upon hearing that she is, in reality, manipulated into being the 2nd Mrs. Rebecca de Winters, would have acted appropriately in demanding answers from her new spouse; instead, she turns to Mrs. Danvers, who is intended to look and be something of psycho-zombie for confirmation of details. Again, turning to the demonic Mrs. Danvers makes Rebecca (Joan Fontaine) look borderline idiotic, especially given that Rebecca is portrayed in the film as being terrified of this psycho-zombie.To me, in the end, the movie just didn't work. I gave it 10 stars--because either way it is great as a horrible movie or horrible as a great movie; an exercise and insight into how not to make movies, especially from a Director who mastered this genre with such brilliance by making the barely plausible--seem possible.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "A great HORRIBLE movie or a HORRIBLE great movie!", "date": "2016-03-13T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3431026", "sentiment score": [0.2143, 0.5697, 0.1658, 0.0427, 0.0074]}, {"content": "I don't have much to add to the overwhelmingly positive response to this film expressed on this site and elsewhere.

She is met with bizarre reception from his friends, as well as his mysterious housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) and finds herself haunted by the ceaseless memory of his first wife who died in a bizarre accident outside the property.Probably Alfred Hitchcock's most Gothic work, \"Rebecca\" is a phenomenal and faithful adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's classic novel; the film itself has deservedly earned its place in the film canon, much as the source novel has in the literary realm. The plain truth is that \"Rebecca\" is an all-around masterwork. It's easy to forget that this is a Hitchcock film, which is maybe what makes it such an interesting piece of his filmography\u2014 while the film has Hitchcockian colorings, it is quite possibly the least \"Hitchcockian\" of all his films, leaning more as an ode to Gothicism than any of Hitch's signature quirks.Predating the aesthetics of Jack Clayton's \"The Innocents\", Robert Wise's \"The Haunting\", and Lewis Allen's \"The Uninvited\", \"Rebecca\" is the paramount of spooky mansion films, which is interesting because it really isn't a spooky mansion film at all (yet another paradox). It is not at all a ghost film, though the presence of the eponymous Rebecca haunts every frame just as much as the memory of her torments the leading lady. Fontaine's character is reminded of, compared to, and prodded with the memory of Rebecca at every turn, and the film's shadowy photography of the expansive manor's interiors provide a landscape in which the omnipresent former wife can possibly lurk. Ominous and portentous warnings from the bizarre housekeeper only accentuate the feeling that Rebecca may be lurking in any corner, be it in human or spirit form. As a partial result, the terror that is central to the film is very much psychological; if anything, I'd categorize the film as a psychological thriller, though the thrills are fairly light, especially by today's standards. Tour-de-force performances from Joan Fontaine and Laurence Olivier especially boost the overall impact, with Fontaine believably embodying a woman who finds herself in a new life that is haunted by her predecessor, and Olivier is quietly menacing yet charming and suave. Judith Anderson's legendary performance as the cryptic Mrs. Danvers is also key here, adding a necessary unnerving sensibility as she invokes Rebecca more forthrightly and disturbingly than any other character. Unlike so many films of the era, the performance here are truly timeless.I would say that this is one of Hitchcock's greatest films, but the truth is that it's just a great film, period. It is dissimilar in tone from what the director is most celebrated for, and for that reason is easily separated from his stylistics, though very much an important hallmark in his career. \"Rebecca\" is an understated masterpiece of Gothic horror that looms over the genre just as ubiquitously as our titular invisible monster. 10/10.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 5}, "heading": "The other woman", "date": "2015-05-22T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3242931", "sentiment score": [0.0074, 0.0587, 0.2933, 0.5759, 0.0646]}, {"content": "Joan Fontaine as Mrs.De Winters & Judith Anderson as Mrs.Danvers in the film Rebecca (1940 film) by the great Alfred Hitchcock, are two of the most cinematic characters I have ever seen!

I won't waste space repeating all of the praise that's already been expressed by so many reviewers about the wonderful acting, directing, musical score, etc. I would like to comment, however, on the performance of one actress who never seems to get much credit. It's Florence Bates, who plays the rather short but important part of Mrs. Van Hopper at the beginning of the film. I don't think her performance as the rich, rude, self-centered American traveler abroad could possibly have been more perfect. She interrupts and rudely scolds her paid companion (Joan Fontaine), she pushes herself on Max DeWinter in efforts to scrape an acquaintance with him because of his wealth, she's totally repulsive and she speaks English in the uppity- rich Boston/Philadephia manner. She is rude and insulting at all times.Now here are some amazing facts about Florence Bates. Born in 1888, she grew up in Texas, was from a Jewish family, and was a talented piano student but a hand injury forced her to give up piano. She was a brilliant student and earned a university mathematics degree; taught math in high school briefly, then studied law and became the first woman licensed to practice law in Texas. She was fluent in Spanish and, after radio was introduced around 1920 she had her own Spanish-language radio program in Texas with the goal of improving relations between Americans and Mexicans. She later ran her father's antique shop, and when her husband lost his fortune in the 1929 crash the couple moved to California and operated a bakery. In California she acted in a few plays and finally in 1939 she landed her very first film role--in Rebecca! She ran into Alfred Hitchcock by accident and he knew she would be perfect for the part and offered it to her--her very first film role.Clearly a person of immense energy and multiple talents, she was 51 years old when she made this \"film debut\" (Rebecca was actually filmed during 1939 but not released till 1940.)As to her acting in Rebecca, the way she uses her voice, facial expressions and general posture and demeanor to create and project the personality of this relatively minor character is, in my opinion, nothing short of genius. If you have a DVD copy of the film, have another look at her brief performance (she is only present in the first half hour of the film.) Watch especially the scene at Max DeWinter's hotel room door as he announces to her that he has become engaged to her \"companion.\" And watch the movements of the camera as it anticipates her glance toward the companion after DeWinter's hand gesture. I agree with reviewers who suggest that Hitchcock should have won \"Best Director\" because just this scene alone should have won the award for him, in my opinion.As to Hitchcock's use of the camera, I think it's wonderful the way he has the camera OFF the face of the person speaking and, instead, ON the face of the person being spoken to. Example: the early scene in which Mrs. Van Hopper announces the engagement of her daughter and her sudden decision to sail for New York. We only see the back of her head as she speaks--allowing us to focus on the full facial reaction of Joan Fontaine to this awful news.These are just a couple of the touches of genius in acting and directing that I appreciate in this wonderful movie.

I looked at the clock, and the discovery of the boat and the other body does not happen until the 80 minute mark. Most motion pictures are winding down at 80 or 90 minutes-- but in this case, the film is just reaching its turning point. The last half-hour, when we have Favell's blackmail scheme and where we find out whether or not Rebecca was pregnant is truly the most compelling, plot- driven portion of the movie. Then the ending with Danvers going mad is the most dramatic, climactic part. This film could easily have been trimmed by thirty or forty minutes and it would have been just as good. What we have in this form, is producer David Selznick forcing Hitchcock to aid him in indulging in continuous atmosphere and a padded story that is meant to be big and shout masterpiece. It is definitely a masterpiece, but it could have been streamlined in parts and been a lot more compact without compromising any of its value.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 3}, "heading": "Last night I dreamt of a shorter film", "date": "2014-12-23T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3147059", "sentiment score": [0.03, 0.2805, 0.4628, 0.2036, 0.0231]}, {"content": "Joan Fontaine (Mrs de Winter) is a companion to the very snobby and highly amusing Florence Bates (Mrs Van Hopper).

This movie is so impressive because of how early he made it. This was one of his first major hits, and one of his best. While I still prefer Dial M for Murder and Rear Window as his best Mystery films, this one doesn't disappoint.Hitchcock, like several other great directors is always good at creating memorable characters, and this one has plenty. Particularly the housekeeper Mrs. Danvers. I think she is the character that I will remember for years to come and I'm glad she got an Oscar nomination that year. Another thing Hitchcock is known for is the twists and turns that the story and its characters take. There is always at least one big secret hidden away in the story. Secrets that us as viewers seemingly believe our characters have no way out of, but somehow someway the story comes back around and changes our minds. Major props to the writing crew, though its based on a book, the writers did a great job making this story our own and not giving anything away until its revealed but also leaving enough clues to where the second viewing becomes that much cooler.My only complaint would have been the length of the film, it dragged at times which lessened my hype for the ending. But it didn't make the final product as surprising as it was. But I will say the man guarding the shed definitely made me suspect that there was something not being told to us.

A superb adaptation of Daphne du Maurier's best selling novel, \"Rebecca\" was Alfred Hitchcock's first American directorial assignment, although producer David O. Selznick's strong influence is evident. While lacking the color and historical spectacle of \"Gone with the Wind,\" Selznick's follow-up to his 1939 blockbuster shares lush production values, a thickly romantic atmosphere, and flawless performances with its illustrious predecessor. Both classics were adapted from popular novels, and both won Academy Awards for Best Picture.Du Maurier's well known mystery centers on a never-seen, but exquisitely beautiful and admired woman, Rebecca, who dies tragically before the story begins; however, she casts a dark shadow over her husband, his young second wife, and Manderlay, a stately seaside estate in Cornwall. The mystery-romance unfolds before George Barnes's Oscar-winning camera work, which emphasizes velvety blacks, window-cast shadows, and rainy reflections on a grandfather clock. Franz Waxman's lush score weaves its own web throughout the film with an appropriate mix of romantic themes and suspense.In front of the camera, Hitchcock drew memorable performances throughout. Sporting a mustache and a touch of grey, Laurence Olivier embodies the handsome Cornish aristocrat, Maxim de Winter; smooth, cultured, refined, and harboring a dark secret. With a voice born for sarcasm, George Sanders steals his scenes in a snide, cunning performance as Rebecca's \"favorite\" cousin. Mrs. Danvers ranks among cinema's most beloved villains, and Judith Anderson is cold, impassive, and riveting. Also called \"Danny\" in a sly allusion to her lesbian infatuation with the title character, Anderson excels in a restrained, yet hypnotic scene, where she fondles Rebecca's furs and caresses her lingerie; the actress says everything that the Production Code forbade about Danver's relationship with Rebecca. Florence Bates is another scene stealer as Mrs. Van Hopper, Joan Fontaine's employer; selfish, self absorbed, catty, and unforgettable. In support, Selznick sprinkled in such veterans as Gladys Cooper, Nigel Bruce, Reginald Denny, C. Aubrey Smith, and Leo G. Carroll to fill out an exceptional cast.Although easily overlooked among the bounty of rich performances and skilled thespians, Joan Fontaine's portrayal of the second Mrs. de Winter is exquisite throughout. Still in her early 20's, Fontaine's subtle growth from shy insecure travel companion, dominated by her overbearing employer, to self-assured supportive wife is masterful and never calls attention to itself; on a subsequent viewing, fans should focus on Fontaine throughout and marvel. While Fontaine grows as a woman, she also becomes closer to Olivier as the story unfolds; initially, Olivier kisses her chastely on the forehead, retains a distance between them, but, as the secrets spill, Olivier reaches out to her and, eventually, they kiss on the lips.Hitchcock's final image in \"Rebecca\" foreshadows that in \"Citizen Kane.\" A silk pillow embroidered with an \"R\" is consumed by flames; a year later, Orson Welles ended his masterwork with a sled emblazoned \"Rosebud\" also engulfed in flames. Like the Welles classic, \"Rebecca\" is a timeless film that bears repetition.

As a rule I don't have favorite films (because I can never pick) but let's be real, it's probably this one. I've seen Rebecca a good 10+ times and it never gets old. I feel obligated to talk about the book just a little (it's amazing read it), because there is a big difference. First of all, I'm so thankful that the nameless main character in the novel remains nameless in the film. The book is slightly more twisted, as Maxim intentionally kills Rebecca in the novel, which makes for a much more complex and slightly more intense plot. This obviously could not be carried out in a 1940s film, however. Although I wish they had.I really love the characters in this film. They make the whole story, and the idea of Rebecca is so strong it's like she's there as a fully formed character. Mrs. Danvers is the quintessential eerie housekeeper (who a lot of later figures are based off of), and her scenes with Mrs. de Winter are some of the best.

I killed that when I told you about Rebecca. It's gone. In a few hours, you've grown so much older\". The despondency, regret and sense of loss that are embodied in these words are incredibly profound and typify the general atmosphere of gloom and melancholy that's such a strong and important feature of this extraordinary film.During a short stay in Monte Carlo, a na\u00efve young lady who works as a paid companion for a rich overbearing society woman meets and falls in love with an older aristocratic Englishman called Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier). Their relationship develops rapidly and soon the young lady becomes \"the second Mrs de Winter\" (Joan Fontaine) and returns with her new husband to his enormous estate in Cornwall and his huge mansion called \"Manderley\".Maxim is a moody widower whose first wife, Rebecca, died in a boating accident. He's often brusque with his wife and she assumes that his sudden outbursts of anger are linked to his inability to come to terms with the loss of Rebecca. When she becomes the new mistress of Manderley, the second Mrs de Winter is soon overwhelmed by her new role and starts to feel rather isolated because of the aloofness of her staff and her husband's rather distant manner. She's also surprised and intimidated by the degree to which the spectre of Rebecca seems to be ever-present as everyone in the mansion (including Maxim) seems obsessed with Rebecca.Mrs Danvers (Judith Anderson) is the cold, severe looking housekeeper who \"adored\" Rebecca and now keeps her room exactly as it was when her previous mistress was alive. Her hostility to the second Mrs de Winter is obvious from their first meeting and she does everything within her power to undermine her new mistress including trying to get her to commit suicide. The feelings of fear, inadequacy and powerlessness that the second Mrs de Winter experiences at this point are intense but soon everything changes when a sunken boat is discovered nearby with a body inside it. A whole series of revelations then follow and make it clear that so many things at Manderley were not as they had originally appeared to be.Laurence Olivier's performance as a tormented man who's haunted by his past is very good but definitely outshone by Joan Fontaine and Judith Anderson. Fontaine's expressions and body language convey her character's timidity, uncertainty and sincerity with enormous power and Judith Anderson is convincingly evil as one of movie history's most memorable villains.An interesting feature of \"Rebecca\" is the techniques that are used to make the second Mrs de Winter appear insignificant and inferior. Not only does she get cruelly dominated by her employer in Monte Carlo and consistently patronised by Maxim but she's also denied even the basic dignity of having a name. When she's first introduced to the staff at Manderley, she's made to feel uncomfortable and embarrassed because she's rain-soaked and dishevelled and visually, the distorted dimensions of the interiors of Manderley make her look physically smaller, lost and out of her depth in her impressive new surroundings.Although Alfred Hitchcock famously dismissed \"Rebecca\" as not being a \"Hitchcock film\", it's an exceptionally good film that's very well directed with numerous touches that are characteristic of the great director's work.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 4, "votes": 7}, "heading": "Romance, Fear & Dark Secrets", "date": "2014-03-21T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2983399", "sentiment score": [0.0037, 0.0134, 0.0706, 0.5698, 0.3426]}, {"content": "\"You thought you could be Mrs. de Winter, live in her house, walk in her steps, take the things that were hers! But she's too strong for you.

I still have a lot of Hitchcock films to catch up with, but so far I haven't seen one I disliked. Rebecca is a near masterpiece and Hitchcock once again proves his craft as a director by slowly building a psychological romantic thriller and then once we are hooked with the characters he pulls the rug under our feet and delivers some surprising twists we never expected. This may not be one of Hitchcock's most popular films, but it will always be regarded for being the only film of his that won him an Oscar. Rebecca isn't his best film (which in my opinion is Rear Window), but it deserves to be ranked amongst his best work thanks to a gripping screenplay, some wonderful performances, memorable characters, and above all its beautiful black and white cinematography. It is simply stunning and despite being made in 1940 it still manages to remain incredibly suspenseful and unique. Despite knowing that Hitchcock is going to come up with an interesting twist he completely catches me off guard every time and leaves me even more engaged with his work. My only complaint (a minor one) with his films is that despite being subtle throughout the story at the end he spells everything out for the audience trying to explain the twists (Psycho is the best example of this, but in Rebecca it's done again and it makes the film drag a bit near the end, but it's only a minor complaint considering we are talking about the Master of Suspense). Rebecca is based on Daphne Du Maurier's celebrated novel (who also wrote The Birds which Hitchcock later went on to direct) and adapted by Robert E. Sherwood. The story centers on a shy unnamed woman (Joan Fontaine) who works as a paid companion to the wealthy Edythe Van Hooper (Florence Bates). While they are in Monte Carlo she meets a wealthy estate owner named Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier). Edythe mentions that Maxim's wife, Rebecca, passed away an year ago in a boating incident and he hasn't recovered from it. During their short stay in Monte Carlo however, Maxim falls in love with her and the two marry within weeks of having met. Maxim takes the new Mrs. de Winter to his beautiful country home known as Manderley and introduces her to the staff. Despite being in awe of the majestic home, she feels intimidated by the housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson), who remains obsessed with Rebecca. As the days pass, Mrs. de Winter begins to feel overwhelmed by everyone's affection towards Rebecca and somehow she feels that Maxim is still very much in love with her. Rebecca's shadow seems to interfere with everything she does and she begins to feel her relationship is doomed.Rebecca is not simply a psychological thriller centering on relationships, it is a film focusing on identity. Despite never being seen, Rebecca's presence dominates this film and she seems to have a strange effect over everyone. In contrast, the second Mrs. de Winter only gets her name once she marries Maxim and she never really has an identity of her own. She is continually threatened by Rebecca's presence no matter what she does and despite wanting to overcome it she can't because everyone seems to have adored her. Hitchcock builds the tension and suspense very subtly with memorable characters. Despite being extremely beautiful Joan Fontaine pulls off an incredibly natural and believable performance as this shy and insecure pet-girl. Laurence Oliver also plays his role as the loving but distant character very well. However the two most memorable performances for me came from the supporting cast. Judith Anderson and George Sanders play the villains to perfection. Sanders delivers some comedic relief, while Anderson's mysterious and cold face uneases us from the moment she appears on screen. The Gothic mood underlying the film mixes perfectly with the haunting ghost story as Rebecca's presence can be felt everywhere once we step into Manderley.

Selznick. After studying his memos to director Alfred Hitchcock for hours, several things become clear. First, Selznick treated Hitchcock as a total idiot, and bullied him to such an extent that any Miami Dolphins offensive lineman would have quit the team if faced with even half the amount of abuse. Second, Selznick decided that the magic formula for making Americans empty their wallets at the cinema box office was to select a period piece from a female novelist at the top of the best seller list and spare no expense on costumes to put a word-for-word Readers' Digest length \"picturization\" on screen. Fortunately for REBECCA, the censors forced Selznick to accept a change of the key plot point from the book regarding Rebecca's death, which improves the story's believability by at least 400%. An equally important break for this picture is that Hitchcock's one-camera, one-take shooting style prevented Selznick for totally destroying Hitchcock's work in post. (Perhaps the best proof of the virtual meaninglessness of Hollywood's Good Ol' Boy Oscar voting system is that Selznick--NOT Hitchcock--got an Oscar for REBECCA; the best picture awards for THE ARTIST & ARGO prove that, if anything, the system has devolved to an even lower nadir today).

Brilliantly directed by Hitchcock who maintains a remarkable control over each frame from start to finish, Rebecca is also aided by its tight screenplay, timeless cinematography, edgy editing & terrific performances from its entire cast.The best part about this tale is the effortless manner in which it is able to immerse the viewers into its tense atmosphere of claustrophobia & isolation with all the mysteries surrounding a dead woman and benefits greatly from strong performances by Joan Fontaine, Laurence Olivier & especially Judith Anderson, who plays Mrs. Danvers with remarkable creepiness & ends up impressing the most.On an overall scale, Rebecca is a significant example of film-noir and is one of Hitchcock's finest works behind the camera.

Nugent calls \"facile and penetrating\" proves that assumption specifically convincing. Though, this is a film which barely resembles the director's hallmarks nor reveals the cream of the Master of Suspense (actually lacking the MacGuffin).The screen adaptation of Daphne Du Marier's story \"stands or falls on the ability of the book's 'I' to escape caricature\" (Frank S. Nugent) but, simultaneously, \"allows Hitchcock to mix styles and genres\" (Berardinelli). His 'visual schemes' and 'thematic concerns' are present here, but the movie belongs to \"somewhat uncharacteristic works\" (R. Berg). It is, actually, REBECCA's Gothic atmosphere and sophisticated characters where its major strengths lie.(Gothic atmosphere) James Berardinelli observes in his review of the movie that \"it is perhaps the height of irony that the only film directed by the Master of Suspense to win a Best Picture Oscar is a Gothic melodrama.\" Just the height of paradox where Hitchock proves to be a versatile director. There is no need to outline the story because each viewer will be led to its mechanisms, its thrill soon after the opening credits are over. Indeed, one could observe that its backbone is partly the novel, partly the resemblance to Bronte's JANE EYRE and partly today's soap opera but the whole decoration that it is covered with brings even skeptical viewers to certain awe. From the start, we see that moonlight can play tricks upon all of us (images heavily influenced by Hitchock's early encounter with German Expressionism at Ufa Studios). That highlights the magnificent job of the cinematographer George Barnes with the haunting use of light and shadow, the atmospheric score by Franz Waxman, the screenplay by Robert Sherwood, Philip Mac Donald, Michael Hogan, Joan Harrison and special effects by Jack Cosgrove. Considering the camera, F.S. Nugent rightly states that \"cameras murmur 'Beware' when a black spaniel raises his head and lowers it between his paws again.\" Among many emblematic scenes of the movie, consider the discovery of Manderlay mansion or the couple's dance in the first phase of the film which is a typical old Hollywood romance. In all these aspects, REBECCA, as one of the most praised productions of the early 1940s, can be considered Hitchock's process of pursuing his style still under the spell of Expressionism but revealing something from the depth of his fertile fantasy.(Characters) Along with the very best performers of the time, F.S. Nugent observes something interesting in that respect. Mr Hitchcock, he says, \"the famous soloist, suddenly recognized that, in this engagement, he is working with an all-star troupe.\" Yes, director's great rapport with the versatile cast results in outstanding performances and displays of great talents. Here, our attention is on Joan Fontaine. And to what extent the artistic side corresponds to the inner worlds of her character is mentioned by Berardinelli who states that \"the director uses camera angles, editing, and music to emphasize the lead character's claustrophobia as it escalates to near hysteria.\" But before I outline certain points about Fontaine's performance, let me highlight another great achievement. It is not merely the great Olivier as the male co-star to Fontaine (one of Hitch's favorite blondes), it is not Sanders in the supporting role of Jack Favell, the scheming member of the extended family. The greatest role belongs to JUDITH ANDERSON as Mrs. Danvers, \"considered by many literary critics to be among the best 20th century villainesses\" (Berardinelli). A haunting character with homo-erotic overtones delivers unique psychological power, displays a Gothic idea of evil disguised by cold manners and indifferent gestures where still waters indeed run deep. In one scene, she introduces Fontaine to the room in the west wing that once belonged to late Rebecca and, magically almost, blends the real world with the imaginary world, spirits and living people, memories with here and now. Adding the narcissistic aspect of inner lusts and her hand placed on Rebecca's clothes delivers bizarre psychedelic experience. She appears to be a shadow incarnate, an incendiary 'persona' of the whole story bringing everything to haunting conclusion.(Fontaine, Olivier) The chemistry between Fontaine and Olivier appears to be striking. The actress who played in some other Hitchock's films being a co-star to Cary Grant in SUSPICION handles the role with sophisticated charm, certain psychological distance, some youthful enthusiasm. Yes, so far together with Larry. Alone, however, her role is hard, very hard as \"a second Mrs. De Winter\" a character placed totally in the shadow of her deceased predecessor, caged within the burden of haunting past ruled by 'the most beautiful creature people ever saw', she has no one to rely on once she enters the mansion and much must be expressed in her facial gestures. Slowly, she explores fears, even psychological angst no less than Bergman in Rossellini's masterpiece. From the inside out, she gives a silent performance to a significant extent. Berardinelli states that she \"emphasizes her inferiority to Rebecca.\" Relying on that notion, we could ask ourselves: what about the superior character to her? All we know is that she was beautiful but incapable of love, some model of 'cold Aphrodite' developed even more intensely in a German film ALRAUNE. 'What was Rebecca really like?' remains a rhetorical question and something that is left to us just to imagine...Maxim De Winter is, to the contrary, a tormented character, a man of good will placed in the wrong place at a wrong time. Quite underrated at certain moments, this is, undeniably, one of Olivier's towering performances.REBECCA is a gem, a highly recommended film which may enhance the Hitchock's reputation as a versatile director and a surprising work where atmosphere and characters still supply us with unique entertainment.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 4, "votes": 7}, "heading": "Gothic Atmosphere and Sophisticated Characters", "date": "2013-08-18T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2852968", "sentiment score": [0.0455, 0.2407, 0.4027, 0.2779, 0.0332]}, {"content": "This movie was an okay movie, but kind of dragged on a bit and became very disappointing to realize that no \"ghost of Rebecca\" is anywhere in the film.

Notice that Mrs. Danvers didn't decide to end it all until after the image of Rebecca was publicly shattered. Otherwise, one full year after the demise of Rebecca, Mrs. Danvers was still going strong. Thus, the definitive icon for Mrs. Danvers could have been the concept of British Royalty itself; and there are some in England even today who still see things that way.Next, notice that at first, Mrs. Danvers did hope to somehow mold Joan Fontaine into this iconic stature. Moreover, Mrs. Danvers always had to know about Jack Favell and the cottage, and also the rented flat in London; and so it wasn't until, in effect, Jack Favell told \"Danny\" on the telephone about the suddenly destroyed image of Rebecca, reflecting perhaps even against the seemingly nicety nicety image of British Royalty itself, that the end then came for Mrs. Danvers.Continuing, here is more on the role of Mrs. Danvers. One can ask, why did Max de Winter allow Mrs. Danvers to continue maintaining what amounted to the shrine room of Rebecca for a number of months after the passing away of Rebecca, considering what emerged at the end of the movie? One reason could be that Mrs. Danvers the housekeeper did rule the rather large staff of Manderley for some years with a virtual whip, and Max de Winter evidently wasn't in the mood for interviewing for a new one.Even more to the point, Max de Winter obviously didn't want to do anything that might tarnish the image of Rebecca. In other words, no one was to know about his final encounter with Rebecca. Thus, for their respectively different reasons, both Max de Winter and Mrs. Danvers had the same objective of keeping the shrine room intact.Wait, there is still more. At the end, Joan Fontaine tells Max de Winter that Mrs. Danvers didn't want them to be happy at Manderley. However, that was well before the telephone call of Jack Favell, and shortly after Joan Fontaine actually ordered Mrs. Danvers to dismantle the shrine room. Enough said.

This is a very crisp and clear rendition, well worth the update from DVD.I want to begin by giving praise to 2 of the supporting actors here. The standout is Judith Anderson (later Dame Judith Anderson). Without her, this film really wouldn't have worked anywhere near as well. She brought life to one of the most truly spooky characters you'll see in almost any movie. Also deserving of great praise is Florence Bates -- here the stuffy dowager who keeps making a fool of herself. It was Bates' first movie role, and although she is only in the opening scenes of the film, she is quite memorable. However, I prefer her in later roles where a little comedy was woven into a rather steady characterization.If you buy the DVD with the \"making of\" extra, do watch it. It will give you an excellent overview of the struggles that went on between produced David O. Selznick and director Alfred Hitchcock. Mentioned at one point is the question of lesbianism on the part of the character played by Anderson. PERHAPS, but I think the documentary was wrong...that the target was wife # 1, not Joan Fontaine's wife # 2.While this is not my favorite Hitchcock film, it's right up there with such films as \"Suspicion\", \"Shadow Of A Doubt\", and \"Spellbound\". I'll give it ONLY an A, not an A+ that I would give such films as \"North By Northwest\" and \"Vertigo\". However, I think it is so much better a film than \"Wuthering Heights\", which I happened to watch just a few days before viewing this film, again.Laurence Olivier is excellent here. He plays the balance very well between the adoring husband of the new Mrs. de Winter who can't quite break free of the deceased first Mrs. de Winter (or can he?). He also plays a man who is still in turmoil from...from what?However, there is no question that this film belongs to Joan Fontaine. I was not much of a fan of Fontaine, but this film increased my esteem for her a great deal, particularly because she plays against her own type. Watch any old interview with her; she was always ACTING extremely refined; here she is playing a very awkward new wife. It may be her best film...either that or \"Suspicion\". But what is delicious about her performance here is how this beautiful woman manages to make herself seem so very plain for much of this movie. Plain, and yet refreshingly attractive.The other scene-stealer here is George Sanders...but then again, he always was a roguish scene-stealer! You'll also enjoy short performances by Nigel Bruce, Reginald Denny, C. Aubrey Smith, Gladys Cooper, and Leo G. Carroll.I think one of the best scenes in this, or any other film is the sequence when the evil servant helps Fontaine prepare for a costume ball in a costume she knows will remind Olivier of his first wife.The film is a bit over 2 hours, but worth every minute of your time.

That's how good a film it is. Daphne Du Maurier's tale of a shy companion who shocks her employer by winning the most desired wealthy widow in England is gripping, suspenseful, and filled with innuendo. Joan Fontaine never gave a more lovely performance as the awkward bride who leaves her hysterically selfish employer (Florence Bates) to marry the brooding Maxim De Winter (Laurence Olivier) and finds animosity from the darkly dressed Mrs. Danver (Judith Anderson) who resents her intrusion because of her devotion to Maxim's late wife, Rebecca. The mystery of how Rebecca died and what kind of woman she really was is explored, and with the intrusion of scoundrel George Sanders and some well-meaning advice from Maxim's toothy sister (Gladys Cooper), the new Mrs. De Winter (her first name is never revealed) finds out more than she bargained for.If you thought Olivier's Heathcliff in \"Wuthering Heights\" was dark and somewhat depressing, wait until you meet his more civilized Maxim. Joan Fontaine's bride is as far from Merle Oberon's \"wild and sweet\" Cathy as you can find, but as far as Gothic tales of brooding men and their lost souls go, the two movies make a perfect double feature. Samuel Goldwyn and David Selznick were Hollywood's most famous independent producers, so sometimes their careers are compared. They share many of the same players, and in the case of these two films, the same photographer (Gregg Toland). Fontaine and Olivier work well on screen together, even though they apparently did not share a close working relationship. It is, however, the supporting players who are the shining stars. Anderson's Mrs. Danvers is a role we've already seen on screen (usually played by Gale Sondergaard), but being Anderson's second film (and first in 7 years), there was a lot of curiosity surrounding her considering her reputation as one of Broadway's hottest dramatic actresses. Mrs. Danvers isn't a one dimensional evil housekeeper; You understand her affection for the late Rebecca from the very beginning, and in every movement Anderson makes, you cannot take your eyes off of her. I can't praise her highly enough. Sanders' suave villain (who playfully calls Mrs. Danvers \"Danny\") is extremely likable and almost equal in stealing away the attention of the leads. Gladys Cooper and Nigel Bruce add on a delightful \"pip pip\" quality to their eccentric characters, while in her brief time on screen, Florence Bates is hysterically funny, putting out a cigarette in her cold cream, and coolly telling Fontaine how she can never truly be a \"great lady\".Every moment here is a classic movie memory, from the opening narration to Fontaine's first vision of De Winter, and then, the rainy ride down to where Fontaine sees Mandalay for the first time. The light first quarter darkens the moment we see Anderson pop into view as Mrs. Danvers. A cold pause, then \"How Do You Do\" reveals the tension, and from there, everything is set. Anderson explodes in two scenes-the first where she finds the hiding Fontaine in Rebecca's old room, and later, when Fontaine confronts Anderson after discovering her treachery. The film sags just a bit with the discovery of a body that might be Rebecca's, but that is minor. C. Aubrey Smith is memorable in his small role as Maxim's attorney. The final shot will live on in your memory, just as Mandalay lived on in the second Mrs. De Winter's.While \"Rebecca\" won Best Film at that year's Academy Awards, many film historians prefer the message drama \"The Grapes of Wrath\" as the better film. I find the two rank very close, and also quibble over between the choice of Jane Darwell for Supporting Actress over Anderson's Mrs. Danvers. A big mistake was not nominating Sanders. A BBC version years later is also very good, a bit more faithful to the novel, and benefits from Diana Rigg as a more approachable Mrs. Danvers and a very diva-ish performance by Faye Dunaway in the Florence Bates role.

To be frank, that first hour is less than riveting. We find ourselves following the romance and the early part of the marriage of the wealthy and lonely widower Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier) to his new young bride (Joan Fontaine.) There really isn't much meat to this part of the story. It's a bit of a rich meets poor love story, as the young bride finds herself in a romance with this man who was quite above her socially, and it's even got a bit of humour to it, as we watch the young woman's employer Mrs. Van Hopper (Florence Bates) try to ingratiate herself with Maxim. It's a pleasant enough (although not exactly engrossing) love story for a while, and after their return to Maxim's Manderlay estate it still seems to be little more than the challenge of the new Mrs. de Winter (whom I don't remember being named) to overcome the reluctance of the servants - and especially Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) - to accept her, since they appear to have been fiercely devoted to the late Mrs. de Winter (whose name was Rebecca.) Yes, Mrs. Danvers is an unusual, and therefore suspicious, character who has more than a bit of mystery about her, but still this really doesn't seem to be going anywhere very fast.Once we're through that first hour, though, plot twists start to emerge. Maxim starts to pull away from his bride - is he also having trouble accepting her as the new Mrs. de Winter at the estate? Are the differences in the marriage just too much to overcome? Then Rebecca's body is unexpectedly found and questions begin to emerge about how she died. At this point, director Alfred Hitchcock manages to turn what had been a rather empty story into a pretty good suspense/thriller. In that last hour, Hitchcock builds the story brilliantly, so that it gets progressively more suspenseful, and by the time the shocking final scene comes along, as a viewer you're absolutely hooked. It's hard for a movie to overcome such a long stretch at the beginning where little of great note actually happens, but \"Rebecca\" manages to do just that. It's also interesting as an example of a fairly early piece of work by Olivier.

Much has been made about the butting of heads between Alfred Hitchcock and famed Hollywood producer David O. Selznick, but \"Rebecca\" ends up feeling like a Hitchcock picture with the sweeping feel of a Hollywood film.Despite being Hitchcock's first experience working with Hollywood and Selznick's reputation for controlling his projects and making literal book adaptations (this being of Daphne Du Maurier's novel), the best parts of the film have Hitchcock's thumbprint on them. He infuses the story with total suspense and discomfort, refusing to let it bore for long in spite of its length.The story follows a Gothic romance storytelling model akin to the Bronte sisters, which explains why star Joan Fontaine won the lead in \"Jane Eyre\" opposite Orson Welles just a few years later. Hitchcock channels nearly everything through Fontaine's performance as the aptly unnamed main character, a personal assistant who on a whim during her stay in Monte Carlo meets and marries a wealthy widower (Laurence Olivier). Fontaine exudes a lovable naivete, one that starts out earning sympathy but twists into an attribute that antagonizes the audience as the film goes on as the presence of the late great first Mrs. De Winter, Rebecca grows more powerful.The role of Rebecca easily ranks as the most powerful character in cinema to never appear on screen. Hitchcock sees to it that her presence not only fills the mansion that already overwhelms the new Mrs. De Winter, but also consumes the film itself. She's felt both on camera and in the audiences mind, enough so that when Hitchcock pretends that she's really there by \"following her\" with the camera in a key scene late in the film where Maxim recalls the night she died, you honestly believe it and picture her as some terrifying figure. But there's no depreciating the characters on screen. Fontaine as she writhes about in mentally anguish does manifest everything a bit too physically, but the reaction she creates in the audience is a palpable paranoia and fear. Olivier portrays a man quick to anger but clearly for deep-seated reasons that come from a dark place. Then there's Mrs. Danvers, the woman who runs the house. The moment Judith Anderson walks on screen she enters your mind. A good comparison would be Margaret Hamilton as the Wicked Witch in \"The Wizard of Oz.\" It helps that Mrs. Danvers also serves as an antagonist, but in an entirely different way. We connect with our unnamed heroine's fear of Mrs. Danvers, but not simply because she plays the creepy housekeeper, but as we come to know her and understand her connection to the late Rebecca, she becomes this psychologically complex individual. Although Hitchcock's directorial voice runs through Fontaine, Anderson adds punctuation to his efforts, especially as she steals the final moments of the film.Although the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences would have you believe \"Rebecca\" to be Hitchcock's finest effort, it merely showcases his ability as an artist to overcome what was a producer-driven Hollywood at the time. Despite David O. Selznick's name appearing before the title card, Selznick will always be better remembered for \"Gone with the Wind.' \"Rebecca\" \u2014 that was Hitchcock's work.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 4}, "heading": "A Gothic Hollywood romance in the hands of a master", "date": "2011-05-25T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2433878", "sentiment score": [0.0489, 0.4697, 0.309, 0.1492, 0.0232]}, {"content": "This movie is very close to the actual book, written by Daphne du Maurier.

The film today, restored to all its magnificent, pristine clarity, is suitably lush and moody, and after all these years the atmosphere of unease surrounding the stately house of Manderley is still palpable.

Except in \"Rebecca's\" case, it was from the woman's point of view.\"Rebecca\" features identity confusion as well, in this case pitting a woman without a face against another without a name. Joan Fontaine is the nameless one here, paid to keep a miserable battleaxe company until she is whisked away in Monte Carlo by rich, debonair Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier). It's a perfect fantasy except that the place he lives, Manderley, is a perfect nightmare.\"We're happy, aren't we?\" the bride asks at one point. \"Terribly happy!\" The problem's the dead former Mrs. de Winter whose first name is the movie's title. Based on a best-selling novel by Daphne Du Maurier, Rebecca's malign spell is captured in the ornate but shadowy set decoration, a creepy Franz Waxman score, and the raven-like Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson), a maid who pops out of corners of the frame offering unwanted advice on how \"the late Mrs. de Winter\" would have wanted things.Beaky, unblinking Mrs. Danvers is one reason guys might find this film frustrating. If she's so nasty, just send her packing, right? But Mrs. D works for me because of the heroine's trembly manner. Fontaine wears her character's insecurity very well. She wants to be on Mrs. Danvers' good side, which only mines \"Danny's\" contempt. Still devoted to Rebecca, a spellbinding force for whom \"love was a game\", Mrs. Danvers's perverse loyalty prompts a jealous cruelty. In \"The Shining\", we learn that people leave traces of themselves in strange buildings after they're gone, like \"if someone burns toast\". In \"Rebecca\", Mrs. Danvers IS the burned toast.Olivier is a bit of a stiff here, though it suits the part. It's a woman's-eye story all the way, with a real tough-love male to draw out his lover's unquenchable spirit. He wins her over to him with such lines as \"I should have asked you to have had lunch with me even if you hadn't upset the vase so clumsily\" and \"I'm asking you to marry me, you little fool\". He probably sent her out for Chinese food on their honeymoon, too.The movie moves very slowly, stringing out every hurt emotion. Because Rebecca was lost at sea, Fontaine has to blurt out at one point irrespective of nothing: \"I never have any fear of drowning, have you?\" cuing a musical sting. Around Maxim, there are lots of stings. \"I'm boorish through living alone\", he says, but of course that only makes the heroine's devotion more grand. Like Mrs. Danvers, she loves fully, but not at all well.Still, \"Rebecca\" is a solid romantic film with recognizable bits of Hitchcockian suspense worked in the corners. It's his first and most successful collaboration with David O. Selznick (a nudge who this one time was right to nudge), his first American film, and his only Oscar winner.I can think of several other Hitchcock films deserving of Oscar over \"Rebecca\".

I'm talking from Gone with the Wind to Casablanca, 1939 to 1942. Throw in any number of truly staggering movies in the stretch--Citizen Kane for starters--and we have to almost expect Alfred Hitchcock to fit right in. With Rebecca he does. It's another perfect movie.Daphne Du Maurier's book of the same title is a great read, something short of a literary classic but something better than a mere best-seller. I read it recently, and was completely transported into a land of subtle drama. That sounds like an oxymoron, but when you see this movie you'll notice how people act with restraint, with glances, with quiet actions, and yet achieve a grandiose, dramatic effect that tears your heart out. It's an archetypal story about a girl who seems to have a dream come true marrying a charming and very wealthy man.But of course, there are skeletons in this man's closet, and Lawrence Olivier plays the inner struggle of Maxim close to the chest. More openly troubled by events, and so sympathetic your heart jumps out of your chest, is the girl, his wife, played by Joan Fontaine. Now here is a performance that is just incredible. She even changes her presence as her innocence slowly bleeds away from start to finish. If the two of them never quite have sparks fly, they're not supposed to. But Hitchcock has done more than chosen a great, cinematic novel and two amazing actors (as well as a flawless supporting cast). With the most romantic, lush sets, delirious lights, and rich, layered photography, all fluidly combined to create scenes so beautiful you can almost taste it, the director has shown, again, that he understands the intuitive power of the cinema. It isn't the outward brilliance of any one scene or shot, or any one conversation that the camera follows invisibly, or any flinging of the curtains to reveal only more fog or sheer obscurity. It's the pacing and sequence of these moments that sucks you into the world and won't let you go.Well, it's no surprise, maybe, that Rebecca won best picture and best cinematography at the Oscars. And it was up against The Letter, The Grapes of Wrath, and The Philadelphia Story, all of which are more proof that the movies of this period are a zenith of a certain kind of Hollywood. The studio system. (Yes, there are hundreds of other great movies from other years, but I'm not really trying to make my case here.)

Manderley is an enormous castle-like house, first seen in black silhouette in the opening sequence. It lies in ruins.

I have no idea why.\"), REBECCA is undoubtedly one of his timeless classics - the kind of work which has become so embedded in the collective unconscious that certain scenes, lines and characters are mythic, to the point of parody (think of Carol Burnett's riffs on this story in her 1970s comedy show, or Stephen King's use of Mrs. Danvers' image in his \"Bag of Bones\"). This is also one of Hitchcock's great crowd-pleasers - when first released, it played in New York for a year - held over repeatedly due to audience demand - and in England the movie went through the roof, running in London for virtually the length of World War II. It's been playing constantly since then in frequent revivals and television screenings. REBECCA's production was fraught with tension and pain: principal photography started only days before the outbreak of WWII, to the great personal distress of the nearly all-English cast and crew; Hitchcock exploited Joan's Fontaine's inexperience by telling her that she was terrible and everyone hated her so as to deliberately keep her in a near-constant state of defensiveness, fear and anxiety which was 100% appropriate for Fontaine's character; and it soon became quite obvious that Selznick and Hitchcock could not stand one another and would be unable to work together in the long run. The resulting motion picture, however, brought nothing but good fortune to everyone connected with it - Laurence Olivier's long-desired Hollywood career finally took off, Hitchcock's reputation in America was secured, Joan Fontaine became an international star overnight, Selznick won his second Best Picture Oscar in a row and dominated world box-office for another year, and Judith Anderson became an icon, just for starters. This is one of those rare instances where a fantastic book was brought to the screen and made into an equally good film. Miss DuMaurier's plot is legendary: On holiday in the south of France, the untitled Cornish nobleman Max de Winter meets and marries a sweet young girl (Fontaine) whose timely attention perhaps stops him from suicide in one of the best meet-and-greets of all time. Mr. de Winter's subsequent proposal (\"I'm asking you marry me, you little fool.\") rescues the girl from the hell of her life as a paid companion (\"I didn't know companionship could be bought,\" says de Winter) to the Gorgon-like American socialite Edythe Van Hopper (Played with true verve by Florence Bates: \"Give me a chocolate quick!\" she cries as she stubs her umpteenth cigarette out in a jar of cold cream). After a whirlwind courtship and fast Italian honeymoon, de Winter brings his bride to the ancestral estate of Manderley. The second Mrs. de Winter is not happy in her new home, which seems to be overshadowed by the presence of Maxim's first wife Rebecca, dead for some time in a boating accident. Matters are not helped by her own complete ineptitude in her new position of Great Lady, or the hostility of the housekeeper, black-clad Mrs. Danvers (superbly incarnated by Dame Judith Anderson in the only successful one-note performance in movie history), who seems to have a strange fixation on her dead mistress, keeping Rebecca's clothes, personal possessions and rooms exactly as they were during Rebecca's lifetime. De Winter himself behaves like a different man - brooding, gloomy, temperamental and even verbally abusive. Poor Joan Fontaine blames herself for her predicament, contrasting her awkward plainness with Rebecca's alleged poise, grace and popularity...After a disastrous development during a costume ball, matters seem even more hopeless when Rebecca's previously-undiscovered body turns up out of nowhere, and it seems Mr. de Winter has a lot of explaining to do...Strong plot and performances aside, this film has a truly unique atmosphere - George Barnes' Oscar-winning cinematography transforms Manderley into a Gothic symphony of light and shadow where unseen forces seem about to manifest themselves at every turn. Perhaps the greatest bit of showmanship is the way the dead, absent Rebecca becomes a major character - in the stunning and very perverse sequence (\"Feel this...\") where Mrs. Danvers shows the new Mrs. de Winter Rebecca's things, you can SEE Rebecca in your head while \"Danny\" speaks.

Laurence Olivier, one of Britain's finest stage and film actors(you only have to see him in Shakespeare to know the talent this man had), gives a towering performance as Maxim De Winter, a broken man haunted by his first wife's death. The lovely Joan Fontaine is the picture of innocence and vulnerability as the 2nd Mrs De Winter, giving a genuine sense of fright and emotion throughout. Also superb is the suave George Sanders as the rather loathsome blackmailing Favel, who smirks and makes acidic remarks as effortlessly as Clark Gable did in Gone With The wind.

However, it was inevitable that he would find his way to Hollywood, and along with famous producer David O. Selznick, he adapted Daphne du Maurier's classic book into a thrilling and tense story about obsession, death and the effects and memories we all take with us long after someone moves onto the next world.What makes this such an interesting picture is the fact that Hitchcock was able to adapt some new and ground-breaking ideas into the filming process which obviously improves the quality of the experience as well as usher in a whole new way to create movies. He storyboarded every scene, used deep-focus photography and edited the picture \"in camera,\" in other words only shooting what he wanted to see on the screen. This gave him a complete vision of what he wanted as well as kept the nosy Selznick's hands away from his product. What it leaves us today is spellbound, suspended and amazed at what he was able to do with a camera; in some ways 40 years ahead of its time. Though he would not receive as much credit as Orson Welles one year later with Citizen Kane, he nevertheless left behind a stirring story filled with complex and emotional people who bring us along on this strange and mysterious journey.The movie never would have been as great without an all-star cast, which Hitchcock had with Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine as the two lovers separated by the dead Rebecca's presence as well as supporting characters Judith Anderson as the obsessed housekeeper Mrs. Danvers and the slick and sneaky George Sanders. The narrative feels to bend a little in the final third as we are brought along to figure this dilemma out in a routine police investigation. Nevertheless, filled with dazzling images of Manderley, a completely convincing performance by the beautiful Fontaine and Hitchcock's ability to have Rebecca cast a shadow over the characters despite being dead, this is a classic not to be missed and one that needs multiple views before the mystery is cleared up.

Laurence Olivier is convincing as the brooding Maxim de Winter--a man unable to forget his first wife, Rebecca, who died a mysterious death. That presents a big problem for Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs. de Winter. She is a young and fragile newlywed who finds herself in a dark and confusing situation. She cannot fathom Maxim's many mood changes and his cold demeanor and she feels everyone is comparing her to the first Mrs. de Winter.This begs the question why did she marry him in the first place? Was she blinded by his scholarly manners or his offer of a comfortable life? Whatever he presented in courtship changed as soon as he returned to Manderley. He never seemed to grasp the fact that she felt out of place and was confused as to her role as lady of the manor.Some argue that Fontaine was too weak in the role, but I could not find a false note in any of her scenes. She started out as a mousy girl in love who was dependent on a strange, distant husband for everything. But, she fought her way to the truth about the first Mrs. de Winter and became a strong woman at the end of the film.Character actors, a Hitchcock staple, are a big plus in \"Rebecca\" as Dame Judith Anderson, Nigel Bruce, Gladys Cooper and George Sanders bolster the film. Anderson is amazing as Mrs. Danvers, the manor's housekeeper, whose presence seems to cast a cold and foreboding pall over everything. Her formal manner also has de Winter's new bride completely mesmerized and the give and take between the two actresses becomes a battle of sorts. Maxim seems unaware of the tension between the two and he seemingly has no fear of Mrs. Danvers even though she is so much a part of his tragic past.Although unspoken throughout, Hitchcock resurrects the memory of Rebecca as a tool to haunt all aspects of this film. From beginning to end, there is the strange feeling that she is still alive somehow and has returned to Manderley to claim her rightful place.In 1940, Hitchcock could well have used color for this film, but black and white proved to be an excellent choice. The dark shadows and fog just make the mansion that much more eerie and that includes the billowy curtains, which take on a life of their own when the wind blows.This film was Hitchcock's first \"modern\" picture, seemingly eons away from his small British movies of the 1930s. It is a Hollywood studio film (in the best sense) and David Selznick's production skills are evident as the \"look\" of the movie is very good even by today's standards.

It suits the movie that its being shot in black & white and all but the atmosphere is just not as good, moody and horror Gothic like as everyone tries to make you believe it is. The story just simply doesn't allow this.The movie has a typical solid '40's cast, with popular actors such as Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine and popular supporting actors such as George Sanders, Nigel Bruce and Gladys Cooper involved. It was especially nice to see Laurence Olivier in an Hitchcock movie, two Hollywood legends working together. The acting is overall good in this movie though it tends to become a bit overly melodramatic at times.Give credit where credit is due. This is a good movie but no way a classic, or among Hitchcock's best work. Oh well, seems that just not a lot of people agree with me on this, also considering that this movie won an Oscar for best picture in 1941.

But the mystery departs the film around the three-quarters mark, and the enigmatic spell of the movie goes with it.

Couple of comments in the movie that have led me to this question are the Dr.'s comment at the end of the movie that \"Mrs. Danvers had been coming to see him for years\". Also that Rebecca uses the name Mrs. Danvers. The other thing that makes it possible is that Rebecca had a sordid past, according to Max's narration of their visit 4 days after their marriage.Also, Mrs. Danver's complete obsession with Rebecca, ultimately leading to her own similar deamatic suicide ( a wish to die in the same method as she believed Rebecca died), and destroying Manerlay in the process. That Manderlay was made into its current style by Rebecca also adds a bit more to my conclusion. It is also very obvious the cousin is not really a cousin for many obvious reasons.

A year before Fontaine was just a mousy supporting player before being cast as the mousy lead in this classic adaptation of the Daphne DuMaurier novel, one of the finest of all literary adaptations, (the screenplay is credited to Robert E Sherwood and Joan Harrison). Fontaine was born for the role and was never this good again and the Oscar she should have won, they gave her the following year for a much less interesting performance in \"Suspicion\", (ah, the good old days of sympathy voting). But then all the performances in \"Rebecca\" are perfect; few films are this well cast.Olivier is simply extraordinary as Maxim DeWinter, the dour master of Manderlay. The year before he was a magnificent Heathcliffe, the dour master of Wuthering Heights, but his performance here is even finer. It is an intuitive piece of acting, as good as anything he did in later years, finding the deep, dark heart of a character that might have been merely novelletish if played by someone else. And then there's Judith Anderson's definitive Mrs Danvers who transcends the potential pantomime villainy of the part with a wonderfully subtle piece of acting. Elsewhere, there isn't a duff performance in site, (Florence Bates' Edythe Van Hopper is particularly treasureable).Indeed this is one of the few screen adaptations of a good book that improves on the original; the acting alone would see to that, but it is also psychologically astute and as one would expect, magnificently directed by Hitchcock who molds the material into another study of somewhat ordinary, average people caught up in extraordinary events. In this respect it's as recognizably Hitchcockian as many of his later films, and like the best of his later work it stands up to repeated viewings.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "One of the finest of all literary adaptations", "date": "2008-09-19T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1948344", "sentiment score": [0.0093, 0.0607, 0.241, 0.5449, 0.1441]}, {"content": "If 1939 was Hollywood's greatest year, 1940 certainly followed it mighty close. And of all 1940's marvelous movies, Rebecca is one of the most enduringly entertaining. In fact, it has not dated in the slightest and is still one of the most suspensefully intriguing, rivetingly fascinating of all Hollywood's essays into the realm of the romantic Gothic thriller. Among many reasons for this success, I offer the following thoughts at random: (1) Daphne du Maurier is one of the most talented and articulate writers in this field and her novel has been expertly adapted; (2) despite his disclaimers, Rebecca is the sort of movie at which Hitchcock excels. It has a brooding atmosphere of mystery and horror that Hitchcock is able to play up to such an extent that it becomes more important than the plot. This is a major triumph because when boiled down, the plot is actually rather familiar, even (dare we say it?) trite. Hitchcock's creation of this richly pervading atmosphere which leads to such a complete suspension of our minds, is achieved by his masterly control of pacing, acting, composition; and his ability to influence photographer, composer and set designers to produce the right effects. Notice, for example, that Manderley is really a castle of the mind. It is too shadowy, too remote, too unreal because it is in the mind. It exists now only in the heroine's mind. \"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again.\" As these words are visualized on the screen, we don't see a real Manderley, but a Manderley of the mind, a nightmare, a ghost. This is Hitchcock at his most accomplished. Never mind Foreign Correspondent with all its showy bags of directorial tricks. There are just as many brilliant displays of legerdemain in Rebecca, but they are thrice as effective because they are so imperceptible, so subtle; (3) Rebecca is blessed with a most gifted cast. Joan Fontaine is exactly right and never gave a finer performance. It is really a most difficult role. The heroine in these Gothic romances is frequently some colorlessly bland little mouse of incredibly limited experience. Joan takes this stereotype and works on it with such persuasion that she brings the character not only to a vivid life, but to an astounding pitch of audience sympathy and identification. Olivier also delivers an admirably judged performance, giving de Winter effective shades of moodiness.

Producer David Selznick had just had a great movie the previous year (Gone with the Wind, 1939) and signed on Alfred Hitchcock for the first Hollywood movie by Hitchcock (his earlier movies were all British). What is less known is that in the entire fabulous career of Alfred Hitchcock, Rebecca was the only movie that won him a Best Picture award. And that too in the year 1940, when competition was fierce with the movie, 'Grapes of Wrath', 'The Great Dictator', and 'The Philadelphia Story'.With an outstanding cast and perfect control of the actors, Hitchcock, who resisted the domination of Selznick in his projects, manages to weave out of Daphne Du Maurier's novel, a Hitchcock psychological thriller. Somewhat against Hitchcock's intent, the story indeed is fairly true to the novel, with a few exceptions necessary to satisfy American censor boards.The movie opens with waves crashing against rocks and a narrative by the protagonist, who will never be given a first name, only Mrs De Winter as the plot unfolds. We meet for the first time the silent but dominant character of the estate of Manderley, the ancestral home of Mr. DeWinter. It is a stunning edifice and more than a little imposing.Flashback to the beginning of the story, to Monte Carlo. A young woman who is a paid companion to an overbearing pompous society matron sees a man brooding, overlooking the cliff. She yells 'stop' thinking him about to jump. Irritably he sends her off.....How the movie unfolds you got to see that yourself. The movie was a great success both critically and financially.

What did happen to the first lady of the house? Can this newly married couple survive the oppressive cloud that looms large over the mansion?A Gothic emotional near masterpiece, Alfred Hitchcock's first American film may seem a bit too serviceable at times, something he was also aware of himself, but the production values are high and the story is played out supremely well. Within the story we can find Hitchcock's now famous trait of mistrusting Women, but in the main it stays the tragic tale of one young woman living in the ominous shadow of the previous Mrs. De Winter. Mood is often set as foreboding, with the director understanding the psychological pangs of the source material once the action switches to the de Winter home of Manderley. It arguably is a touch too long, and the restraint of Hitchcock, down to producer David O. Selznick overseeing things, stops it being a bit more unnerving than it should be.For Manderley the mansion here is one of the finest put on the screen, this is because Hitchcock and brilliant cinematographer George Barnes manage to make it bold & beautiful one minute, and then the next scene it comes off as a monolithic nightmare. It's wonderful case of the surroundings playing the extra character for maximum effect. Laurence Olivier is impressive, even if we would learn later on that this is the sort of performance he could do in his sleep. The supporting cast do great work as well, especially as regards the cold and terrifying turn from Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers. However, to me this will always be Joan Fontaine's show, she nails it perfectly, the new Mrs. De Winter wants to do right but can't seem to so for doing wrong, she infuriates at times, yet the next minute you just want to hold her, for she's so vulnerable, but beautifully so, it's a brilliant performance in a brilliant film. The ending is a switheroo from the novel, and it almost derails the success the film has achieved up to that point. And looking at it now it's hard not to curse the Production Code for enforcing a big change to what was revealed in du Maurier's wonderful novel.

Films such as 'The Man Who Knew Too Much (1934),' 'The 39 Steps (1935)' and 'The Lady Vanishes (1938)' became both critical and commercial successes, and so it was only a matter of time before he was tempted over to Hollywood to pursue even greater fame and fortune. Though his working relationship with independent producer David O. Selznick proved constantly frustrating \u0096 Selznick often demanded a large amount of creative control over his films \u0096 their very first collaboration proved one of Hitchcock's most successful, with 'Rebecca (1940)' becoming his only film to win Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Based on Daphne du Maurier's 1938 novel of the same name, 'Rebecca' is a tense, atmospheric Gothic melodrama about the lingering influence of the story's unseen title character, long after her own death.Relative newcomer Joan Fontaine plays a young, modest woman who falls in love with a wealthy widower, Maxim de Winter (Laurence Olivier), who still apparently mourns the death of his wife, Rebecca. Following a humble wedding in Monte Carlo, the two lovers return to Maxim's sprawling Manderley estate in Cornwall, England, where the servants \u0096 especially the chillingly creepy Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) \u0096 find it difficult to accept this young bride as the new Mrs. de Winter. Whenever Fontaine's character finds herself within the walls of her new home, the atmosphere in each of the rooms is discomforting, even suffocating, as she struggles vainly to assimilate into a world for which she is unsuited. Her character symbolically remains without a given name, reinforcing the story's stance that she is without an individual identity; as long as she remains with Maxim, she will continue to be evaluated against Rebecca, and will be forever in the lingering shadow of Maxim's long-dead, \"perfect\" previous wife.The Master of Suspense certainly knew how to make an entrance into Hollywood, and 'Rebecca' is definitely one of his top ten films {out of the twenty-seven that I've seen thus far}. Though, at 130 minutes, it is one of the longest motion pictures that Hitchcock ever produced, the film never drags nor feels overly cumbersome, with the extended running time merely prolonging the suffering that the audience must endure through Fontaine's innocent, continually-threatened character. This isn't the sort of thriller that lulls you into a false sense of security and then shocks you, since that was simply not Hitchcock's style. Like another Gothic thriller of which I am fond, George Cukor's 'Gaslight (1944),' the main character is forever at ill-ease with her surroundings, and we, as the audience, are never afforded the luxury of feeling safe and secure. Rebecca de Winter is one of the most meticulously-detailed unseen characters in the history of cinema, and, without the story ever straying into supernatural territory, it seems as though her lingering presence is somehow orchestrating the disturbing events of the film.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 6, "votes": 9}, "heading": "\"She knew everyone that mattered.

After producer David Selznick shelled out fifty thousand dollars for the screen rights to the Daphne Du Maurier novel, he hired on Hitchcock to direct the movie. The team up with Selznick was immediately fraught with disagreement. Selznick didn't like Hitchcock's contribution to an early screenplay treatment, and brought in his own team, thereby making \"Rebecca\" the only picture by Hitchcock that didn't have his collaboration on the script. Hitch didn't want Joan Fontaine as the female lead, Selznick didn't want Olivier. The producer also had difficulty with Hitchcock's directorial method, thinking him too slow in his approach. The result - nothing short of brilliant! Most of my appreciation of the film lies in the performance of Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs. de Winter. Her early appearance is marked by the tenuous acceptance of her role as the mistress of Manderley, constantly ill at ease in the presence of such formality and elegance. Very quickly, Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson) becomes her nemesis out of a fierce loyalty to the unseen title character. That bears mentioning, as the first Mrs. de Winter, who is deceased, holds the viewer in an unrelenting grip throughout the story. The constant reminders of the elegant first wife of Maxim de Winter (Olivier) keep one constantly riveted on the unraveling of the Manderley mystery.Though he was top billed, I never got the impression that this was a Laurence Olivier picture. He seems to appear from time to time to remind the viewer that Manderley is part of the de Winter fortune, but it's the war of nerves between Fontaine's character and Mrs. Danvers that give the film much of it's psychological tension. The latter third of the picture that reveals the nature of Rebecca's demise provides the twist that clears Maxim of a murder charge, but it would have been even better to see Jack Favell (George Sanders) twist in the wind over his unfounded accusation.Say, I couldn't help it, but the picture's ending had me making a comparison to another film classic, \"Citizen Kane\".

Thus, began the history of acclaim for Hitchcock's remarkable career as a motion picture & television show director. Both of \"Rebecca's\" lead actors, Sir Laurence Olivier ('Maxim' de Winter) & Joan Fontaine ('Madam' de Winter), were nominated for Oscars, as well. Original music by Franz Waxman provides a combination of eerie, erotic, moody & emotive orchestration effects. George Barnes won \"Rebecca's\" 2nd Oscar for Best Cinematography in Black & White.Novelist Daphne Du Maurier's plot certainly wouldn't work nearly as well without the spooky head housekeeper of the de Winters' castle, Manderley: Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson). Danvers entered Manderley with Rebecca (de Winter), Maxim's first wife who left him a widower & left Danvers obsessed with her. The nearly unspoken memory of Rebecca is the haunting aspect that Hitchcock expertly raises from the dead throughout this film to its magnificent end. Fontaine & Olivier deliver superb starring performances of Du Maurier's novel's protagonists through Philip MacDonald's & Michael Hogan's adaptation and Robert E. Sherwood's & Joan Harrison's screenplay. The two fall in love on vacation in Monte Carlo, marry & return to Maxim de Winter's castle on a craggy coastal cliff in England. Fontaine's Mrs. de Winter is young, unassuming & constantly feels out of place due to Danvers' psychological torment by comparing Maxim's new wife with his dead one. Danvers contrasts Rebecca's perfection to the newlywed's shortcomings. Fontaine's Madame de Winter is led to believe that everyone was \"enchanted\" by Rebecca, even as she knows of her own plain, unpretentious simplicity. The historical atmosphere of Rebecca seemingly shrouding Manderley has the effect of nearly driving Fontaine's de Winter nuts. Before the true mystery of Rebecca is revealed, a shipwreck near Manderley forces Maxim to tell his new wife the truth about Rebecca. That's when everything the film builds the audience up for starts to unfold. Unlike so many psychological suspenses, Hitchcock's delivers a grand flood of surprises & unpredictable twists up to the very end.A note of interest: 9 of Hitchcock's motion pictures still rank in the top 250 today on IMDb.com. \"Rebecca\" is currently #75.

Overrated it might be, but it STILL is a very good and interesting film.First, I'll complain about a few things--then discuss all the good about the film. The original story by Daphne du Maurier was a lot more risqu\u00e9 than the film--with a bisexual story line that is only barely hinted at in the movie. You really can't blame the film makers for this, as the Hollywood Production Code wouldn't allow this plot line to be pursued. So, instead, Rebecca was promiscuous but only with men. In addition, I am really amazed that Joan Fontaine received the Best Actress Oscar for this film. Her character often stared into space and appeared more slow-witted or annoying than just a \"fish out of water\". My daughter watched the film with me and said \"why is that lady acting so twitchy?\". In other words, she behaved in a rather strange and inexplicable manner during some of the film--particularly when she was at Mandalay. Also, I really couldn't understand why the DeWinters kept their crazy old housekeeper--after all, she tried to drive the mistress of the house to suicide. Isn't this grounds for termination of her services?!!Now, despite these complaints that definitely mar the film, there was so much to like about the movie. The script was daring and creative despite the limitations. Most times I see a movie, I say to myself that it reminds me of some other films I've seen, but in this case REBECCA is truly unique and creative. The film also had many, many twists and turns and provided one of the best endings I have seen in some time. In addition, I also liked the camera-work and music, as they created a wonderful ambiance. Despite being a black and white film, it was a beautiful picture.So my advice is to definitely see the film but just be prepared to ignore the plot holes.

She says that her late father was a \"lovely and unusual person\",indicating that Maxim referred to her last name as well as her first.When he sent her a note earlier apologizing for being rude while with Mrs Van Hoppper and her,she remarked that her name on the envelope was spelled correctly,that being unusual.I think that in the author's own mind,she gave the heroine her own name, Daphne Du Maurier,an unusual(for England) and graceful name,identifying completely with the character.This movie has been criticized for not going very deeply into the characters motives,etc.Unfortunately that is what happens when you turn a long and complex novel into a two hour movie.There just isn't time,and you loose a lot.Frank Crawley,for example,described as \"colorless\" and \"dull\" at first,turns out to be a complex and interesting character,Maxim's best friend.It is a pity that the mini series was not around then.There are two faults with this movie,one minor,the other major.Manderly is described as have grace and sweep and symmetry,but the Victorian Gothic jumble of buildings shown has none.More important is the change in the nature of the death of Rebecca from murder to accident.The writers,handed this problem by the Hay's Office rule that nobody could get away with murder,didn't handle it very well.Not only is her death accidental,but it looks perfectly accidental and innocent,so there was no reason for Maxim to incriminate himself by getting rid of the body.They could have either had an accident that LOOKED like murder,ie.she falls on a marlinspike,or she shoots herself in the heart to frame Maxim,something Rebecca would be fully capable of.Movie versions of novels should be regarded as supplements to,rather than substitutions for,reading the original novel.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Perfect cast for the novel", "date": "2007-01-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1567557", "sentiment score": [0.0581, 0.3164, 0.3761, 0.2232, 0.0262]}, {"content": "It's silly for those who complain that Hitchcock did not put his usual stamp on this film--and then they cite VERTIGO, MARNIE, SHADOW OF A DOUBT, etc., etc.--when all the time Hitchcock himself has said that this was not a typical Hitchcock film per se.

Selznick insisted that they be as faithful as possible to the original material.And it works. REBECCA is a marvelous film, notable for the casting of the up until then rather unknown JOAN FONTAINE in the lead (which gave Selznick and Hitchcock many headaches as they tried to exact the kind of performance they wanted from her), at a time when Fontaine was regarded in Hollywood as a second-rate \"wooden\" actress who had only done a bunch of supporting roles in \"A\" films and leads in \"B\" films. She certainly proved herself up to the task.I think her performance is well nigh perfect, suggesting the timid, insecure young woman who is intimidated first, by her worldly husband, Maxim deWinter, and then by his domineering and sinister housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (JUDITH ANDERSON). But if there is one major fault, it is that I never really felt the chemistry between Max deWinter (LAURENCE OLIVIER) and Fontaine. It's as if he has all he can do to merely smile at her--he seems to be tolerating her rather than really loving her.Maybe that's because, as good an actor as he was, he was unable to show any real affection for a woman he personally wished were not playing his wife. (It's well documented that there was no mutual admiration going on between Olivier and Fontaine), although she did respect the fact that he could do everything exactly the same in take after take. Not only did he treat her with only lukewarm consideration, but she had to contend with Hitchcock who claims he had to devise all sorts of things to keep her performance on track.Whatever, the end result is what counts and REBECCA is impeccably produced, written and scored (by Franx Waxman) with utmost respect for the DuMaurier story. Supporting roles are all capably played by a British cast including GEORGE SANDERS, NIGEL BRUCE, GLADYS COOPER, REGINALD DENNY, C.

It is for these scenes where she finally gathers some strength to help her troubled husband that Fontaine really deserves the most admiration. Her earlier scenes as the mousy heroine are just a bit overdone, in my opinion.And so, with the exception of a lack of real chemistry between the stars, I think REBECCA is another example of David O.

Selznick, who often exerted as much control over the way a picture turned as the director.The fact of Rebecca being such a highly regarded and well-known novel was clearly something of a straitjacket for such an independent and formulaic director as Hitchcock. There could be no major changes to the plot, little room for Hitchcock to squeeze in his trademark suspense and black humour. Hitch instead sticks to his other forte, using the arrangement of shots to convey mental states, true feelings and relationships between characters \u0096 and at that he is at his best here.

In a later scene at Manderlay we see Joan Fontaine sitting alone at a huge dining table, with the camera slowly pulling out to show her sense of isolation.Hitchcock also goes a long way in creating atmosphere with large wide open spaces, curtains blowing in the breeze and the way he moves actors in and out of the frame. Mrs Danvers' first entrance, walking arrogantly straight into the middle of the shot is particularly memorable. A brilliant example of how Hitch uses a few simple techniques to achieve a change in mood is when Maxim and Joan Fontaine are viewing a reel of home movies from their honeymoon. Halfway through they are interrupted by the butler with the news that an ornament belonging to Rebecca has gone missing, and Joan Fontaine owns up to breaking it, leading to an argument. Before the interruption the camera focuses on the projection screen, and we see footage of the newlyweds happy together. Afterwards however the camera ignores the screen and focuses on Olivier and Fontaine, their faces half-lit, emphasising the tense, awkward atmosphere.Another problem with faithfulness to the source novel means that the dialogue is often overly literary. Joan Fontaine's opening narration sounds particularly lofty. Luckily the two lead acting performances are good enough to carry it. Laurence Olivier is great as usual. I didn't like Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs de Winter on first viewing, but then I realised what was actually annoying me was the way the camera draws in on her and the music swells up for all her emotional moments, which is more the fault of Hitchcock and producer David O. Selznick. Overlooking this, her Best Actress Oscar was well deserved.Rebecca is an engrossing film, and one that stands up well to repeated viewings. It has to be said this is mostly down to Daphne du Maurier's gripping, twisting story. But credit has to go to Hitch for using the freedoms of cinematic technique to convey it. Aside from the minor flaws already mentioned, I can't really think of a better way it could have been done. Whatever the case, it has to rank among Hitchcock's finest films.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 4, "votes": 6}, "heading": "\"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderley again\"", "date": "2006-11-23T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1528054", "sentiment score": [0.042, 0.3007, 0.4, 0.236, 0.0213]}, {"content": "Daphne Du Maurier's novel becomes a handsome romantic-thriller from director Alfred Hitchcock involving a na\u00efve young woman (Joan Fontaine) who weds a wealthy, mysterious man (Laurence Olivier) and moves into his imposing castle filled with memories of his deceased first wife.

Rebecca invites you in slowly, and slowly builds on itself. A happy go lucky beginning quickly turns into a movie that touches themes of suicide (Max on the cliff), second marriages, lesbianism (Mrs. Danves and her obsession with Rebecca), incestuous relationships (Rebecca and Jack), murder, and more. Rebecca opens on a down note showing a beat up old mansion and reflecting on better times and then shows a man close to the edge of a cliff. The movie shifts to a happy-go-lucky romantic sugar movie. The well written script and the nervousness and light hearted acting done by Joan Fontiane. The movie quickly changes and soon begins to feel like a mystery or a ghost story with whispers of Rebecca and how no one talks about her and her presence being felt despite being dead for over a year. The camera movements, acting (especially from Mrs. Danvers) and lighting help achieve a suspenseful feel to the movie. The nervous out of place feel that the new Mrs. de Winter exhibits was done encouraged off screen by Hitchcock when Laurence Oliver (who plays Max de Winter) hated Joan Fontiane as the leading lady, this off screen chemistry added to the film. The movie keeps several things secret and keeps hinting ever so slightly at many things. At sometime I thought Rebecca was still alive, or that she was a ghost. The curious and light hearted attitude of the second Mrs. de Winter adds to building the suspense and helps keep the audience guessing and hoping the mystery will be reveled. When the secret of Rebecca's death is finally revealed the movie takes another shift to dramatic and a different suspenseful feel. This shift takes a toll on the new Mrs. de Winter and even characters in the movie spot this. Another important element is the presence of Rebecca throughout the movie. Rebecca is never shown and you never hear her voice, yet she's everywhere in the movie. Her 'R' symbol is almost like an omen within the house.The movie's core is the new Mrs. de Winter and her struggle to fit into her new life. She must learn how to live as a trophy wife, be a socialite, wife, wealthy, and live up to Rebecca, the first wife. Throughout the movie you hear whispers of how great Rebecca was and it takes it's toll on the new Mrs. de Winter, even to the point where she commands,\" I Am The New Mrs. de Winter.\"The cinematography is extremely well done and brings scenes to life. The happy go lucky young romance of Max and the new Mrs. de Winter is set in Monty Carlo, a city famous for royalty, thrills, beautiful landscape and luxury. The next location is the massive mansion Manderly, which at first looks inviting, but quickly feels old and empty like a mausoleum. The beach also has a foreboding feeling to it. The loud crashing waves, the fog and a cabin full of Rebecca's possessions.There was one thing that caught my eye is the acting by George Sanders(who plays Jack). A real distracting habit shown in the film is that George was blinking 5 times per second. Also, sadly the using an alias at a doctor's office could no longer work due to the paper work one must go through at a doctor's office.

Usually those two go together. John Ford won his second Oscar for Best Director for The Grapes of Wrath that year instead. Also Laurence Olivier, Joan Fontaine and Judith Anderson were nominated and all came up short.Off the top of my head I would say Vertigo, North By Northwest, Shadow of a Doubt, and Spellbound are all qualitatively better than Rebecca. Yet Rebecca does have a nice Gothic horror feel to it though there is nothing supernatural going on here.Laurence Olivier plays Maxim DeWinter, heir to the estate of Manderley who is in Monte Carlo looking to get away from the place because of the death of his first wife Rebecca. She was by all accounts a regal beauty who was the toast of society and he's in mourning for her loss. But he meets Joan Fontaine a nice, but plain sort of girl who is the paid companion of American dowager Florence Bates. Maybe because she's the opposite of Rebecca he's attracted to her. Fontaine grabs him on the spot when marriage is proposed.Fontaine has a lot of insecurities much like her character in a following Hitchcock film, Suspicion. They're not eased any by Judith Anderson the housekeeper of the big Manderley estate.Mrs. Danvers was Judith's career role. Before writing this review I remarked to someone else that I wonder what Mr. Danvers must have been like. It occurred to me later that there was no Mr. Danvers, he exists only as an excuse or a pretense so there would be no whispers about her unmarried status. She pretends to be a widow. There's more than just latent lesbianism in Judith Anderson's portrayal. She was totally in love with the late Rebecca DeWinter and I'm sure it got good and physical. She can't stand seeing anyone else in taking her place. Since it comes out that Rebecca was fooling around with her cousin George Sanders, why not a lesbian affair as well. If Rebecca were written today, Mrs. Danvers would be more openly lesbian.Rebecca was the first of Alfred Hitchcock's American films as well, though it was done here it was done by the English colony in Hollywood. Hitchcock never had budgets that Selznick gave him over in the UK. The sets depicting the grandeur of Manderley are an eye full.

The story revolves around a shy young woman who, having no family herself, is forced to serve as a paid companion to an obnoxious socialite named Mrs. Van Hopper, vacationing in Monte Carlo. While there, she meets a handsome but abrupt English widower named Maxim de Winter, who is staying at the same hotel and escorts her about. The innocent young woman is swept away by this mature and mysterious man, though she dares not reveal her emotions, given her lowly social position. Though there is strangely little romance involved, Maxim unexpectedly proposes marriage. The two wed and honeymoon abroad, then Maxim brings his bride home to his grand English country estate, Manderley. At Manderley the insecure, nameless second Mrs. de Winter is emotionally haunted by Maxim's first wife, the beautiful and accomplished Rebecca. Though Rebecca drowned many months earlier in a boating accident, her memory seems all too fresh in the minds of Maxim's sister Beatrice, his servants, and indeed Maxim himself. The haunting R's are everywhere...on the table linens, the lacy handkerchief, the address book, the dressing gown case. We never see so much as a photograph of the mysterious Rebecca, but her lingering presence is felt through both her possessions and the recollections of others. The domineering and foreboding housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, was personally devoted to Rebecca and exhibits unconcealed disdain for the new intruding and inadequate mistress of Manderley. When Danny shows Maxim's new bride the bizarre West Wing shrine she keeps to her former mistress, it seems as though Rebecca herself might walk in at any moment and use the nightgown and hairbrushes meticulously laid out for her.For me, the quality of any adaptation of this novel depends upon the persona of the second Mrs. de Winter. Joan Fontaine is sympathetic and endearing in the role, suitably shy and bewildered, but this actress is far too pretty! Maxim's new bride should be unglamorous, even plain and dowdy. Primarily for this reason, I prefer the 1979 serial version which has a perfectly cast Mrs. de Winter. However, Laurence Olivier is superb as the mature, sophisticated, often brooding, and occasionally rather nasty Maxim de Winter. The most masterful performance is definitely given by Judith Anderson as the dark, sinister, and menacing housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, whose chilling stare dominates much of the tale.Maxim's business agent and friend, Frank Crawley, is faithfully portrayed as a quiet, kind, and competent individual who is unfailingly loyal to Maxim. Beatrice is suitably forthright, Giles foolish and chubby, the servants appropriately formal, and Jack Favell utterly despicable. Mrs. Van Hopper is wonderfully captured as the rude, chattering, condescending, and altogether obnoxious socialite of the novel, fawning over the aristocracy. Her character is necessary in order to cement sympathy for her paid companion and her social situation. I found the Monte Carlo scenes well presented, though could hardly picture du Maurier's gauche heroine so comfortably at ease dancing with Maxim.The sets especially are brilliantly done, depicting Maxim's grand English country manor. I felt that I was literally standing in Manderley's grand hall with its incredible staircase. Library, morning room, dining room, upstairs galleries, Rebecca's bedroom, and boathouse are all perfectly captured. The Cornish coastal scenes with the haunting fog enshrouded sea are portrayed in typical eerie Hitchcock fashion. Even Jasper the spaniel is perfect!*** WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS *** According to the Hays Code, no movie could depict a murderer in a sympathetic light so the screenwriters were forced to cast Rebecca's death as an accident. Fortunately, I was aware of this in advance so managed the altered portrayal of events quite well. However, it certainly changed the flavour of this sinister tale. As appealing as the dewy eyed Joan Fontaine is, Hitchcock falls short in capturing Mrs. de Winter. He changes completely her role in the Manderley costume ball preparations by indicating that SHE herself is taking charge. In the book, Mrs. de Winter feels utterly inadequate and useless in these preparations as the domineering Mrs. Danvers organizes menus, flowers, music, and invitations. The worst outrage is his failure to depict the complete transformation of this awkward, insecure young woman, initially so ill at ease as mistress of Manderley and timid with the servants. Once she is assured of Maxim's love and no longer haunted by Rebecca, the novel's Mrs. de Winter immediately becomes a confident lady of the manor, scolding a maid and even taking on Mrs. Danvers. Yes, there IS one movie scene where she DOES defy the housekeeper, declaring, 'I am Mrs. de Winter now'. However, it's ALL WRONG, defeating its purpose by occurring BEFORE Maxim reveals the truth. Hitchcock is certainly a master of the thriller but totally missed the point here. The ball scenes are shortened due to time constraints, some of the later settings altered, and liberties taken with the conclusion. The novel's Mrs. de Winter is driving home from London with Maxim, rather than remaining behind at Manderley during the fire. The lovey dovey embrace with the implied 'happily ever after' ending is unfaithful to the book. Neither at the beginning nor elsewhere is the viewer ever informed that the de Winters are currently living abroad in obscure hotels on the Continent in self imposed exile. However, for those less concerned with accuracy to the novel, this movie is a haunting and engrossing romantic thriller with an extremely sympathetic heroine.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 8, "votes": 12}, "heading": "Marvelous, if not quite faithful, adaptation of du Maurier's thriller", "date": "2006-06-12T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1392224", "sentiment score": [0.0052, 0.0327, 0.2589, 0.5982, 0.105]}, {"content": "David O. Selznick might have had more of an influence over this production than some might think- as with many of his films- and he is the one who ended up receiving the Oscar, not director Alfred Hitchcok, for the 1940 mystery-drama-romance Rebecca. But it is to the credit of both that, for the most part, it looks as if both tried to stay out of each other's way and just put up as good as film as they could. And it is a credit to Hitchcock that with a certain change from what one might see in his perhaps more entertaining films of the 50's and 60's also shows his knack at making great romantic Hollywood movie-making. He is given a plethora of the best of English acting talents (Olivier of course is hyped and hyped again just like Brando, but his work is undeniably good here, and yet it's Joan Fontaine who quietly makes her mark quite powerfully even when she is reserved in scenes), lush sets and production decor, a solid 'studio' score by Frank Waxman, and some memorable sequences and set-pieces. There is also some solid storytelling as well with his usual knack at unraveling a mystery piece by piece, with love, loss and deception at the core.Part of the film's success, however, is as attributable to the factor of it being one of the best \"chick-flicks\" in history that the film works today. And this time I mean it pretty much as a compliment, perhaps more to Selznick than anyone (Gone with the Wind, of course). The appeal that might usually go mostly for women is not lost at all on the male audience due to the sheer power and hints at what the two main actresses go for. Fontaine is the \"2nd\" Mrs. De Winter, who elopes with the Mr. played by Olivier and goes to live in Manderlay and meets some of the family and other folks. One of these is the one who has maybe the most interesting (naturally, as the antagonist) character, Mrs. Danvers played by Judith Anderson. Her's is a cold, exacting kind of character who has the straightforward, stern attitude of the ma'am of the house, but also with some dark secrets. It's not to say Hitchcock doesn't hav his eye out for other supporting parts and characters (I liked particularly the old guy who's at the shack where the majority of the secrets are house). But he also is able to get the character the audience will dislike the most as the more fascinating of the bunch, and Anderson is up to task.I wouldn't rush to see this as the first Hithcock film to see if you haven't seen one yet, but as an example of what he could direct aside from his outrageous and masterpiece works in the following years this is a fit example.

Instead, we have a well-made movie whose mystery and suspense depends mostly on the haunting aspects of the cinematography and the premise: Widower Maxim De Winter (ably performed by the one and only Laurence Olivier)cannot ignore his dark past and his dead wife Rebecca, whose shadow, memory and \"ghost\" still haunts the country estate of Mandalay. Nonetheless, he makes the mistake of remarrying again. After a brief romance, he marries a naive and social-climbing young woman (Joan Fontaine) who knows absolutely nothing of the dark secrets contained within Mandalay and how strongly Wife No. 1 Rebecca has affected the lives of its occupants. Rebecca never appears in the film and remains only a mentioned character (though we do see what she looked like in a portrait). Judith Anderson, in a terrific performance, portrays Mrs. Danvers, the housekeeper and Rebecca's most devoutly loyal friend and guardian. Mrs. Danvers resents Wife No. 2 and is openly hostile to her, claiming she can never be anything like the great Rebecca. The first part of the film can easily be mistaken for Bronte's \"Jane Eyre\", with its sprawling and haunting mansion and \"dark secret about the first wife\". But toward the end, the film takes on a different style - the courtroom drama. Even as such, the film is consistent and full of suspense, keeping us to the edge of our seats (I imagine audiences at the time were). If not quite faithful to the Daphne Du Maurier novel, it represents cinema of old Hollywood, which was full of great acting and great drama, the likes of which we don't see today. These actors live their roles, their British background in theater serves them well. This is also Hitchcock at his most versatile. He creates a powerful film, and one whose scenes are still ingrained in people's memories, such as the scene in which Joan Fontaine dresses up, unknowingly, like Rebecca to a costume ball and upsets the guest and Maxim and the final scenes, in which Mrs. Danvers, in a fit of rage after Wife No. 2 is found innocent in the trial and will indeed become the next mistress of Mandalay, sets fire to the home.

In the book, the lead characters go on to live their lives after Manderlay burned down in another far way place.This film has all the ingredients that go down well with most audiences\u0097two superb performances (Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs. de Winter and Dame Judith Anderson as the housekeeper with lesbian attachments) and the realistic special effects that recreated Manderlay within the studio. If people were wide-eyed at the performance of Olivier in this film, I suggest they see a British film called \"A Term of Trial\" directed by Peter Glenville, which has a story with quaint similarities to Olivier's role in \"Rebecca\" to see the thespian at his best.What is Hitchcock's contribution beyond the fine performances of the ladies? He was able to capture the sinister quality of Manderlay (just as the house of the murderer in \"Psycho\") in the opening sequence through spoken words and visuals and the burning of Manderlay at the end by light on the faces of people viewing the spectacle. He was probably aware that the basic material of du Maurier was the flip side of \"Blackmail,\" one of his early films with a gender reversal. He was probably thinking of reworking elements of \"Rebecca\" in \"Suspicion\" a film he made 3 years later.\"Rebecca\" might have won awards but in terms of cinema it pales in comparison with four Hitchcock films \"Notorious,\" \"Saboteur,\" \"Sabotage,\" and \"Blackmail.\" Interestingly, this is a rare Hitchcock film that presents women who gain in strength \u0097other rare examples being \"Marnie\" and \"Spellbound.\"", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 6}, "heading": "Daphne du Maurier and the actresses carry the film", "date": "2006-04-10T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1338125", "sentiment score": [0.0076, 0.0309, 0.1387, 0.5902, 0.2327]}, {"content": "Rebecca is a very VERY densely layered drama about a newly married woman who discovers that the deceased former wife, Rebecca, still casts a VERY large shadow over the estate.

Ironically, it's more British than his British work is, and the great thing about it is that it brings out the spirit of the novel, as opposed to being typical Hitchcock work.What a cast! Laurence Olivier (my fave actor and god) as the sardonic Maxim de Winter, Joan Fontaine as the second Mrs de Winter, George Sanders as the blackmailing cadish Jack Favell, Judith Anderson as the evil Mrs Danvers, Reginald Denny as the faithful Frank Crawley, Gladys Cooper as Mrs Lacey, Nigel Bruce as Mr Lacey, there are several others but we will be here forever if I name them all. But what I am trying to say, EVERYONE in the cast is just so brilliant, you cannot single one out as a best performance when all these talented actors all give it their 100% best.The plot is done straightforwardly and not in the slightest bit difficult to understand, about a man who has been widowed for over a year, marries a young nervous girl and brings her to his mansion. however, the memory of Maxim de Winter's first wife 'Rebecca' who was loved by everyone but was a cruel, spitefull, shallow rebellious woman, is constantly kept alive by the sinister housekeeper Mrs Danvers (why Judith Anderson never won the Best Supporting Actress Oscar for this I'll never know), the new wife and Maxim have to constantly battle against the dead Rebecca's popularity and it is a real scary journey for them, it's an alliance between a gawky virgin and a widowed sadist, a woman who's past is so blank that she doesn't even possess a name and a man who's past is so dark and horrible that he has contemplated suicide. You might find it a bit weird first time when you watch it, but honest to god, if you enjoy all genres of film, you will love this. As I said before, it is stupid to single out someone for giving the best performance in this film, but I suppose the one who commands your attention the most overall has to be Judith Anderson as Mrs Danvers. Perfect settings, perfect costumes and a perfect film. I have no issues with this film at all. I am now reading Daphne du Maruier's novel and am enjoying that too. The novel is loosely inspired by Charlotte Bronte's Jane Eyre, Joan Fontaine played Jane eyre in a 1944 production of Bronte's novel with Orson Welles but was nowhere near as good in that as she is in this. However, back to the point, great great film. Please watch it when you can, you will love it. Enjoy.*Laurence Olivier was immensely rude to Joan Fontaine and caused her weeks of misery during filming. Why? He was p*ssed of the Vivien Leigh (his then wife) didn't have the part and took it out on Fontaine.

I'm not sure why but it may be because at the time, it was a film more associated with David O. Selznick in the afterglow of \"Gone With the Wind\" than with Hitchcock who was making his first picture in Hollywood. Sixty-five years have elapsed and diminished the perception of Selznick's then-powerful influence. Suffice it to say that \"Rebecca\" survives as one of Hitchcock's most atmospheric masterworks, beautifully filmed by George Barnes and with two superb lead performances by Laurence Olivier and Joan Fontaine. Major credit needs to go yet again to the Criterion Collection for restoring the original beauty of the black-and-white film from a pristine print and resuscitating a clear soundtrack. The result is well worth revisiting even if you have already seen it in earlier forms.The full-blooded plot is intricately based on the way Du Maurier sets up the two main characters. At the center of the story is a na\u00efve, unadorned young woman working as a hired travel companion for the selfish Mrs. Van Hopper. Because of her testy employer, she ends up on the French Riviera where by chance, she meets Maxim DeWinter, a brooding, wealthy widower. DeWinter is energized by the young woman and decides to marry her on the spot. The newlyweds return to DeWinter's residence, the foreboding estate called Manderley. The young woman's insecurity is heightened by the cold housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers, who takes an immediate dislike to the new Mrs. DeWinter. Mrs. Danvers's adoration is reserved strictly for Rebecca, Maxim's first wife. At first, the new wife is completely intimidated by the manipulative Mrs. Danvers, but over time, she takes stock and becomes a more formidable presence until a revelation threatens to destroy her marriage. As the film plays itself out, the young woman discovers the real cause of Rebecca's death and gains strength in providing support for her tortured husband.In her first important role, the 23-year old Fontaine captures the right mix of deepening anxiety and innocence in portraying a woman so insecure as to not have a name in the story (she is referred to as \"The Second Mrs. DeWinter\" in the credits). Fresh from his equally ominous turn as Heathcliff in William Wyler's \"Wuthering Heights\", Olivier plays older, and it suits his polished manner much more as a well-bred man trapped by his personal demons. In a role that has been parodied endlessly ever since, Judith Anderson expertly plays the implacable Mrs. Danvers with a foreboding chill with her overly modulated tones. I do have to admit there are some moments -especially as she holds the candles near her tersely twisted face - when you almost want to laugh from the overemphasized dramatic effect.Smaller roles are filled expertly by familiar faces - George Sanders, a full decade before his acerbic Addison DeWitt in \"All About Eve\", plays a far more bald-faced scoundrel but with the same smarmy panache as Jack Favell; the befuddling Nigel Bruce and a relatively sympathetic Gladys Cooper expertly portray Maxim's brother-in-law and wife; and in the early going, Florence Bates makes a wonderfully wicked Mrs. Van Hopper. Once the center of the mystery has been exposed, the film does move quickly toward its conclusion running somewhat counter to the pacing Hitchcock uses in the story set-up. Regardless, many of his touches are on full display, especially the distorted camera angles and creative use of lighting. It all makes for grand entertainment.The Criterion DVD is a wonderful two-disc set with expert commentary provided by film historian Leonard Leff, the author of \"Hitchcock and Selznick\". It's obvious that he has studied this film intensely and come up with some golden nuggets of insight regarding the film machinations and the treatment of various plot developments. The second disc for true aficionados with an in-depth Du Maurier biography; numerous Selznick memos (for which he was most famous) on the ongoing production; more recent interviews that Leff conducted with Fontaine and Anderson; and most interestingly, archived footage of screen tests with actresses far more established than Fontaine at the time - Vivien Leigh, Loretta Young, Margaret Sullivan, a seventeen-year old Anne Baxter. Except for Baxter, who brings a touching Oedipal twist to her audition, it becomes clear how hopelessly wrong these beautiful actresses are for Fontaine's role and instead would have been ideal as Rebecca.

When it comes time for Van Hopper to return to America, De Winter proposes and the girl gratefully becomes Mrs de Winter. Moving in with him at his Cornwall estate, Mrs de Winter cannot believe the change in her life from being barked at by Van Hopper, to now being waited on by a large staff.The idea of a marriage where the wife is constantly compared to the husband's previous wife sounded like a melodrama to me but I felt confident that Hitchcock and the assembled cast must have done something more interesting with it than just making a sentimental weepy. And indeed I was right because this has the air of a romance that turns dark, that breeds fear and develops into a mystery film of sorts. The story is twisty and very engaging and I was held by it; it does have the approach of a melodrama but it is far from that thanks to the dark air of foreboding that Hitchcock gives it. The girl's appealing nervousness is well turned in on itself by the \"ghost\" of Rebecca. It is done in a gripping way and when truths come out, it may head in a different direction but it is just as satisfying.The cast are pretty much all great. Fontaine dominates the first half of the film in the same way that Rebecca dominates her characters life. Throughout the film, we never know her characters first or maiden name and this helps set up a lack of strong identity that Fontaine plays off really well. Her nervous, shy girl is totally convincing and in real life I know several people like her \u0096 people who allow themselves to be taken over by stronger characters and Fontaine did well to allow that to happen without ever having the person doing it on the screen.

The rest of the cast are all impressive in terms of faces \u0096 Sanders, Bruce, Carroll, Smith, all well known people from the period and add to the sense of class the film has.Overall this is an impressive and engaging film that tells a good story with a great approach, producing a dark and interesting film that is driven by an unseen character whether the tone is melodrama, romance or mystery story.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 6}, "heading": "A melodrama told in the dark shadow of fear and tension", "date": "2006-01-18T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1268739", "sentiment score": [0.0132, 0.0902, 0.4934, 0.3686, 0.0347]}, {"content": "Rebecca, I must say, is a masterpiece.

It's almost as if the studio suddenly noticed that the picture was going to run twenty minutes over its allocated slot, and ordered the final scenes to be cut to the bone and run together at breakneck speed. The result, for me, is a curiously unsatisfying finale; why go to the trouble of altering the original plot to ensure that Maxim's wife is in the house when it is set on fire, for example, and then cut the sequence so quickly that there is no real element of suspense whatsoever? It's a tragedy precisely because the film was potentially so good. I've seen stage adaptations of the same story, and they totally failed to catch the book's mingled atmosphere of sunlit happiness and suspense -- the taint of Rebecca reaching up from the past to destroy the innocence of the present. Right up until the moment when the heroine descends the staircase, however, this version is almost flawless; the comedy, the romance, the crippling social humiliations, the country-house interiors, the monstrous Mrs van Hopper, kind and tactless Beatrice, insinuating Jack Favell, aloof Maxim... and, of course, Joan Fontaine, who might have been made for the part. I had no mental image at all of what the book's heroine looked like -- but the moment I saw Miss Fontaine I knew she was absolutely right. Arguably she is too beautiful, almost distractingly so at times; but her style, her body language, the schoolgirl simplicity of her face, are all exactly fitting to the mood of Daphne du Maurier's unnamed narrator.My problems with the film start when it tries to become a thriller. Having retained the book's long build-up to the revelations, Hitchcock then suddenly seems to lose interest in their results: Maxim's fury and his wife's misery over the Caroline de Winter costume are barely glimpsed, and the nightmarish build-up of the book to the gallows, from this point on until the final revelations in London -- and their totally unexpected outcome -- is translated instead into a series of short sequences that convey little atmosphere beyond the bare mechanics of the plot. The scenes where the heroine is caught 'trespassing' in her predecessor's bedroom and breaks down are overwrought and unconvincing, one of the rare occasions where Joan Fontaine puts a foot wrong.However, the scenes during the inquest and in the inn afterwards -- as Favell's little blackmail attempt misfires -- are an example of effective adaptation, and the role-reversal scene between Maxim and his wife is both touching and poignant; she has paid for the newly-acquired strength to support him with the loss of the youth and freshness that first brought them together. From now on the marriage will stand or fall on the bond of mature affection they have managed to create. It is precisely because the film *can* succeed where it allows itself space that I find the cramped outcome so frustrating! A major problem for Hitchcock in moving to America was, of course, the Hollywood requirement to tone down the central plank of the plot: the fact that Maxim was genuinely guilty of Rebecca's murder. This weakens the whole 'confession' scene, since covering up an accidental death is scarcely a crime worthy of such moral agonising, and undermines the critical moment of revelation: instead of the simple and terrible \"I shot her, but she was still smiling\", we get \"I hit her, she looked almost pleased, I was about to hit her again, when she fell down through the open door and hit her head on some old ship's tackle which was lying around\". As a means of suicide, inciting your husband to punch you in the jaw seems less than encouraging...Oddly enough I was rather disappointed in Mrs Danvers, who didn't seem as sinister as I'd been expecting; she is polite and unenthusiastic, but doesn't betray the seething jealousy and ill-will the script ascribes to her. Since none of this is ever explicit, but only her unhappy mistress' perceptions, I suppose it's hard to convey -- and after all, if she were as openly witch-like and malicious as the girl sees her, other people would have noticed. I wasn't entirely won over by Laurence Olivier either, as he allows a slight air of boredom to creep in now and then -- the actor bored with the part, alas, rather than the character paralysed with ennui. By and large he is adequate to what is mainly a shuttered role; from time to time, as Maxim opens out, he is excellent, but I did get the impression on occasion that Olivier would rather have been doing something else.This is really a one-woman show, with all the other performers as supporting actors. Joan Fontaine deserved the Oscar for which she was at least nominated, and her portrayal of a gauche girl's growing maturity is the luminous centre of the film -- which makes it all the more unbalancing when the deliberate choice is made to strip her out of the plot at the end! The story has been all about her reactions, and the novel remains so: but in Hitchcock's finale we have the facts alone without any reaction at all -- Olivier underplaying as elsewhere -- and the unintended result is to rob vital sequences of their emotional depth.

Hitchcock emphasizes the love triangle between Maxim and his present and former wife very much, and after a while it almost seems repetitive. The movie takes small and very slow steps and very little new is introduced. Until we nears the end, when Maxim's story about the death of his first wife is put in question. Then we get to see the mystery and some of the suspense I think of when hearing the name Hitchcock. But its too late, by then I was already bored and had some of my attention elsewhere.Otherwise, a good production, very good acting from Joan Fontaine, and from Laurence Olivier with the distant character of Maxim. Unfortunately there are some mistakes done. Manderlay is obviously a miniature, and some of the background, mostly ocean, doesn't really connect with the actors. Supposed to be a classic, but I was a little disappointed.5/10", "rating": 5, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 18, "votes": 29}, "heading": "Long, slow, good acting but far too little \"Hitchcock\",", "date": "2005-11-20T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1220167", "sentiment score": [0.0116, 0.082, 0.3603, 0.5146, 0.0315]}, {"content": "It is strange that after arriving in Hollywood from Britain, Alfred Hitchcock should have chosen to base his first film upon a novel by Daphne du Maurier, the same author, who had provided him with the material for the last film of his British period. \"Jamaica Inn\" was one of his few failures, a minor-league costume drama that is today of little interest except to Hitchcock completists. With \"Rebecca\", however, he achieved one of his greatest successes, even though the story is hardly typical of his work.A number of Hitchcock's films, such as \"The 39 Steps\" or \"North by North-West\" end up with the hero and heroine falling in love, but are nevertheless essentially suspense films with an element of romance. \"Rebecca\", however, is essentially a romance with elements of suspense. Indeed, it starts out as a romantic comedy. A young woman (we never learn her name) staying on the French Riviera with her employer Mrs Van Hopper, meets and falls in love with Maxim de Winter, a handsome older widower. There is a brief comic sequence as the two lovers try to outwit the overbearing, bullying Mrs Van Hopper and escape back to England.With the shift in location to England, the mood of the film becomes darker and more serious. We learn that Maxim is the wealthy owner of Manderley, a stately home near the Cornish coast, and that he was widowed about a year earlier when his first wife Rebecca drowned in a boating accident. The new Mrs de Winter finds it difficult to adapt to her new role as the mistress of such a large house, especially as she feels that everyone, including the servants and Maxim's friends, is comparing her unfavourably with the beautiful and accomplished Rebecca. Maxim reveals to her that his first marriage was an unhappy one as Rebecca was compulsively promiscuous and betrayed him with a number of lovers. This revelation does not, however, put her mind at rest, because evidence soon comes to light that suggests that Maxim may have killed Rebecca out of jealousy.The \"suspense\" elements of the film only occur near the end, when Maxim has to struggle to clear himself from suspicion of murder. There are no typical Hitchcock set-pieces like the crop-duster in \"North by North-West\" or the shower scene in \"Psycho\". This is, however, one of the most atmospheric of Hitchcock's films. Although it was shot in California, the morning mists, the pine trees by the rocky coast and the Gothic mansion are all suggestive of England. (I suspect that if Hollywood were to make the film today they would try to Americanise it, but in the forties their attitude to British literature was generally more respectful).In a way this is a ghost story, although not in the literal sense of a tale of supernatural happenings. Manderley may not be literally haunted, but it is permeated by Rebecca's spirit. The old house is solid and luxurious, but it also has an oppressive air, especially for Mrs de Winter. (Max Ophuls was to conjure up a similar atmosphere in \"Caught\", made a few years later). Rebecca does not actually appear in the film; she does not appear in the book either, but that is a first-person narrative told from the viewpoint of her successor. In the film, where the first-person perspective is largely abandoned, it would have been much easier to show her in flashback, but Hitchcock chose to resist this temptation. In my view he was right to do so. Rebecca is far more frightening as an unseen but malevolent and brooding presence than she would be if seen in the flesh.Mrs de Winter is an outsider at Manderley, partly because she is from a less privileged social background than Maxim, partly because she is the only character who never knew Rebecca personally. Maxim was probably attracted to her precisely because she was so unlike Rebecca. As she is supposed to be somewhat plain and dowdy, Joan Fontaine, one of the most attractive actresses of the period, was perhaps not physically right for the role. (Joanna David, in the 1979 TV production, seemed closer to du Maurier's conception of the character). Nevertheless, Fontaine's interpretation of the role is a very good one, making her shy and bewildered but possessed of an inner strength which enables her love for Maxim to survive.Laurence Olivier is also good as Maxim, bringing out the two sides of his character. On the one hand he is the calm, self-possessed English gentleman, on the other a man haunted by his past. The other performance which stands out is that of Judith Anderson as the sinister housekeeper Mrs Danvers. Always dressed in black, with a severe hairstyle, moving silently through the house, Mrs Danvers initially greets the new Mrs de Winter with an icy formality, but gradually becomes her chief tormentor. Although this could not be explicitly stated in the forties, there is a strong hint that Mrs Danvers is a lesbian and that she might have been in love with Rebecca. Certainly, the scene in which she stands lasciviously pawing her late employer's underwear is highly suggestive.It certainly seemed eccentric of the Academy to give this film the \"Best Picture\" award while withholding \"Best Director\" from Hitchcock. 1940 was, however, a very strong year in the history of the cinema and, excellent film though \"Rebecca\" is, I am not sure that it is necessarily a greater one than John Ford's \"The Grapes of Wrath\", Chaplin's \"The Great Dictator\" or \"The Philadelphia Story\", all of which were nominated. I suspect that the decision to give \"Best Picture\" to \"Rebecca\" and \"Best Director\" to Ford may have been a deliberate attempt to spread the honours more evenly.

This film is often cited as a great example of how coherently he was able to weave all his skills. I agree, but only two are remarkable: Fontaine's performance in the first half where she shrinks in her new situation. And the use of the house. But the story is so dull and plodding it cripples the pleasure of a craftsmanlike film.The house is similar to many in other films. But already with this movie, Hitchcock has a camera that is curious. Hard to recognize how unusual that is today because such a stance is so common now, but the idea of having a camera come from non-human perspectives but with human behavior was unique to him.And he uses the building well. We get a hint of this in the opening sequence. There is a collection of absolutely dreadful shots of fog, and an equally dreadful narration by Fontaine, but then we are taken through the gates up the drive. In an ordinary film of the era, the gates would open or the camera would go through the space between the two halves.But this camera goes through a \"solid\" part of upper right gate. That effect was costly and we get the message early that this is about space.

I'm not generally a fan of classical romantic fiction, but Rebecca is most definitely an exception; not only does it have several great plot-twists but the central character is brilliantly conceived and entirely sympathetic, and the brooding Gothic atmosphere of both Manderley and Rebecca confine the drama within a tremendously chilling ghost story. The cast are all first-rate but both Fontaine and Anderson give career-defining performances.

This was the movie which allowed Hitchcock to paint on a really huge canvas, and he creates a powerful sense of dread - you can almost feel Rebecca's presence in the film. There's a stunning shot of Mrs Danvers opening some drapes, where he suddenly freezes the frame and dissolves to the next scene, epitomising the essence of the story - a place frozen in time, where nobody can move forward or shake themselves free of the past, and everything is stagnating.

Basically, on vacation in Monte Carlo, a self-conscious inexperienced young woman (Oscar nominated Joan Fontaine) meets aristocratic widower George Fortescue Maximilian \"Maxim\" de Winter (Oscar nominated Lord Sir Laurence Olivier). She works as a lady's companion to Mrs. Van Hopper (Florence Bates), and the two spend a good deal of time together, leading to love and marriage. Maxim takes his new bride back to Manderley, his grand mansion by the sea in south-western England. The housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers (Oscar nominated Judith Anderson), is domineering and cold, and is obsessed with the memory of the first Mrs. De Winter, the eponymous Rebecca. Mrs. Danvers has preserved Rebecca's former grand bedroom and continues to display various items that carry her monogram (the letter \"R\"). The new Mrs. De Winter is overwhelmed and intimidated by the huge house and her newfound responsibilities. But more than anything the spiritual presence of Rebecca causes Mrs. De Winter to believe that Maxim is still in love with his first wife, which could explain his occasional outbursts of anger. It is only later, talking to others, Mrs. De Winter discovers what happened to Rebecca; she died out at sea after her vessel capsized, and her body was washed ashore a few months later. There is also the appearance of Rebecca's sleazy cousin Jack Favell (George Sanders) when Maxim is away. Wanting to please her husband, Mrs. De Winter suggests holding a costume party as he and Rebecca used to. Mrs. Danvers advises her to copy the dress worn by a young woman in one of the portraits displayed on the staircase, which she implies is one of Maxim's ancestors. But, when Mrs. De Winter comes down the staircase wearing the costume, Maxim is appalled as Rebecca wore an identical dress at her last ball, just before her death. He angrily orders her to remove the dress, and she runs upstairs in tears. Mrs. De Winter confronts Danvers about this, but Danvers tells her she can never take Rebecca's place. Feeling helpless and disturbed, Mrs. Danvers almost persuades her to jump to her death from the second story window in Rebecca's room. At that moment, however, the alarm is raised because a sunken boat has been discovered. Rebecca's body has been identified aboard the boat, and suspicions start to circulate, as Maxim identified her body previously. Maxim now confesses to his new wife that he misidentified another body as Rebecca's in order to conceal the truth. He hated Rebecca and the marriage had been a sham from the start. Rebecca told Maxim she intended to continue the promiscuous and perverse life she had led before they were married but pretended to be the perfect wife and hostess for the sake of appearances. Rebecca had an ongoing affair with her cousin Jack Favell, and one night she told Maxim that she was pregnant with Favell's child. During a heated argument, she fell, struck her head, and died. To conceal the truth, Maxim took the body out in a boat, which he then scuttled and identified another body as Rebecca's. The crisis causes the second Mrs. De Winter to shed her na\u00efve ways as they both plan how to prove Maxim's innocence. Favell attempts to blackmail Maxim by threatening to reveal that she had never been suicidal, which is suggested by the police. When Maxim goes to the police, they suspect him of murder. However, further investigation reveals that Rebecca was not pregnant but terminally ill with an incurable cancer, and may have had only weeks to live, so the suicide verdict stands. Maxim realises that Rebecca had been trying to goad him into killing her via indirect suicide so that Maxim would be ruined. Maxim is freed and returns home. But returning to Manderley, the mansion is on fire, set ablaze by the deranged Mrs. Danvers. Mrs. De Winter and all the staff escape the fire, except Danvers, who dies when the ceiling collapses on her. Also starring Nigel Bruce as Major Giles Lacy, Reginald Denny as Frank Crawley, C. Aubrey Smith as Colonel Julyan, Gladys Cooper as Beatrice Lacy, Leo G. Carroll as Dr. Baker, and Hitchcock's cameo is as a man with his back turned to the audience walking past Sanders talking to a police officer after a phone call. Fontaine is highly convincing as the constantly nervous as the working-class woman thrown fast into marriage and the high life, Olivier does very well as the husband haunted by his past, and Anderson is highly memorable as the evil housekeeper with a sinister obsession (there is a possible lesbian subtext) with the dead wife of the title. It is a film of two halves, the first about the new wife trying and failing to fit in, and the second the truth about the first wife's death being exposed, it has terrific camerawork and a splendid score that adds to the eerie atmosphere, and it is engaging, an interesting classic romantic psychological thriller.

In some respects it is easy to see why: the film is very much a lavish Hollywood romance; the nature of the story offers little room for the director's legendary talents; and censorship issues of the day effectively prevented the film from touching upon the most startling plot twist of the original novel. Worse still, Hitchcock found himself strangled by producer David O. Selznick, who was legendary for control-freak attitude. And yet, in spite of all these problems--and in spite of Hitchcock's own feelings about the film itself--REBECCA remains one of Hitchcock's most praised and widely admired films, and with good reason.The film is perhaps Hitchcock's single finest exercise in pure atmosphere. Every frame manages to convey a combination of misty romance and increasing emotional disquiet, and the look feeds beautifully into the famous story of a mousy second wife who becomes increasingly insecure about her wealthy husband's seemingly perfect and mysteriously dead first wife, Rebecca. The script is remarkably strong, and the cast, with Dame Judith Anderson offering a truly legendary performance as Mrs. Danvers, is particularly fine. Everything about the film is dreamy, slickly produced, and expertly executed, and even the most jaded viewer will likely be drawn into the film's quietly mounting sense of insecurity and paranoia.If this film had been made by any one except Hitchcock, I would have given it a full ten stars--but Hitchcock would quickly break Selznick's control and he would go on to make a host of still greater films, often working without a producer of any kind at all.

There are a few other moments of atmospheric success, and Fontaine's initial arrival and exploration of Manderlay and its characters is interesting, but otherwise, the film is often mediocre, and sometimes even poor. Laurence Olivier is very stale and does not exude much of a presence, nor a riveting sense of charm. Fontaine is better, but her character is completely over-the-top. She seems well adjusted and interesting at first, then does nothing but shake and stand with lost eyes for the rest of the film. I know the situation is supposed to bring about such behavior, but it is just too much. The chemistry between the two characters is horrible. Perhaps that is supposed to demonstrate the awkwardness in their relationship. But, then we find de Winter really does love her, and he hates his dead wife. So while his madness translates well, his supposed love for her never does. Not even at the end. And hers for him feels impossible to get our heads around, since he never does anything but be rich and handsome to impress her. I know, I know, those are the dynamics of the relationship, and some of them are more subtle (e.g. de Winter probably goes for her because she seems sexually tame and timidly obsequious), but it still does not feel right in the end. The characters' actions are too shortsighted for the overall plot.The film often has no momentum, and drags on forever. The entire opening courtship can be eliminated since it is not efficacious in convincing us of much romance anyway. Then there is the second part, where Fontaine slowly learns the secrets of Manderlay, and though this probably is the best part of the film, it still never feels like it is building to a climax, even though every scene attempts to convey a bit of foreboding intrigue. Instead, it becomes monotonous; precisely because every scene is exactly the same. The end feels like it should approach soon after Danvers diabolical rant. Then there is Olivier's admission, and it feels like it should come again. But again it doesn't, and when the ending finally does come, it is of such an enormous magnitude that it feels too brief.Then there is the story, which I believe has a couple of plot holes, and realistic dilemmas, though I cannot say with absolute certainty.

This is exactly what atmospheric is supposed to be about, and in black and white, it shines. This is also what Gothic horror is in essence, and many have imitated yet come up short, most notably M. Night Shyamalan who, in trying to go for a shock twist and purported \"atmosphere\" only creates a bad aftertaste and a hangover the size of Mount Everest. This is, essentially, Hitchcock's first true masterpiece.Not one performance rings false, not to the novel or to their respective interpretations. Lawrence Olivier, quite possibly one of the greatest actors that ever lived, portrays a broken man who still lives haunted by the past as he himself were still living in that unending hell. Judith Anderson embodies one of the most coldly sadistic figures in cinema history, her smooth and elegant truculence only exceeded by Anthony Hopkins' rendition of Dr. Hannibal Lecter. One can't seem to understand the way she wallows in her dead mistresses' clearly perverse nature, but that exactly she does, right down to her own end. George Sanders does what he does best: sneer, smirk, and spit line after line of practiced venom, and would be honored 10 years later in ALL ABOUT EVE. Gladys Cooper, still striking in her 50s, plays into her casual cattiness which means no harm, although her rendition of Beatrice Lacy is a little subdued from the novel's version.And then there is Joan Fontaine. Not one of the best actresses on film, yet here, playing a role that evolves beautifully from a frightened, weak girl who is put into a situation she does not understand and who turns right at the point of losing it into a much more mature, strong woman capable of holding her own, she carries the weight of the entire drama and comes forth with flying colors. While I would have preferred Anne Baxter who would have been the exact right age for this role, Fontaine exudes so much restraint and nervousness about her character (partially to blame Olivier's treatment of her and Hitchcock's telling her the entire cast hated her), it's almost a relief when she finally decides to confront Olivier about what it the secret of Manderley. Not many roles require such a change and not many actresses would sink her teeth into a part that requires being put-upon until she can't stand no more, and this is one beautiful performance.A movie that should have won more Oscars that year, REBECCA has since grown in stature and proved that a film need not trophies to be Timeless and Great.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 140, "votes": 168}, "heading": "What Atmospheric Gothic-horror Should Be.", "date": "2005-03-05T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1033586", "sentiment score": [0.0101, 0.0264, 0.0665, 0.4458, 0.4512]}, {"content": "What other word can describe such a piece of art?

She's also absolutely perfect in the role of the second Mrs. DeWinter, taking a character that could have become a cloying bore in less capable hands and transforming her into a sympathetic and interesting figure.The movie, on the whole, is similarly amazing, capturing the spirit and the tone of those great Gothic romances. Watching Rebecca, I was reminded (pleasantly) of Wuthering Heights; I do not mean to suggest that in some way this film re-tells the tale of Cathy and Heathcliff, but rather that Rebecca has the feel of Bronte's novel (I am most certainly not talking about the William Wyler adaptation a few years before the release of Rebecca. That's a terrible film that somehow manages to mis-interpret the novel).I must assume that the guiding hand of Hitchcock played no small role in recreating the feel of a Gothic romance. There are very few that would be able to take a love story, infuse it with such gloom, with such a sense of foreboding, and still manage to create something that ends happily without it feeling like a cop-out. I'd also like to draw everyone's attention to the incredibly moving section of the film that occurs between the arrival of the second Mrs. DeWinter at Mandalay and the masqued ball. The emotional strain on the Joan Fontaine character is so palpable, so absolutely taxing, that it actually pains me to watch. I hurt along with her.

This isn't the twists of modern movies, where you're immediately awe-struck by the sheer unlikeliness of them, but rather twists that send a chill down your spine and turn the movie in a direction you wouldn't have imagined possible. There is almost more suspense and tension in the entire last *half hour* than there is in the collective amount of supposedly suspenseful films of newer time. This is thriller, as it's supposed to be. Don't give us the husband-suddenly-turned-psychotic out to kill his wife, keep the face-less killer devoid of any real motive away, and please spare us the old clich\u00e9 of the psychopath who rarely ever has a reason for his/her behavior. This is what a thriller is supposed to be like. Constantly hinting at something, hidden in the past, keep us guessing what it is, and just when we think we've figured everything out, pull the carpet out from under our feet. The one complaint I could come up with for this film is that the first half doesn't accomplish much, apart from build-up and character development, but, the more I think about it, the more I realize that that's what makes the impact of the second half; we *think* we know these people, these secretive and hidden people, we think we've figured out what they're hiding, why they are so secretive, and then we hear how different the truth is from what we had expected, and it is devastating, in a good way. To use a metaphor: Just the moment you're sure you've put together the puzzle, someone points out that you've missed a fourth of it, or, rather, points out that the picture is, while it seems logical at its current state, far from the real picture. The plot is excellent, and the way it slowly unravels is perfect. It keeps you guessing and watching, patiently and attentive, and once you're treated to the mind-blowing final half hour, full of twists, tension and suspense, you will not feel that you have wasted the time up to that point; quite the opposite, actually. The film has a very good pace, and is thoroughly interesting. The acting is great; Laurence Olivier as the mystical yet charming Maxim de Winter, Joan Fontaine as the nameless heroine who is humble and submissive, George Sanders as the sleazy, creepy Jack Favell and Judith Anderson as the cold character of Mrs. Danver, who is seemingly devoid of emotion. The characters are well-written and credible. The cinematography is defining of Hitchcock, with plenty of play on shadows and long, lingering pans that only increase the chill down your spine. The dialog is well-written and surprisingly sharp. The whole thing is just amazing as a film. Defining of Hitchcock and worth watching for any competent film viewer. One final note; the last few scenes involve so many twists, so much suspense and tension, that it puts just about every single other non-Hitchcock thriller to shame. I recommend it to any major fan of film in general, as most should find something enjoyable about it, any fan of Hitchcock, and big fans of the following genres: thriller, mystery, drama and romance.

Rebecca, though never seen, is clearly the central character, but we learn about her all through indirection in the dialogue of the other characters. We are allowed to create her piece by piece in our own minds, which just adds to the engrossing, I-can't-stop-watching, thrust of the movie.The character who actually tells us the most about the real Rebecca is Mrs. Danvers. The erotic attachment of this character to Rebecca is subtle, yet unmistakable. The wonderful scene in which Judith Anderson shows Rebecca's bedroom to Joan Fontaine is breathtaking in its suggestiveness. The West Wing, 'the only room that looks down across the lawn to the sea' has become Mrs. Danvers' private temple to Rebecca. Her loving preservation of Rebecca's possessions, her sensual handling of Rebecca's underclothes, of her diaphanous negligee, of her glamorous furs and then Anderson's almost hypnotic miming of brushing Rebecca's hair as Fontaine sits at Rebecca's dressing table all make this scene an unforgettable sequence. Anderson's acting is absolutely miraculous. She achieves her character with hardly ever a change in her affect, except where a very slight contrasting up tick in energy transforms her in the West Wing scene and in the scene where she coolly suggests that Fontaine leave-by means of a precipitous drop out of the window onto the rocks. It is a performance which I doubt could ever be duplicated.As we later learn of Rebecca's moral character, it also seems that Mrs. Danvers was as much in love with Rebecca's corruption as she was with the woman herself. 'Danny' in a way becomes the embodiment of Rebecca's cold malevolence which still lingers in the mansion.Joan Fontaine could hardly have been better. She, of all the characters, evolves through the movie. She moves in a seamless line from the pitiful, beleaguered companion of Mrs. Van Hopper to her drowned rat arrival at Manderley to the self-assured and supportive wife Maxim wanted and needed. What I found fascinating about this transformation is the imaginative skill of the costume designer. At the beginning, Fontaine's shy little character is dressed like she made terrible selections at a Macy's basement sale. Later as she tries to fill the role of the 'great lady' she believed Rebecca to have been, her clothes always appear too big and totally out of character. Note the black evening dress with the absurdly large flowers across the front and especially the overwhelmingly outsized Garden Party gown she tries to wear to the costume ball. After she learns the truth about Rebecca from Maxim, discovering that he actually loves her as much as he hated Rebecca, Fontaine's costumes become trim, conservative and tasteful, befitting the genuine, grown-up woman she has become.Fittingly, the final scene belongs to Anderson-the frustrated woman robbed of her goddess--who brings the movie to a thundering operatic finish. Although Selznick and Hitchcock repeatedly clashed over this move, it remains a deathless tribute to both men. This movie never loses its fascination and bears repeated watching, each time weaving its wonderful spell anew.

Hitchcock subsequently used her in 'Suspicion' with Cary Grant. She was also excellent in that but 'Rebecca' is a much stronger movie. The supporting cast also includes some brilliant performances, especially Judith Anderson ('Laura') as the extremely creepy Mrs. Danvers, George Sanders who plays Rebecca's slimy cousin, and Nigel Bruce in a typical role as de Winter's bumbling brother-in-law Major Lacy. Sanders subsequently worked again with Hitchcock in 'Foreign Correspondent', and Bruce played Cary Grant's lovable pal \"Beaky\" in 'Suspicion'. I sometimes think that Hitchcock's 1940s movies are overlooked by many because they are regarded as being too \"old fashioned\", but for me movies like 'Suspicion', 'Saboteur', 'Lifeboat' and 'Spellbound' are some of the most entertaining movies Hitchcock ever made, and 'Rebecca' is the best of the lot.

The setting is brilliant, and the scene where you see Maxim distantly solitarly on the precipice is breathtaking. Well done, Hitchcock!

There is so much talent on show from the classiest writer on the block to the best director of all time and probably the best actor of all time. It also features the classiest producer of all time, but there wasn't room for it in the sentence. Talk about a power packed movie - how could it fail? Nor did it.I am not a big fan of Gothic novels. For me they are one step above the silly, but I find they make far better films, the silliness tends to look better on the silver screen. This is a simple story. A man with a secret and girl that has to come to terms with a character that is already dead. This is where the men are separated from the boys (if you can forgive the sex change) in the literary world. Threat for the majority of writers would come from the living, only geniuses can makes the dead seem just as potent. The setting of the castle on the hill is chilling. I don't know about American's or non Europeans, but they are by their nature unnatural and sinister places. If you actually visited one for real, you would find them to be like any other home only built more sturdily. However they look terrible from the outside, in the manner of prisons. Yes there are short comings here. There is so little romance before the couple marry that it almost seems like a scene or two has been cut out. Equally many of the devices are stock and not that original: Castle, cliff top, crashing waves, the giant painting, sudden appearances out of shadows, strange people turning up out of the blue. All found under the chapter \"Disorientation\" in the writer's manual. Hitchcock was the best thriller director ever. He virtually invented the film thriller and I bet people watching today think that some of his films are full of clich\u00e9s without realising that he was the one that invented the clich\u00e9s! He knew film backwards. He knew his audience backwards. He was like a master magician: Knew all the tricks and knew how to perform them all. Only age withered him.Olivier is a strange fish on film. Started terrible, worked his way up to genius level and then slipped back to the ham. Here is trying to be older than his actual years and is not totally convincing. He is playing dour and that doesn't totally suit him. He is better with some kind of humorous undercurrent. Ronald Coleman (who turned down the part) would have been better. Indeed Larry seems to be doing an impression of him throughout.I don't rate the original novel as much as others. It has too many stock situations and too many audience pleasing motives (person growing to overcome difficult situations) to get that high marks. Call it upmarket airport pulp.The thing I like about the product is that it is not really moral in any true sense of the word. It doesn't tie up it itself up with a pink ribbon and has plenty of ambiguity. However ambiguity is not something to sniffed at.

As with Daphne DuMaurier's novel, so begins Alfred Hitchcock's classic film adaptation, and the only one of his films to be awarded an Academy Award for Best Picture. It should also be noted that the film also won an Oscar for Best Cinematography, Black and White. Hitchcock, Fontaine, Olivier, and Anderson were also nominated in their respective categories.Rebecca was Alfred Hitchcock's first American movie, and much has been written about the interference by David O. Selznick with its production. That is not the purpose of this review, though. Frankly, I don't know all that much about what went on behind the scenes, but I do know that the resulting film is a masterpiece.Rebecca can be divided into three parts: Monte Carlo, Manderly, and the inquest after the discovery of Rebecca' sunken boat.At Monte Carlo, we are introduced to Joan Fontaine's character, a complete nonentity (in fact, we never learn her real name) who is serving as a paid companion to Mrs. Van Hopper, an obnoxious, wealthy matron delightfully played by Florence Bates. While there, she meets George Fortescu Maximillian de Winter (Maxim for short,played by Laurence Olivier), fabulously wealthy and as charming as Mrs. Van Hopper is boorish. Maxim has been traveling trying to recover from his first wife Rebecca's untimely death in a drowning accident. At the end of her stay at Monte Carlo, the young woman is surprised to have Maxim ask her to marry him, although not with as much romance as she would probably have liked, and much to the consternation of her erstwhile employer Mrs. Van Hopper.The movie then takes us to Manderly, the palatial family estate of the de Winter family. Here Fontaine's character truly finds herself out of her depth as the new mistress of Manderly. Not only has she never had to deal with such a large house and a retinue of servants, but she gets a decidedly chilly reception from Mrs. Danvers (Judith Anderson), and everywhere she goes and everyone with whom she speaks reminds her of the beauty and accomplishments of Rebecca. She feels overwhelmed by the specter of Maxim's first wife and of his abiding love for her. Not only that, but Fontaine's character is treated like a child, both in Monte Carlo and at Manderly, whether it is in the dismissive way of Mrs. Van Hopper, the fatherly manner of Maxim, or in the gently patronizing way of Frith, Manderly's head butler. One gets the feeling that the new Mrs. de Winter is a child lost in this great house, afraid of making any false steps.Judith Anderson is amazing as Mrs. Danvers. Although she never raises her voice, and always speaks with seeming respect to her new mistress, Anderson nonetheless allows Mrs. Danver's malevolence to come through. She is the archetype for all the cold-hearted housekeepers who have come since, and none can match her. She never lets Mrs. de Winter forget Rebecca and how she was loved by everyone, especially Maxim. Haunted by the specter of Rebecca, the new Mrs. de Winter seems to feel like an intruder, trespassing on Rebecca's home and sleeping in her bed.Mrs. Danvers finally reveals the depth of her hatred by suggesting a costume for Mrs. de Winter to wear at a party that was originally worn by Rebecca. After Maxim's expected negative reaction, Mrs. Danvers urges her, in arguably the most memorable scene in the movie, to commit suicide by throwing herself from the window. Mrs. de Winter is saved, though, by the wreck of a boat near Manderly and the noise of the rescue that is undertaken.During the course of the rescue, another boat is found: the one in which Rebecca died. Having discovered Rebecca's corpse inside, it is announced that an inquest must take place to investigate her death. When his wife tries to comfort Maxim, he reveals to her the truth behind his relationship with Rebecca: that he hated her, and was trapped by her into a sham of a marriage. He also tells her of how Rebecca died; that he had killed her in a rage and sunk the boat with her body inside. After this revelation, a change comes over the new Mrs. de Winter: she grows up, and is visibly more self-assured. She and Maxim, to a certain extent, reverse roles, in that he loses hope and she must comfort him and reassure him that all will be well, when in fact all seems hopeless. She is now truly the mistress of Manderly.During the inquest, it is discovered that Rebecca's boat was scuttled, and had not capsized as was previously thought. Circumstantial evidence begins to pile up against Maxim, until a visit to Rebecca's personal physician reveals her ultimate betrayal and clears Maxim's name.Rebecca is, essentially, a drama of mystery and romance, and in lesser hands it could easily fall into the trap of melodrama. But Hitchcock's deft direction, the superb cinematography, and the outstanding performances by the entire cast make it one of the greatest romances ever made, and one of my favorite films.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 13, "votes": 19}, "heading": "My favorite Hitch", "date": "2003-08-13T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0022640", "sentiment score": [0.0891, 0.3129, 0.3629, 0.1998, 0.0352]}, {"content": "I finally saw this film for the first time today, and I feel it was as good as everyone made it out to be.

For me is was an opportunity to see Laurence Olivier as 'Maxim' de Winter and Joan Fontaine as the \"new\" Mrs de Winter who has no first name, two great actors that I knew virtually nothing of. The first Mrs had died about a year before this film begins, in southern France, where the young lady sees Max on the edge of a cliff apparently thinking of jumping, and we don't know why.some SPOILERS follow, read further at your own risk, because these are comments for my recollection.In Monte Carlo Max courts the young (early 20s)woman quickly, asks her to stay and marry him rather than go to New York with the old woman she assists. She does, is taken home to Manderly which is his home, a large mansion/castle with servants. (The film Gosford Park is good to help understand the service structure involved here.) She is young, timid, and at a loss for how to be \"Mrs de Winter\" in this setting.She gradually learns about the deceased Mrs and finds that in most respects she was not very well liked. As it turns out Max had found out she was having an affair with her cousin, thought she was pregnant with her cousin's child, and instead of living with the knowledge that his fortune would be inherited by a bastard child, he killed her and sank her in her boat, identifying a different found body as his wife's. The new Mrs de Winter was much more what he had in mind for a companion.Things take a twist when the sunken boat is found, and containing the real deceased Mrs. An inquest reveals she was not pregnant, but was dying from cancer, which gave her a motive for the suicide that Max claimed. Max is off the hook, but he had told his new Mrs the truth and that would be theirs.Good, engrossing movie, but for my tastes don't see why it gets such great respect as a classic.

Given Selznick's exquisite taste, and the way the movie came out, his instincts were probably correct.The movie contains a secret, and here it departs considerably from the novel. I won't give it away, yet it's worth mentioning that the movie takes a turn toward the end that's such so astounding and unexpected that it actually works, making the picture surprisingly satisfying almost in spite of itself.

Surprisingly, it's the only Hitchcock movie ever to win an Oscar and a truly cinema classic, besides one of his best movies from the Selznick period (the other being the amazing \"Notorius\"; but I digress again).Ok, I'll focus in the movie. It tells the story of an un-named heroine, shy and innocent, who marries the tormented mr. De Winter, a rich fellow tormented by the memory of his dead wife, Rebecca. When the new couple arrives to the castle that De Winter owns, the girl finds herself oppressed by the constant reminders of the dead mrs. De Winter and frightened by an evil maid. The story is waaaaaaay too twisted when the crime angle appears, and it appears quite late, so don't expect a masterfully executed plot. But the truly amazing aspect is the psychological situation of this girl who is doomed to fail in comparison with Rebecca (who later on the movie reveals to have been a femme fatale who kept cheating on mr. De Winter) and in the beautiful direction style. And of course, a special mention to the astronomical dumbness of the Hollywood censors, who couldn't spot a tacit but obvious lesbian character, mrs. Danvers the maid.The actors couldn't be better chosen, specially Joan Fontaine who is truly admirable and an astounding beauty. Laurence Olivier is also great and the cast in general, exclusively british -although, like I said before, it's an american production-, is amazing.So, I can highly recommend this film to those who want to see one of Hitchcock's earlier gems.

The film has already garnered so many comments that I'll avoid repeating most of them. The plot I'm sure has been thoroughly outlined and professionally analyzed but a few points are worth emphasis.The plot of very precisely structured. It consists basically of a man who is the dream of many women in the 1940s audience: ruggedly handsome, intelligent, keen witted, a bit commanding but not too much, fabulously wealthy, a touch roguish, and mysterious. It's the mystery that provides the plot engine. Every incident of his past emotional life needs to be pried out of Maxim deWinter (what a name, suggesting frigidity and distance) as if it were an abcessed tooth. Each secret, as he reveals it, is a surprise to his wife. Except for the final secret uncovered in the plot, which surprises everybody. Maxim could clear the whole mystery up with an hour's worth of private conversation with his wife. But of course he doesn't, or else there would be no story. That's why Hamlet takes so long to slaughter Claudius. And why the Indians don't shoot the horses as they're chasing the stagecoach.The acting. Olivier is extremely good at impersonating deWinter with all his charm and challenge. George Sanders is the best cad that the movies ever produced, and he proves it again here. Mrs. Danvers has a face and an expression that looks like an ice sculpture. The implicit lesbianism in her character of course had to remain implicit, but it is still rather a shock when she tenderly unfolds Mrs. DeWinter's nightie and says smoothly, \"Look, you can see my hand through it.\" As for Joan Fontaine, a friend in Ireland said of her performance, \"She does the shivering wife very well.\" Precisely put. With her delicate bone structure, fragile looking limbs, and her overall ikabani flower arrangement appearance, her wide asymmetrical eyes, with one brow arching up over her pale forehead, she looks about to faint with fright through half the movie. The only thing coarse about her is her wardrobe: bulky knit sweaters over her girlish bosom, long flapping drab skirts over her small but saucy rump, and those clodhoppers she wears while clunking about the house. She does the shivering naif in at least two other films of the period -- Hitchcock's \"Suspicion\" and \"Jane Eyre.\" In fact, rummaging through the disarranged attic that is my long-term memory, I can't really remember her \"doing\" any other role.It's the closest Hitchcock ever came to making what was then called \"a woman's picture.\" It received a \"best picture\" Oscar, which went to Selznick.

It has that typical shapelessness of a movie based on a novel. There are unintentionally comical inconsistencies. Olivier is a closed book throughout the movie, yet in the end - for no reason at all - he becomes loquacity itself, spelling everything out to the last detail with an almost effeminate luxuriance. He is too generic to be really interesting though. The most interesting characters are that Mrs. Yaketyyack at the beginning, and the weird housekeeper, whose evil seems to reside in her not being wealthy, young or beautiful. More idiosyncrasies should have been crammed into the movie to make it at least interestingly anecdotal - and I don't mean Sanders eating a chicken leg. The humor potential is not exploited. There is humor in everything. Humor is not an option, it's a fact.

Selznick. Selznick did the right thing in bringing Hitchcock to direct the film and in doing so, turned it into a classic. Hitchcock is a genius and throughly deserved an Oscar. Laurence Olivier plays the rich English owner of Manderly, Maxim De Winter. Olivier gives a fine and tortured performance of a man who is haunted by his dead wife, Rebecca. His performance was great but the only flaw is that his character is annoyingly unresponsive to his wife. Judith Anderson gives a chilling performance as Mrs. Danvers, the crazed housekeeper with a lunatic obsession to her dead mistress, Rebecca. Her lines are classic and it is she who gives the tense atmosphere to the movie-Hitchcock's dark and cold Manderly just enhanced Miss Anderson's performance. It is Joan Fontaine who really gave the stellar performance as the second Mrs. De Winter. She is a shy girl who suddenly marries the haunted Maxim of a great estate. Hitchcock originially wanted Fontaine's sister, Olivia De Havilland to play the part. Olivier wanted his wife, Vivien Leigh. Although both ladies are great actresses, I'm glad that Fontaine was cast because she made Rebecca what it is today. This was the movie that sprung Fontaine to stardom and her shyness of the camera was carefully inputed into the character of the lonely Mrs. De Winter. Her first words: \"Last night I dreamt we went to Manderly again\" sets context not only to the story but to the character of Mrs. De Winter. She is shy, unused to a formal life, desperate for Maxim's love and most of all, intimidated by the presence of the late Rebecca in Manderly. Mrs. De Winter was supposed to be a plain and mousy person and so, Fontaine had the misfortune of being a beautiful woman playing an unattractive one. However, Fontaine presents other ways of being unattractive--such as that Mrs. De Winter has absolutely no social skills. All in all, Fontaine gave a performance that deserved a Best Actress Oscar.

With a masterful hand, Hitchcock delicately brings his camera around and around and peeks in the shadows, bringing threat from every corner of the mansion. I don't think the acting is average. Olivier is at his best, again, as in Wuthering Heights, standing above his ghosts. If there is a weakness, it's not in the film, but in the book. What are Olivier's motive sin marrying the girl if he was to resign her to the coldness of her new environment. How clueless was he about the hatred directed toward his young wife. Was he totally unaware that Rebecca could hold forth even in her death? Still, even though Sir Alfred didn't really like doing this film and probably butted heads with his producer, it is a work of incredible craftsmanship and when it is over, it makes one feel the great loss. Like \"The Fall of the House of Usher,\" the cracks in the foundation are what this story is all about.

Selznik and Director Alfred Hitchcock. Olivier is one of those rare actors, like Marlon Brando and Richard Burton, who was both a great actor and a great star. We're so used to seeing him as an old man, it's a treat to seem him young, dashing, and unbelievably sexy. Joan Fontaine is marvelous as the mousy, fearful young lady who becomes the second Mrs De Winter, who can't believe that a man like Maxim DeWinter (Olivier) would even look at her, let alone fall in love with her. Gradually she comes into her own, finding courage, warmth and the strength of her personality. The rest of the cast is a veritable who's who of fine British actors: Melville Cooper, Sir Aubrey Smith, Leo G. Carroll, Reginald Denny - but Dame Judith Anderson (whose Lady MacBeth and Medea would set the standard for those great characters in literature against which all actresses who attempt them must be judged) almost walks away with the show as the psychotic, despicable house mistress, Mrs Danvers whose obsession with the late Rebecca (the first Mrs. DeWinter), borders on the perverse. George Saunders, oozing hair oil from every pore, is deliciously slimy as the villain, a scoundrel without conscience or integrity, who kisses and tells and subjects Maxim De Winter to loathsome blackmail. (Zsa Zsa Gabor, one his wives, said that he was so vain that he was the only person she ever met who spent more time in front of a mirror than she did!) This film was made in the glory days of Hollywood when producers and directors knew instinctively that it was the story that tells the story. Running 130 minutes, quite long by 1940's standards, it zips along at a rapid pace, and Hitch, as always, keeps us guessing on the edge of our chairs.

Fontaine was enchanting as the new Mrs. de Winters. Its been mentioned, but Judith Anderson as Mrs. Danvers does add a sense of dread and intrigue into the mix, and was memorable and excellent as well. The first hour of the movie I was quite interested. I found myself becoming intrigued as to what happened to the original Mrs. de Winters, and really what the big secret was with Maxim de Winters. I felt a sense of tension, and I was rather intrigued. That, of course was the first half of the movie.Then comes the second half, when we are exposed to the big secret. And let me tell you, I was not impressed. The movie, in my humble opinion, quickly changes tone. It loses its identity as a psychological thriller and becomes something less. The romance between Fontaine and Olivier quickly becomes unbelievable, as we are supposed to believe that she would still love a man such as him.(you'll see what I mean when you watch it) It loses the sense of tension and intrigue that fueled it beautifully for the first half, and comes to a screeching halt. I lost interest at that point, and by the grand finale, which I was also ill impressed with, I just didn't care anymore.I should note that I personally don't like plot twists. The most important aspect of any film, for myself, is the story. When something happens that I don't like, it weakens everything else. Its a shame here because the performances were top notch. The romance was a bit stale, nothing compared to the beauty that was 'Notorious'. This is probably the worst I've seen of Hitchcock, but luckily he gets much better than this.

It richly deserved the Oscar it received, but it's a real puzzle that the Academy saw fit to withhold a best director award for Hitch. Would one possibly give an award to a work by Picasso and not to Picasso himself?\"Rebecca\" was the first of the director's American-made films, and it shows. It's quite different from his earlier British-made films, such as \"Young and Innocent\" and even \"The Lady Vanishes,\" which somehow seem more amateurish by comparison. (I know little of the British cinema of that era, but it's difficult not to conclude that Hollywood was better at producing more sophisticated efforts.) I would even judge \"Rebecca\" the best of his films of the early 1940s, with the possible exception of \"Shadow of a Doubt.\" It is true, of course, that much of this film has become clich\u00e9 (remember the spoofs on the old \"Carol Burnette Show\"!), but it still weathers the decades very well. The acting is uniformly excellent. Olivier is the hardened Maxim de Winter, untitled lord of Manderly, trying to forget the past and given to unexpected bouts of anger and coldheartedness. Fontaine is perfect as the unnamed mousy heroine, innocent yet deeply in love, still carrying with her the aura of an awkward schoolgirl. Even character actor Nigel Bruce, best known for his role in the Sherlock Holmes films, makes an appearance and plays, in effect, Nigel Bruce!But it is Judith Anderson's role as Mrs. Danvers that viewers are likely to remember best. Her presence is as dark and foreboding as that of the deceased Rebecca herself, and Fontaine is evidently cowed by her icy stare and unnervingly formal manner. The dynamics between the two actresses are wonderful. Who could fail to empathize with Fontaine's unenviable position as, in effect, the new employer of such an intimidating personage? On the other hand, Olivier seems quite unfearful of Anderson, despite her representing so much of the past he is trying to block out. This part of the plot (even in the book) never made much sense to me and is unconvincing.As far as I know, this film marked Hitch's first collaboration with composer Franz Waxman, whose haunting score makes it all the more memorable. Waxman's scores are perhaps less obviously cinematic than those of the incomparable Bernard Herrmann, who would score Hitch's films from 1955 to 1966. Contrast the score for \"Rebecca\" to Herrmann's music for \"Citizen Kane\" the following year, and you'll immediately hear the difference. Waxman's is more symphonic in the central European style reflective of his own birth and upbringing. Yet it is worth recalling that scoring films was still a new art at this time, and both Waxman and Herrmann were pioneers.Finally, one has to mention the cinematography, which is magnificent. Technically \"Rebecca\" might have been filmed in colour, which was newly available in 1940. (\"Gone with the Wind\" was filmed entirely in colour the previous year, while \"The Wizzard of Oz\" and \"The Women\" had colour scenes.) But colour would have diminished its impact. The suspense and the ominous sense of impending doom could only have been communicated through the medium of black-and-white and the deft use of light and shade which it affords.In one respect, of course, \"Rebecca\" is not a typical Hitchcock film. There is no fleeing innocent trying to clear his name of a crime he did not commit. Surprisingly, there isn't even a murder, although its absence was apparently imposed by the Hayes Code and is certainly foreign to Daphne du Maurier's original novel. Some have said that there is more Selznick than Hitchcock in this film, and perhaps there's something to that. Still, if the collaborative effort between the two was not exactly amiable, it was nevertheless successful.In short, this is the first in a string of Hitchcock masterpieces.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 105, "votes": 135}, "heading": "the first Hitchcock masterpiece", "date": "2001-02-20T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0022584", "sentiment score": [0.0107, 0.0677, 0.276, 0.5561, 0.0895]}, {"content": "I still have no idea why people like this movie so much.

These issues have been explored more times than anyone would like to remember, but in 'Rebecca' they find voice through Rebecca's ever haunting and ever intrusive presence within the house. Indeed, her memory has found itself to be present in every element of the film, including the sea of course, the letters, statuette's and most importantly every character makes her return into the present. Maxim is the only break in the chain as he wants to forget his past, repress it to the deepest recesses of his mind, whereas he finds this impossible due to her memory almost controlling his future on behalf of those other characters opposed to his ideal.This film begins as a sort of fairy tale in respect to the hauntingly relevant opening shot (again recalling a memory) with its long, slow camera zoom crawling along the twisted driveway to Manderlay, all of which is shadowed by the voice of Joan Fontaine who speaks in a sad and sombre tone attributing to the kinetic effect of this scene with her own dreamy commentary.Although there are many scenes of this film that deserve great merit, and it is still mysterious to me how Hitchcock's directorial maturity and hauntingly simple visual deftness was never recognized by the Academy in terms of best director, the other immortalised scene featured in this film is that which finds the culmination of the relationship with Mrs. de Winter and Mrs. Danver's which takes place, unsurprisingly in Rebecca's bedroom. Again the memory of Rebecca creeps into reality through the cruelty of Mrs. Danver's and the symbolic representation of the sea. The effect of the presence of Rebecca from this scene on firmly roots itself into the present- I won't spoil this entirely brilliant movie more than that.This is, to put it simply, an absolutely unblemished film and in my opinion, is in no doubt Hitchcock's greatest achievement (perhaps in part due to the innocently beautiful Joan Fontaine, not that the other actors aren't great also) or in the least stands next to his other greats 'North by Northwest' and 'The lady Vanishes' - although I must admit I haven't seen some of his films.

After reading the novel by Daphne Du Maurier, I understood much better Mrs. Danvers obsessive devotion to Rebecca. Turns out she had been Rebecca's \"maid\", or \"governess\" since childhood. Strangely, we are not made aware of this in the film. Whether it was omitted deliberately to suggest that Danvers was a lesbian is anyone's guess. It's certainly suggestive, but it's hard to believe Rebecca would have returned any feelings to the loathsome Danvers, either for her looks or her personality. Danvers' obsession seems much more likely to stem from the fact that she had known and cared for Rebecca since childhood, and lived vicariously through her and her high social position.Second, the issue of chemistry between Fontaine and Olivier. It's obvious Olivier is dissatisfied with his co-star, and it creates an interesting effect. I see Rebecca as a story about a man perhaps incapable of expressing love. From their on screen interactions, it's clear to me that De Winter cares deeply for his new bride, but just doesn't know how to show it. Or perhaps his spirit remains poisoned from Rebecca's cruelty. Fontaine's character, meanwhile, is the personification of love and devotion, and will do anything for her Maxim. This is also the feel I get from the novel about both characters. What we see on screen is two people in love, caught in a spider's web woven by the ghost of Rebecca. And there's nothing wrong with that. They don't smolder like Bogart and Bacall, but perhaps they will learn to after the shadow of Rebecca has been vanquished.*spoiler alert* Another important difference from the novel is Rebecca's death. In the novel Maxim shoots her through the heart; on screen, he strikes her but she later stumbles and hits her head on a piece of ships tackle. This could have been changed because of the Motion Picture Code back then, which didn't allow for \"villains\" to go unpunished. If Maxim had killed her, he would have had to pay for it. Or, another interesting possibility is that Maxim lied about it. Maybe he really did kill her and made up the accident? Seems more Hitch's style. Intriguing, though unlikely. But, I digress.The storyline in Rebecca flows smoothly with a steady, highly suspenseful pace. Little by little, we see through Fontaine's eyes and hear through her through ears as more and more of Rebecca's secrets are revealed. We watch her painful ordeal as she struggles to force her meek personality on the imposing domain of Manderly. And in the end, she succeeds.The use of light and shadow in this film is unsurpassed in any black and white film I have seen. The presence of Manderly is constantly thrown on Fontaine's character through the ornate windows, casting their shadows on her. When Beatrice tells her in the study that \"Mrs. Danvers simply adored Rebecca\", we see a close-up of her profile in full lighting as she turns her head in shock and despair, and everything in the background fades to darkness. Hitchcock is showing us how heavily the specter of Rebecca weighs on her mind; she shuts everything and everyone else out.I could go on well past 1000 words about Rebecca. I even loosely based one of the characters in a novel of mine on the Second Mrs. De Winter, and in describing her I quoted Olivier, saying she had that \"funny, young lost look I loved.\" Rebecca should never be lost or forgotten.

Very soon afterwards, however, my mind began to feel very heavy. The first words of the film came floating back to me: \"Last night I dreamt I went to Manderly again.\" I ruminated over the events of the film, and I began to tear up a bit. It creates one of the most unsettling atmospheres ever to exist in a film. I still feel enshrouded in the mist and smoke that curled around Manderly. I can tell that this is going to be one of those films that, when I recall it to memory, I will fall back into its mood. I can't say this for too many films.One of the reasons that I connected with it so tightly was the main character, the narrator, the new Mrs. de Winter. Joan Fontaine was perfect in this film. Out of the ones with whom I am familiar, I don't think that there is another Hitchcock heroine who was as well developed. Kim Novak's character Judy from Vertigo was close, and so was Janet Leigh's character Marion Crane from Psycho. Those two heroines provoked great pity in my soul. But the heroine of Rebecca beats them all.I was completely involved with her. She begins as little more than a slave to a domineering woman, Edythe van Hopper (their relationship was a little confusing to me; a hired friend? This made me suspicious. I think that there was a lot of suggestive lesbianism in this film, perhaps between van Hopper and the heroine, but definitely between Rebecca and Ms. Danvers. Watch as she delicately shows the second Mrs. de Winters Rebecca's underwear. Also notice that Rebecca used Ms. Danvers' name at the doctor's office, having gone there to find out whether or not she was pregnant). The heroine only escapes from one owner to go to her next owner, Maxim de Winters. He treats her even more cruelly than Edythe van Hopper did, calling her a \"little fool\" and an \"idiot.\" When he called her those names and reprimanded her, I trembled. As the movie went on, I think my mind actually became fused with the heroine's. I started to cry when she did after Ms. Danvers tortured her psychologically. When Ms. Danvers tried to convince her to jump out of the window, I felt as if I was about to fall to my death.I became rather disappointed when the focus moves from the heroine to Maxim. His predicament became more interesting near the end, but my sympathies, my whole attention were squarely focused on Fontaine's character. Thus arose my initial impression of the film. This small disruption can be forgiven, because the film as a whole just remains in my mind as a sad, beautiful masterpiece.Rebecca is one of Hitchcock's best films.

Yet to see some other good Hitchcock movies like, Strangers on a Train, The Rope, Lifeboat, Shadow of a Doubt, Foreign Correspondence and Dial M for Murder.Hitchcock never won an Oscar as best director. But this was the only Hitchcock movie to ever win the Best Picture. Joan Fontain gave her best shot as a confused housewife tormented by the memories of Rebecca. One of the best acting in the film history in the role of a leading female character. I was surprised to know that Fontaine didn't win the Oscar. She won it a year later in another Hitchcock movie, Suspicion.

Also, for the time period, I could not think of a better actor to play Maxim than Sir Laurence Olivier. Not only is he extremely talented, but he is exceptionally handsome as well.
