I really congratulate all the actors of this movie. There were very difficult stunts in this movie, although it is said that Keanu did most of the stunts himself, but it is not believable. One of the wonders of this movie is its lighting. And it was very good that this four-part movie ended with all its excitement and the peace they considered for John was very appropriate and acceptable with all the hardships he went through and the people he lost along the way.

After 3 movies you think they'd be running out of steam, but they manage to up the game again.Without giving anything away, the pacing is good. The start is pretty relentless, the middle has some story building and the final third goes from one wonderfully shot sequence to the next, it was a joy to watch and so well pulled off - not a single piece of shakey cam in this movie. Just clear, believable performances given by dedicated actors and coordinators. I know months of training goes into these types of sequences, especially from Keeanu who even at a high tier will feel he can improve upon it.The storyline is fairly decent, we see other talented actors like Hiroyuki Sanada (great with a sword) and Donnie Yen. There's also a big moment story-wise which probably helps set up The Continental (a mini series this autumn) but I won't say anything about this, the viewer will have to watch it.Overall, a great movie, it doesn't really feel too much like a rehash as brings some new ideas and cinematography to the table.

The action is intense, with each fight scene being expertly choreographed and executed. The action set pieces are some of the most memorable I've ever seen, with each one being more jaw-dropping than the last.One of the standout aspects of John Wick 4 is the villains. This time around, they are more interesting than ever, with big-name actors bringing their A-game to their respective roles. It's always great to see veteran actors like Keanu Reeves and Laurence Fishburne on screen, but the addition of newcomers like Bill Skarsgard and Donnie Yen really elevates the movie.But perhaps the real star of John Wick 4 is the fight cinematography. The one-take fight scene that was filmed from overhead is a work of art. It's so seamless and fluid that you feel like you're right there in the middle of the action. The attention to detail in every fight scene is astounding, with each punch and kick feeling like it has real weight behind it.One slight negative of the movie is that John Wick doesn't have much development. However, this is a minor quibble, as the movie is so focused on delivering incredible action that the lack of character development doesn't really matter. After all, John Wick is at his best when he's kicking ass, and he certainly does that in spades in this movie.Overall, John Wick 4 is a fantastic entry in the series. The sense of finality that permeates throughout the movie is perfect, and it really feels like a fitting end to the story. If you're a fan of action movies, then John Wick 4 is an absolute must-see.

Well, with this being a \"John Wick\" movie, then of course you know that the narrative is not really the driving force here, it is the abundance of action. The storyline is fairly okay, take it for what it is, and just enjoy the action.And an abundance of action there was to be seen in \"John Wick: Chapter 4\", that was for certain. Maybe even a bit too much actually, because running at 169 minutes, it was a long, long movie. And it was getting a bit tedious towards the last 30 minutes or so to sit through. I mean, even while the action sequences are nicely choreographed and feels like a nicely orchestrated dance sequence, then it got repetitive to watch John Wick waltz almost unscathed through hordes of gunmen and putting one bullet in the head of one after another. Don't get me wrong, it was definitely good entertainment, and I was genuinely entertained, but the movie was long.\"John Wick: Chapter 4\" has a good cast ensemble. Of course it is nice to see Keanu Reeves return to the role of John Wick, and he was joined by other returning actors such as Laurence Fishburne, Lance Reddick and Ian McShane. The movie also have some nice performances and appearances by the likes of Clancy Brown,\nDonnie Yen, Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, Shamier Anderson and Hiroyuki Sanada. Now, Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd was an interesting choice for the main villain in \"John Wick: Chapter 4\", and he did a good job, though his attempt of a French-English accent was a bit all over the place.Visually then \"John Wick: Chapter 4\" is quite good, as it has been throughout all of the previous movies as well. I was especially pleased with the sequence that took place inside an old building where you see the action from a bird's view, top-down. That was such a blast of a sequence.This is an action movie, first and foremost. And you are in for a treat of action, because \"John Wick: Chapter 4\" is nearly 169 minutes of non-stop action. Don't think realism into the picture when you sit down to watch this movie, because realism is way out the window. Just lean back, have your snacks ready and enjoy the non-stop action roller coaster.I was genuinely entertained by the movie, I will say that, though the movie could have benefitted a bit from a more extensive trim in the editing room.All in all, a good fourth movie in a very enjoyable franchise all together. My rating of \"John Wick: Chapter 4\" lands on a seven out of ten stars. The movie is worth an eight star rating, but the long playtime sort of felt like an anchor around the overall enjoyment of the movie, and thus drags it down to a seven star rating for me.", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Action, more action, and then even more action...", "date": "2023-05-14T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9055728"}, {"content": "The hype for this movie is on another level...It seems John Wick gains fall-damage immunity at the end of Chapter 3.The falls he survives are insane!Bad guys die instantly from lesser falls in the movie, but John just gets up, shrugs it off, and starts shooting like nothing happened.Every scene is meticulously made, but it's blurred behind the shower of bullets fired every milisecond.In a big city scene, the fight is on throughout the city.

I went into this film having watched the previous 3 John Wicks and thinking that I knew what to expect. I was wrong.This movie is incredibly tedious. The fight scenes, while choreographed well, are nothing new and they drag on and become extremely repetitive over the three hour run time.This is not helped by the fact that everyone now wears magical kevlar suits that stop bullets, so now Wick gets to shoot people 4-5 times each without effect before finally closing in and either shooting or stabbing them in the head.That brings me to my next point. This movie asks for a RIDICULOUS amount of suspension of disbelief from the audience.The most outrageous example perhaps being that we are supposed to accept that Donnie Yens character is blind and yet can somehow outshoot and out swordfight trained assassins over and over again. HOW exactly?Then there was John Wicks ability to absorb superhuman levels of damage (whether falling from a building or being hit by cars, it has about as much effect as hitting him with a pool noodle) This, combined with the bulletproof suit made him seemingly invincible.The movie culminates with John Wick spending about 20 minutes casually mowing down a hundred or so men very publicly in the heart of Paris, many in front of passing vehicles at a major landmark. Apparently there are no police in Paris, as none ever show up.When John Wick fell down the stairs I chuckled, but then groaned in synch with the character as I realised that he now had to fight his way back up again. At that point I really just wanted the movie to end.Neither the plot or script is smart or witty, the action was repetitive and I could not suspend my disbelief enough to enjoy the film.

Apparently the director would like you to belief that if you hold up a icee of Kevlar fabric then bullets... I dunno... bounce off?That's not how Kevlar works, people. The Kevlar might stop the bullet from penetrating, but it does nothing to mitigate the kinetic energy of the bullet.I watched a news reporter \"demonstrate\" his Kevlar vest, as he had a fellow employee literally shot him with a low caliber bullet from close range. The vest did stop the bullet, but the impact knocked him on his back and broke two ribs.You can hold up your Kevlar jacket lapel and the the bullet's energy will rip it out of your hand and, best case scenario, break half the bones in your face.Then there is the fact that all those trained killers seem unable to hit anything vital, despite the two or three thousand rounds fired. They must all be retired Galactic Stormtroopers.Then there's this dog that keeps killing assassins, but apparently only one of them ever thought about shooting the dog.

They don't have much of a plot, and the acting isn't great...but it doesn't have to be, because they have AMAZING action sequences. The first half of John Wick 4 is no exception. In fact, it's a Master's Class in fight scene choreography, that manages to be both clever, and occasionally humorous, in its brutality. I particularly appreciated their recognition of nun chucks as the blunt instruments they are. With the physics involved it takes 0 training to use them effectively (notice I didn't say well)- after all, they are illegal in the US for a reason. Any moron can generate tremendous force with two sticks and a string, and will be just fine as long as they don't miss. John Wick knows what to do when he misses, but he mostly just swings the crap out of them...and it's glorious.Then they jumped the shark. Potential spoilers beyond this point.Where they started to lose me was with a sweaty mobster with a bullet in his butt moving like an uninjured Olympic martial artist. Wick surviving a fall that at the very least should have been life altering further chipped away at my suspension of disbelief...especially since a similar fall ultimately killed the sweaty mobster with the inhaler.But where they really lost me, was the dog. I didn't want the dog to die. I never want the dog to die. But if you hit a dog with a car hard enough to dent it, it's not going to pop back up like nothing happened, in all its obviously CGI glory...and that removed all the tension. If the dog can't die, neither can the important humans. If the important humans can't die, there are no stakes. If there are no stakes, there is no excitement...and it's boring.

The cinematography even during slow conversations is beautiful. The lighting, sets, music so stylistic. The action performed in choreographed long takes. Sometimes ridiculously long takes. The whole John Wick series is a loveletter to all stuntmen and action fans. An action movie done right, and the small screen does not do this series justice.

I had no idea. The time just flew right by.Chad Stahelski does not pull any punches (or engage the safety) at any time in this gun-fu epic. Combat scenes are not moments so much as they are entire acts. The amount of stunt choreography that everybody had to synchronize to was rather incredible, and they continue to find more ways to entertain us with kills, kill types, use of weapons, locations, teamwork, etc. I caught myself smiling for minutes on end several times while watching it.Of course though, as I said, they really lean into it. I'm sure this has been true of previous films as well, but it is very apparent that John Wick should virtually die in every scene that he is in. Whether it is how he is attacked or how they fail to attack him at the right times, he goes at every foe like the bear in The Revenant with full adrenaline and no signs of slowing down no matter what he is hit by. And again, I think if you look hard enough you will find enemies who have clear shots and choose not to take them because of plot armor, but you can forgive it enough if you're rewarded with a longer take or overall longer action sequence. What I really loved was how many of these scenes took place at night with dazzlingly lit environments all around, and the music in every scene kicks as much *** as what you see on screen. I had pondered over why John Wick doesn't have a video game yet, but if they ever make one I have decided I'd like one of those top-down shooter games (similar to The Hong Kong Massacre, and if not maybe like the GTA:SA MP rampage style).I acknowledge this franchise for what it is now, but I still pine for some of the missing components that I don't know if it'll ever be able to bring back. After watching John Wick, fun as it was, I found myself interested in seeing a prequel when he was the Baba Yaga in his prime, taking missions rather than being hunted. Even still, at least in that movie he was absolutely feared. In Chapter 2, I still found him heavily respected, but it was in that movie that I realized there would probably be a repetitive formula to the narrative and movie/action structure (which still has yet to break). In Chapter 3, there only lived assassins and they would go after him without hesitation, which did is not how I felt the world breathed the first time around. They continue down this path in Chapter 4, while opening the universe more to different characters breeding their own kind of loyalty. They are all insanely fun to watch, and you see the cogwheels of the John Wick universe spinning with the future Continental television show and the Ballerina movie spinoff. Where they remain faulty though is even with the existence of civilians during fight scenes, they act as droning NPC's like nothing is happening around them, or they aren't there whatsoever. It is clear that this is not our world that this movie takes place in, but rather a parallel one.I mentioned the introduction of new characters in this world, and you can't not bring up Donnie Yen when talking about them. He steals each and every scene that he is in, and it's crazy because you wonder how a character like his could thrive in such a world but you absolutely believe it when you watch it. I will absolutely take more of him and Rina Sawayama. She isn't featured as much, but she makes use of every second that she is in front of the camera. There are plenty of others (such as the great Hiroyuki Sanada), but the point remains that Wick is relegated to this greater universe with characters who-good, bad, or for themselves-are ones we can actually root for in any fight. Keanu Reeves is understandably less nimble at his age than the others (and it's either bad acting or he really has taken on this John Wick role in his line delivery to hilarious new heights), but he and Stahelski have found a groove that still makes him the most impenetrable force around, to the point that I go back and watch the action scenes in The Matrix Resurrections and wonder what happened there. I didn't love one particular character in their big fighting moment(s), but they go for versatility and I have to give them that much.March has had an incredible run of theatrical films, and John Wick: Chapter 4 is no different. You will lean forward during the action which there is plenty, and if I'm one to go off of you will not feel the runtime. There is an end credits scene as well if you're able to stay for a moment longer.

And I, being a fan of this universe, went to the cinema and watched it on the first day of rental and I want to tell you about my impressions.So, the film tells about another confrontation between John and his new enemies: an old friend of Kane (Donnie Yen), one of the high-ranking members of the Marquis de Gramont's High Table (Bill Skarsgard) and an unnamed mercenary with a dog. John has found a way to defeat the Clan Board and wants to end this confrontation forever, but the Clan Board and the mercenaries continue to hunt for him. Marquis has received an unlimited amount of resources to destroy the \"Boogeyman\" and is trying to kill him with all his might, sparing no one in his path.I must say right away, I really liked the movie. Chad Stahelski managed to maintain a special atmosphere, such as the first three films, and at the same time increased the timing of the fourth part, compared to the others.Despite this length of the film, it is interesting to watch. It is filled with interesting, colorful, breath-taking moments. It is immediately clear that a piece of the soul has been invested in the production.The whole team has done a huge and painstaking job. A variety of locations (France, Germany, Japan), a lot of well-shot and spectacularly shown action scenes, excellent musical accompaniment and excellent acting.As a result, I really liked the film, I would even call this part the best.

The film follows John Wick as he travels the globe, battling old and new foes to earn his freedom. The film stars Keanu Reeves, Donnie Yen, Laurence Fishburne, Ian McShane, and Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd.This film has the best action of the franchise, provided by what seems like all of the stunt performers in Hollywood. The fight choreography is impressive and complex. Even though the film is nearly three hours long, I never got bored as the action sequences were very entertaining. Like the previous John Wick films, many of the action sequences feature \"gun-fu,\" a mix of firearms and hand to hand combat. I was also surprised by the comedic aspect of some of the action, as many scenes have an almost slapstick nature.Another aspect of the film that was expertly executed was the film's cinematography and set design. Many of the fight scenes occurred in interesting settings that utilized vibrant and appealing colors. The fight scenes were also captured with long takes, showcasing all of the difficult choreography that the actors had to memorize. A certain action sequence comes to mind when thinking of cinematography, which was especially impressive. This scene was captured from a bird's eye view, similar to a video game and there were no visible cuts during this scene.Speaking of video games, this film improved on the previous film's shortcoming: the story. While the events of the last film felt inconsequential, this film returned to the franchise's roots, delivering a simple story with great action. The film's story is structured like a video game, with John Wick having to complete clear and simple objectives. Many of these objectives lead to boss fights, where the film's side characters shine. A memorable and recurring boss was the legendary Donnie Yen, who played an antagonist that you almost wanted to root for.My only issue with the film is a plot hole during the film's first act. This plot hole was that John Wick was in a certain location for no apparent reason. Unfortunately, his presence in this location is a very important aspect of the film.John Wick: Chapter 4 is an excellent action film that features spectacular action scenes, memorable side characters, and an entertaining Keanu Reeves at the top of his game.

I'm always a little surprised at that, but it's hard not to be impressed with the incredibly well choreographed violence they are all built on, and by now with Chapter 4 that's the whole point. JW4 has not one but three outstanding set pieces to its credit: the gunfight inside a building, seen from above as if we're looking down on a dollhouse (my favorite); the combat-in-traffic at the Arc de Triomphe; and then the long fight up (and down) that staircase below Sacre Coeur. All of them go on past any semblance of realism, but again, that's the point.These movies exist far into a fantasy world of their own making. In this one I felt that it was starting to move into Tarantino-like territory: various scenes start out with long stretches of simple, almost banal dialog and only then erupt into complicated combat. Keanu Reaves as the title hero never did get much of a script to work with in the previous rounds, but here his lines have been pared down to almost nothing. However, he can get more out of a simple 'yeah' than any other actor I can think of.At almost 3 hours run time there's enough material here for almost two movies, and that's the main problem I had with it.

My satisfaction isn't only that this long ride has ended on a high note but also elevated all the previous sequels that felt directionless. All the unsatisfying exploration that reduced the enigma of the original movie all comes together with this final piece of the puzzle and paints a beautiful picture that is summed up by John Wick himself, the whole franchise revolves around a loving husband trying to attain peace. In a ride with no time to pause for emotional development this characterisation of Wick by himself is dense enough to add sufficient depth to the character that barely speaks and doesn't emote. It's like a star that expands viciously and the unsustainable chemical reaction causes the star to collapse on itself. This summeration is the collapse that starts the process of transforming this ferosous red giant into a nicely dense white dwarf.The best aspect of the movie is that it maximises style in order to make up for its little substance. The sharp focus results in memorable villains and henchmen, stunning locations, and consistent pulling with engaging choreography that never feels familiar within a three hour movie or multiple hours of movies in this franchise. Cain being blind was not necessary, Scott Adkins being in a fatsuit was not necessary, Skarsgard's French accent wasn't necessary, but all of these gave style like how a suit styles a gentleman. I loved that you explore John Wicks spiritual side with a light conversation about talking to his deceased wife and meeting his family and friends who have a genuine relationship with Wick unlike his previous companions who seemed more transactional than a feeling of love and loyalty.The beauty of this movie is primarily based on two aspects, everybody wears a suit and all the locations were traditional churches with mediaeval architecture. The religious imagery such as crosses, clergy and candles adds real world elements that connect with the audience. The action scenes are clean and the top down perspective was executed brilliantly.The only thing that stops it from being perfect is it's long runtime. The substance of the film doesn't justify the extend length of the movie but the style is gravitating. A slight amount of fat could have been trimmed like John's first adventure in the desert, cutting to the DJ and causing a break in the action frequently and Nobody meeting with the Marquis. The final nitpick is there are an unnecessary amount of tattoos that conflict with the traditional styles in other aspects of the movie.

You have to almost accept that this world exists in an alternate reality where police simply do not exist, other than of course when it comes to Jimmy attending a noise complaint at the Wick residence in the first movie. John is basically impervious to pain or injury, as shown when falling 4 stories onto a car/pavement and proceeds to shrug it off. And a blind man who is equal to John in both hand to hand and shooting. Donnie doesn't have the Force in this one, or maybe he does, I don't know.All that being said, I love the fight scenes and the gun culture. The production and the cinematography were great.

That should tell you how much I both loved and hated this movie at the same time.The fight choreography is probably the best in a movie I have ever seen.

I can't wait until I can get this movie for my home theater.Additionally, the movie is visually stunning. Add that to the sound and it is a movie that challenges your senses.Now, the bad news. The storyline is flat-out lazy. There is no plot or character development in the entire film. They introduced important characters where the backstory seemed important, but they didn't even pay lip service to it. They introduced plot items but never developed them.Don't get me wrong, I never felt the storyline in any of the John Wick movies were Oscar worthy but, at least, there were interesting characters that you cared about where they came from and what happened to them. In John Wick 4, there was none of that.Specifically, here are some things that left me disappointed (queue spoilers).1) In the opening scene they re-introduced the Bowery King who they had set up as a major character in Parabellum but did very little in the way of developing his character and role other than that a 2-minute clip where he is walking in the shadows declaring greatness and then asking John Wick if he is \"ready.\"2) The only thing you see about Wick's refuge and preparation to take on the High Table is him punching a wood board wrapped in rope. Then in the very next scene he is riding a horse in the desert. WTF?3) They introduce Marquis (Bill Skaarsgard) and nothing about him at all is ever revealed. He has some cool monologues to advance the story but nothing really interesting about him. What a waste of a great talent.4) They killed off Charon in the early part of the film so Winston didn't have to die. In reality, it didn't serve any purpose because Winston was just a prop in the rest of the film.5) The past relationships between Wick, Koji, and Caine shaped a lot of the actions of the film but they didn't even spend 5 minutes developing that backstory. They surely could have cut out a few minutes of fight scenes to do that.6) Akira was a badass in the making and other than the contribution to the assault on the hotel she isn't heard from again until a post credit scene where she all of a sudden mattered again.7) The last two scenes where Winston \"took Wick home\" followed immediately by a picture of his grave site were lazy. It's setting up a lazy John Wick 5 (if they actually decide to make the film) opening where all of a sudden he was actually alive intro. And if this is the end of the Babba Yaga it is a disappointing outro to an amazing character.In the end, the move was just 3 hours of fight scenes and virtually no story.

John, Winston and The Bowery King really feel like three lifelong friends here, and the deaths of John and Charon are both very impactfulNEGATIVES:1) Some of the action scenes do go on for too long. They're very impressive, but they become a bit ridiculously over the top at times\n2) Mr Nobody never truly felt like a relevant character to me. He was always just in the background and his resolution with John happens too quickly without the two of them ever properly engaging in combat\n3) I rolled my eyes a bit at the two main new characters here, Marquis and Caine. I understand that The High Table is supposed to be a worldwide crime empire, but with every film that goes by in this franchise new members of the Table are introduced, as well as new elite assassins for John to have to defeat.

Its long shots bring us a reality in the fights and the different fighting weapons like samurai swords, bats, guns and martial arts with several different scenarios for each fight plan.One thing that I would like to say is good in the film are its references to Lawrence of Arabia in the first minutes of the film, such as the famous match edition, the open shots of the Arabian desert and the clothes being a classic reference to the classic film.Already bringing a negative point are some absurdities of fights and narratives, but it is not something that makes you stay away from the experience.Grade 8.4/10.If I could watch it, watch it because worth.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "An Intense and high quality action movie", "date": "2023-04-23T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9011285"}, {"content": "The movie was simply bad.

John wants his freedom from the high table so his plan was to assassinate all 12 members so he could achieve that however he soon finds out the only way to earn his freedom is by challenging the Marquis's played by Bill Skarsgard in single combat. The rule is that you have to go get a crest from your family but his family refuses to give it to him until he earns their loyalty again. He is tasked with assassinating someone who killed the Cadia's son, John achieves this task with ease. He is to meet the Marquis at sunrise but the city doesn't make it easy. People fight him in the streets, he gets run over by cars, falls off buildings and as he's going to the set location he continually gets knocked down the 200 stairs.

Maybe it's that he just says less. And he knows a little bit (or a lot) more about himself. He knows his strengths and weaknesses. This guy has really earned me as a fan.

It is still hard to believe that Keanu, at the age of 58, is still able to perform the stunts on show in this film. There is a great combo of hand to hand, gun combat, sword fighting and some insane action set pieces. Even though some of action does become a bit over the top and drags on too long, it still manages to blow you away.The production design, cinematography and lighting continue to shine through. The night-life shots and sequences where the colours are accentuated continue to be a visual spectacle.The film did slack on the narrative front. I felt that John Wick had no clear goal in this movie and was just going from objective to objective, defeating anyone who stood in his way.Also, as much as I love Keanu, I really did not enjoy his acting. I understand Wick is supposed to be this reserved, almost emotion-less boogeyman, but Keanu just had too many cheesy one-liners. I struggled to take him seriously.Bill Scarsgard as the Marquis (the main antagonist and villainous representative of the High Table) was okay. His character felt too similar to the The Ajudicator from the previous film.I really enjoyed Donnie Yen's portrayal as the blind assassin, Caine. His swift, ruthless fighting style really stood out. I also liked the unique relationship he shared with Wick. I also cannot ignore the crazy German kingpin, Killa (Scott Adkins). He was a fun charismatic villian.I am a big fan of John Wick universe world and the various characters that inhabit it. Therefore, I can say that despite its flaws, John Wick is still a fun and captivating experience which continues to push its action to the next level.Definitely worth your time!", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 3}, "heading": "Great, but with a some flaws", "date": "2023-04-20T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9006588"}, {"content": "I haven't written a review on IMDB in a while, but after watching JW4 last night I wanted to get my thoughts out there, although they are seemingly against the majority of fans and reviewers out there.My thoughts on the series as a whole are that #1 was something special. It made me and many of its fans feel something when we watched it. It had emotional impact and weight, that really was the core of the movie. Sure the action was innovative and fantastic, and Keanu was awesome, but it was all meaningful and heavy.Number #2 did a lot of things wrong that started the downfall of the series. The lore of the continental assassins universe was just botched plain and simple, and it lead to horrible writing decisions. Instead of John taking on a mission of his own will like the first, a new rule is invented as a plot devise to \"make\" him do something, which was pointless anyway because he then tries to kill the guy who is making him do all this anyway. Then instead of being an amazing assassin and figuring out how to kill the guy, he just breaks the main rule and gets everyone rightfully against him because he broke the one rule. It also introduced the stupid invincible suits that was the first step into fantasy and superpowers.#3 was a huge downgrade further, with far more ridiculous continental lore, terrible writing like having John do one thing, only to undo that by doing the opposite which he could have done in the first place, even more fantasy magic suit nonsense, and multiple massive injuries that should have killed him, like cars hitting him and falling off a building onto metal railing.After hearing great things about it from personalities I listened to, I had high hopes that the silliness of #3 would be left behind with #4, but those were lies. #4 doubles, triples, quintuples down on all the worst parts of #3. More stupid suit nonsense. A dog mauling people throughout the movie. Cars hitting John multiple times, and at least deadly falls off buildings that doesn't slow him down. It's as bad as fast and the furious now, maybe even worse.I was thinking about why it was so bad, and it occurred to me that you really couldn't parody this movie. Think about typical John Wick clich\u00e9s that you could parody. Maybe having a joke of him shooting someone in the head way too many times when its not necessary, oh wait this has that already. Having him fall from obviously deadly height, only to brush it off and get up, oh it has that. Have him get hit by 5 cars in a row, that would be funny, oh wait they had that too.Perhaps the worst for me is the ending, and the writing is so bad, I'm not even sure its worth breaking down. None of the writing or decisions make sense, and it seems the writers thought they were being deep, and it seems people are falling for it at the moment. I can only hope that once the hype wears off people can think clearly and realize how awful the story is andTo sum it up, even after #3 I still felt I saw a John Wick movie and hoped they could at least do more of that, but even those low expectations were dashed. From a technical standpoint this movie could be a 6, but making this franchise into a parody of itself is not something I can overlook, and I think it needs to be called out. I was more unhappy than I was happy while watching this, which puts it under 5, and the more I thought about it, the more appalled I became, so in all honesty this is a 2 for me.", "rating": 2, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 4, "votes": 6}, "heading": "Descended into Parody", "date": "2023-04-20T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9006524"}, {"content": "If you want to watch this film for the wonderfully woven together story line, your going to be disappointed.

The story itself is almost superfluous to the action, but after a while it gets almost comical. By the time John (Keanu Reeves) rolled down the stairs for the third time, I wasn't the only one with an audible chuckle, someone in the theater behind me also felt the irony of Wick's miraculous ability to survive multiple assassins, falling out of buildings, and get right back up after getting hit by multiple moving vehicles. All done to pulse pounding music and incredible action cinematography, highlighted by that incredible dragon breath gun fight with flashing pyrotechnics. Lest you think I'm being critical, I do enjoy this kind of stuff but you do have to enter a film like this with some semblance of disbelief.

But I can say that by about 3/4 of the way through the audience was laughing and cheering the mayhem.One can't help but be utterly impressed with Reeves' Wick portrayal.

This is the first film of the series not to involve the creator of the franchise Derek Kolstand with the screenplay instead written by Shay Hatten and Michael Finch. Reeves reprises his now iconic role as John Wick seeking to make the High Table pay for the wrongs done to him. Ian McShane, Lance Reddick and Laurence Fishburne all return with the notable additions of Donnie Yen, Bill Skarsgard and Clancy Brown. Originaly slated for 2021 the production was delayed to the COVID-19 pandemic, and 'John Wick 4' was finally released in March of 2023 to generally positive reviews as well as box office success on par with the previous film. While the door remains slightly ajar for a potential fifth film this seems like the end of the line for the John Wick character for the foreseeable1 future.This story finds John at once hunting the High Table as well as being hunted by them. To this end the High Table enlists Skarsgard's Marquis Vincent de Gramont, granting him unlimited resources, to dispatch Wick. He controls a veritable army of soldiers with a typical goon no. 1 at their forefront who is saved for an eventual showdown with Wick. Gramont also enlists Donnie Yen's Caine who is a reluctant servitor, but will do his duty to keep his daughter safe. Meanwhile Wick gets aid from familiar sources including the Bowery King and Winston. A new random player also hunts Wick as an unprecedented bounty has been placed on him. This new character is Mr. Nobody and played by Shamiar Anderson complete with attack dog companion which is very reminiscent of Halle Berry's character from the previous film. Despite the flood tide of bad guys thrown at John he wades through it broken and battered but still ready to fight for a final showdown with the Marquis at an appointed time and place for all the marbles whatever those marbles might be.'John Wick 4' is super-sized clocking at at nearly three hours, and it feels bloated. Wick is getting it from all sides, and when the story begins I have a hard time understanding what he is actually trying to accomplish. Is he seeking revenge or absolution or just a way out? With the High Table after him all he does is put people in danger wherever he goes which is made abundantly clear in one of the first extended action sequences. This movie continues to play with this assassin subculture mythology they have created. Here it starts to get a bit more wonky as they seem to twist the mythology to accomplish the story rather than setting their story within a mythology. The action is intense and extended as one would expect. It is interesting that the first film made its name with a very economical form of stylized action, but as these sequels demand new and more intense sequences more emphasis has been placed on the stylized aspect of the violence losing the austere functionality that initially made it interesting. There are some superlative action moments, but mainly due to the settings rather than the action itself which becomes redundant simply due to sheer volume. You can feel them stretching to create different scenarios in order to not make it all feel the same. The production design and cinematography are sumptuous in this film and probably the best thing about the film as a whole. The addition of the Mr. Nobody character did not make much sense and just added run time. It felt like they really wanted some more non white representation, and just shoehorned in this superfluous character who I never really connected with and was constantly wondering why he was there. On the other hand I loved Donnie Yen and his off kilter somewhat nonchalant approach to his character.If you enjoyed the other John Wick films there is enough here that you will enjoy this as well, but there is also the concept of too much of a good thing, and 'John Wick 4' enters that territory. The action just gets to be too much, and I found it hilarious as everyone is running around with these bulletproof suits which was a cool novelty two movies ago, but now becomes laughable as they shield themselves with their sportcoats like they are superhero capes. The movie has an overly long running time with a story that ultimately doesn't do anything with a more than ambivalent ending. The story itself didn't make sense for the character of John Wick. For two movies I have been waiting for him to go after this mysterious and seemingly unreachable High Table, and that battle never materializes except by proxy so based on that the plot was a disappointment. For what is supposed to be the final chapter I was just really hoping for something more.

The film is not just an action fiesta which to be clear the action is monumental good, it also has so much heart and story to it that some of the previous outings in my opinion had less of just makes this film all the more impressive. Keanu reeves for a guy of his age may have just given a peak movie of his entire career and it's some of the absolute best action along with some very impactful story moments such as Wick accepting his life or his reactions which are so perfectly timed they seem so flawless that even some of the modern great films can't compete to except a few.Negatives: after such a high bar set by John wick 4, it is also easy to notice that some stunts are just so over the top like the action is the greatest in the franchise but the stunts are also the most over the top of the franchise without a doubt. Along with that, I could easily see a better version of Killa not to say the one we got is bad, he's an intimidating fellow with power who's trying to hunt down our main hero and somewhere I see the cause that's driving him but sometimes the cause shouldn't be there. Sometimes you just need that pure evil T-1000 kind of part where even though he looks awesome he's clearly not the good guy, sometimes it's just missed in these kind of franchises.Conclusion: if they gave us an even reckless villain, this would easily be in my top 5 of favorite action movies of all-time but its still close, because this stuntwork and action is once in a decade level good and im very sure there will hardly be any films that can give the action of this film a run for its money as being the best action work of all-time.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "My favorite of the John Wick films if not also arguably the best John Wick film", "date": "2023-04-18T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9002382"}, {"content": "John Wick: Chapter 4 delivers another thrilling and action-packed ride that is sure to please fans of the franchise. Directed by Chad Stahelski and starring Keanu Reeves in the title role, this latest installment picks up where the previous film left off and takes the audience on a journey filled with intense fight scenes, high-stakes drama, and breathtaking visuals.The story picks up with John Wick on the run after being declared excommunicado by the High Table, the shadowy organization that governs the world of assassins. With a $14 million bounty on his head, Wick must use all his skills and cunning to survive and take down his enemies. Along the way, he reunites with old allies and makes new ones, including Sofia (Halle Berry), a fellow assassin with her own set of skills and demons.One of the standout features of the John Wick franchise is its use of action sequences to drive the plot forward. The fight scenes in Chapter 4 are no exception and are some of the most impressive and inventive in the series. From a motorcycle chase through the streets of Paris to a brutal battle in a subway station, each set-piece is expertly choreographed and executed, showcasing the talents of the actors and stunt performers. It's clear that the filmmakers have a deep respect for the craft of action filmmaking and are committed to pushing the boundaries of what's possible.But John Wick: Chapter 4 isn't just about the action. The film also delves deeper into the mythology and world-building of the franchise. We learn more about the High Table and its inner workings, as well as the motivations and backstories of some of the key characters. There are also some surprising twists and turns that keep the audience guessing and add new layers of complexity to the narrative.Of course, no review of a John Wick film would be complete without mentioning the performance of Keanu Reeves. Reeves has always been a charismatic and likable actor, but in this role, he truly shines. He brings a sense of world-weary gravitas to the character of John Wick, and his physicality and commitment to the role are evident in every scene. Reeves is also surrounded by a talented supporting cast, including Halle Berry, Ian McShane, and Laurence Fishburne, who all bring their own unique energy and flair to their respective roles.Another standout aspect of John Wick: Chapter 4 is its visuals. The film is shot by veteran cinematographer Dan Laustsen, who has worked on previous installments in the franchise as well as other visually stunning films like The Shape of Water. Laustsen's use of color and composition is breathtaking, and he brings a sense of style and elegance to the proceedings that elevates the material beyond typical action movie fare.In conclusion, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a thrilling and satisfying addition to the franchise. It's clear that the filmmakers have a deep respect for the craft of action filmmaking and are committed to delivering an experience that is both thrilling and emotionally engaging. With its impressive action sequences, deepening mythology, and strong performances, this latest installment is sure to please fans of the series and newcomers alike.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "John Wick: Chapter 4 delivers another thrilling and action-packed ride", "date": "2023-04-18T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9002099"}, {"content": "I can see why people love it and I can see why people hate it. People want different things out of a movie and John Wick 4 delivers exceptionally well in certain areas while being mediocre in others.A quick summary is I had a fking great time watching it at some points and a little bored during others. The action scenes are fantastic. It's a TON of fun and really cool to watch. A little towards the middle of the film it did feel a bit slow and dragged out. Cutting out 15 mins would be perfect.Held up by good action and decent laughs is the weak story. I absolutely LOVE the idea of the underground black market, the continentals, and the high table. I wish we got to see more of that world. I wanted more backstory, more exposure, more display of how they ran behind the scenes. Hopefully I'll get to see that in the Ballerina and Continental.The other thing I think hindered the movie was that the idea of the high table got watered down. They started off as some serious group that mean business that you don't want to mess with. In John Wick 4 I felt like they were kind of a joke and not really as big as mean as people made them out to be. John Wick was just so broken in the 4th chapter. I know it's the whole appeal of John Wick but it does take away from the story and suspense when, even with suspension of disbelief, is just pure absolute absurdity. But that's also why I love it!I swear John Wick can take more hits than some Avengers. He's like a tank with the body of Wolverine.But regardless of what you're looking for you have to give it to the crew for how much work and dedication they put in to this movie. The quality really shows here. It's just really fun and exciting to watch. I rate it higher than the other John Wick films even though it's not my favorite just because in 9 out of 10 ways it's bigger and better.But I love the other John Wick films because we got more backstory, more Continental, and more focus on story.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Beautifully absurd.", "date": "2023-04-17T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9001382"}, {"content": "A friend from my poker game invited me to go with him to see this film.

Most modern action/fight choreography in Hollywood at least owes itself to the Wick franchise and the incredible action design and direction of Chad Stahelski and David Leitch. John Wick 4 proves why their work can be imitated but not surpassed as they push the stunts, choreography, and spectacle to even further levels of well-shot, deliberately constructed insanity beyond any of the other installments.I consider myself a fairly knowledgeable connoisseur of action, martial arts, and stunt-heavy films, and while it might be early to say given how new it is, John Wick 4 might be one of the best action films of all time. It's certainly one of the best of the last 10 years, even beyond the other films in the Wick franchise which are all at a high standard.You have Keanu of course, the legendary Hiroyuki Sanada, the peerless Donnie Yen, greats like Scott Adkins (in an unforgettable role) and Marko Zaror, as well as the always excellent Ian McShane, Laurence Fishburne, Bill Skarsgaard, Clancy Brown and the gone-too-soon, classy and distinguished Lance Reddick, who always brought a level of distinction, refinement, and commitment to every project he touched. Newcomers Shamier Anderson and singer Rina Sawayama are also excellent additions to the franchise and bring a level of freshness and energy to each of their roles as well.John Wick 4 is long, it's not a quick watch. That's one of the main flaws I can point to for the film. The issue is that there's so many satisfying action scenes that are so well set-up, it's tough to think of what you'd cut out. I can see why the finished cut was damn near 3 hours, which is a long time for a shoot-em-up with this straightforward of a plot.For action fans, this demands to be seen at least twice. There's too many high-quality action scenes for it to be viewed once, so many well-made battles and set pieces all packed into one movie.A single scene from John Wick 4 would be another film's action climax. Most movies are lucky to have even two sequences as well-designed as what you'll see here, much less an entire film of them.The John Wick films also ooze style, with beautiful locations in Saudi Arabia, Japan, NYC, what appeared briefly to be London, and France. The lighting, particularly the Osaka scenes, is stunning. Stahelski is more than just an action director and knows how to make a gorgeous looking film that fills the big screen, where it should be seen.The John Wick films aren't supposed to be realistic, they're action-spectacle and stuntwork taken to its absolute limit. They exist in a parallel, comic book-universe, so I can waive any criticisms about lack of realism or the more out-there elements. Realism isn't the only point of action films, it's the intensity, the feeling watching it gives you, and the craft that goes into making it.Even the incidental kills John Wick does on nameless goons are well-choreographed. Nothing is lazy or done the easy way.Other action productions should be looking at this and sweating, because they've raised the bar yet again. In the next year or two, you're going to see a lot of choreography that will imitate this, and it won't quite ring as true, won't quite have the same authenticity.Kudos to Stahelski, Leitch, Keanu, and the rest of the incredible stunt team for piecing together a masterpiece of action. This could be a quality finishing point for the franchise, but would I be in the mood for another outing for Mr. Wick? To quote the man himself: \"....

At almost three hours in length, the picture does feel a little too long for its own good. At the same time, though, there isn't really anything specific that could be cut. I suppose the non-action elements could be tightened up slightly, as the plotting is undeniably a bit loose in the first half and none of the dialogue scenes come close to replicating the sheer awesomeness of those in the original. The story doesn't properly kick in until just under halfway through, actually. That's not to say the initial movement is especially bad in any significant way, just that it's where the pacing is at its least propulsive and is the one area that could've been trimmed slightly. Generally speaking, the narrative is about as successful as that of the third entry, except it has a higher level of thematic resonance and its characters undergo more distinct arcs. Once the plot kicks in proper, it's actually a really satisfying way of driving the action right the way through to the surprisingly poignant finale. In a deft move, the ending opts for suspense over exhilaration and is all the more impressive because of it, providing an edge-of-your-seat thrill that's especially subversive considering the relentless pacing of almost every other set-piece. Speaking of edge-of-your-seat thrills, the final hour of this is an absolute masterpiece. It represents action cinema at its finest, a series of near back-to-back gunfights, car chases, judo throws, dog attacks, stair climbs and tactical reloads. The earlier action is also fantastic, particularly a mid-point club sequence that features the series' most creative kill since the second chapter showed us what a pencil can do in the right hands, but this last movement is a veritably phenomenal slice of pure cinema, astounding in its pulse-pounding choreography and confident construction. The stunts are seriously impressive, and the comedic timings are equally as impeccable. Its sense of irony is what makes it as enjoyable as it is, breaking through the unbridled brutality of its protagonist's tireless kill spree to remind you that this is an intricate dance designed to entertain rather than horrify. It's ridiculous by choice, a gorgeously lit opera of violence that drops your jaw as often as it widens your eyes. The extended set-pieces always manage to last far longer than you expect them to without ever outstaying their welcome, evolving just when they threaten to feel obsolete. The sheer brilliance of it all is almost numbing; it's easy to forget just how amazing even the simplest of it truly is. The first few action scenes aren't as gripping as they potentially could be, primarily because the narrative doesn't take off until the halfway point (as I mentioned before). When everything finally comes together, though, it's absolutely divine. There's stuff here I never thought I'd see on screen, things that make even the most outrageous action of the previous pictures seem certifiably quaint. It's an absolute blast that only gets better the more I think about it.

The movie follows Wick as he tries to clear his name and defeat a new enemy, Marquis, who has taken over the High Table, the organization that rules the underworld. Along the way, Wick faces old friends and foes, travels across the globe, and engages in spectacular fight scenes.The movie is a feast for action fans, as it delivers some of the most impressive and inventive action sequences ever seen on screen. The choreography, cinematography, and sound design are all top-notch, creating a visceral and thrilling experience. Keanu Reeves is charismatic and convincing as Wick, showing both his physical prowess and his emotional vulnerability. The supporting cast is also excellent, with Donnie Yen, Laurence Fishburne, Hiroyuki Sanada, and Bill Skarsgard among the standouts.However, the movie is not without its flaws. The plot is thin and convoluted, relying on a lot of exposition and contrivances to move the story forward. The movie also suffers from being too long and overstuffed, as it tries to cram in too many characters, locations, and subplots. Some of the scenes drag on for too long, losing their impact and excitement. The movie also lacks a sense of finality, as it sets up potential spin-offs and sequels instead of giving a satisfying conclusion.Overall, John Wick 4 is a highly entertaining action film that showcases Keanu Reeves' star power and skill.

Obviously John is trying to get revenge over the high table, but John and other characters in the movie start to question where this path of revenge will take him. His death was done beautifully and got me emotional. Everyone in this movie was shockingly good. Literally, every performance, Donnie Yen stole the show, Ian McShane was incredible, Bill Skarsgard was fantastic and was very threatening, Shamier Anderson was also incredible in this movie. But obviously, Keanu Reeve's gave a stellar performance in this movie. Every scene is choreographed beautifully. Every action scene is even more memorable then the last, and each one is better than incredible. When you get to the final few action scenes, there are some of the greatest of all time. The pacing is fantastic, each act is distinct and different, and none of these scenes feel repetitive. I seriously don't get that complaint. The visuals are the best they have ever been in this franchise, and the visuals for the first one are incredibly underrated. The final battle between Caine and Wick have some of the best visuals I've ever seen. When John is dying in the sunrise, I was and am speechless.HOW ARE MOVIES THIS GOOD??? The score is as always incredible. I listen to the score for all of these movies all the time. It's one of those scores that just reminds you of how good the movie was. This movie stuck with me for the entire week when I first watched it, and now that I've rewatched it, I can't get it out of my head. It's that good. I've thought about this for a long time, but now I think I'm confident: This movie has the most entertaining action sequences of all time. Literally, I wasn't bored for a SINGLE SECOND! A SEEECCONND!!! I know that term get's thrown around a lot, but here, it's actually true. Literally, from the opening sequence, I was HOOKED. He's practicing his punches, and every punch, and every gunshot echoed across the room, and it provided for the best theater experience I've ever had. There were so many scenes in this movie where I got out of my seat, and wen't NUTS! There is also so much emotion in this movie, especially when you get to the end, my jaw was on the floor, but here, I actually mean it, there were so many scenes where I actually got teary eyed.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "One of the Greatest Action Movies of All Time", "date": "2023-04-15T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8995885"}, {"content": "Relentlessly long and with very few breaks in the action, the bladder-testing run time is not a major problem - several sequences could easily be cut with little threat to either what passes for plot or character development, but each individual sequence is so much fun that it seems almost churlish to criticise.

This is NOT debatable.Over the last years we got 4 movies and every single one of them was extraordinary. Action of a quality never seen before and always great stories around that. Powerful actors like Lance Reddick, Laurence Fishburne, Ian McShane, Bill Skarsgard and of course THE action hero KEANU REEVES.It may not be the longest action movie franchise (James Bond) or the most succesful (MCU) but it has the best action and therefore has to be the best ACTION franchise. The creativity and realism this action consists of is astonishing. The cinematography is always dark, but beautiful. Chapter 4 is in that case the best.But what makes this franchise unforgettable is its ending. First of all we got an ending, many action movie franchises did not find an acceptable ending or they are searching for it until today. But that is not the case for John Wick, because they concluded his story masterfully with this last entry. The whole movie is one last ride and therefore builds up tension so we get a huge payoff in the end.John Wick not only dominated the box office and completely destroyed Marvel's woke disaster called Ant-Man, it showed Hollywood how to make an entertaining and successfull blockbuster movie. Something we rarely get to see these days.With this said, John Wick Chapter 4 is definitely worth watching, Action fans have to see it and fans of blockbuster movies as well.And that all because someone killed his dog!", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "The master of action is back for ONE LAST RIDE", "date": "2023-04-15T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8994826"}, {"content": "This action movie is great, it's a way greater than all the previous plotless Wick's movies, it surely stands alone in the series. But, there is one huge BUT, there is a black spot in the middle of each frame, a black hole which intensely sucks and this hole is the John Wick and the hundred years old hairy wooden hippy playing John Wick - poor Mr. Reeves. Everything is totally WEAK about this character from his name to the person playing it. Firstly, Baba (Yaga) in Russian is a degrading word for \"woman\" equivalent to the words like wench, slut, broad, dame or hag if the woman is old and vicious which is the case of our Johny what makes him in plain English \"Hag Yaga\" - how stupid is that? Baba Yaga is a vicious old witch hag from Russian kids' folklore stories. It doesn't sound cool in relation to a coldblooded killerman, it sounds like Bubba Gump shrimp. It would be much coole to call him Kashchey the Deathless which is Voldemort/Sauron character from Russian folklore. And what is a Belorussian gypsy I'd like to ask the creators of this movie? There is no Romas or Gypsies in Belorussia only Hag Yaga - Lukashenko! Gypsies live in Moldova, West Ukraine, Romania, Hungary. The authors clearly don't know and don't care a damn what they are making the movie about! Ok, we can leave that alone. The worst part about this film isn't etymology anyway, but is that I laughed at every Mr. Weak's fight scene as bad as if I was watching Mr. Bean, and, believe me, that's not a good sign for an action packed dramatic serious shoot-em-up Kill-Bill movie. For the part of Wick with the same success they could have cast Adrian Brody straight from Polanski's Pianist. Old, stooping, bow-legged, hippy-looking, bearded and hairy Keanu Reeves is the worst cast an action film has ever known in the history of the world cinema! He should have played parts of scientists and musicians not roles of Steven Seagal. Every fight scene with Weak John looks crying-out fake. He doesn't mean it, he doesn't mean a single blow, he doesn't even try - he is OLD, he can't do martial arts and acrobatics and it's a torture to watch him trying. He doesn't produce an impression of lethal killer, he produces impression of a laughing stock, of a scarecrow on a stick. When I think how much time it is going to take the characters of Steven Seagal, Van Damme, Arny, Stallone, Jet Li, Jacky Chan or Black Mamba from Kill Bill to annihilate John to nanoparticles, my answer is from one to five seconds. You know how long would last a fight scene between Great John Weak and cleric John Preston from Equilibrium (2002)? - about one sec - and there would be three Johns Wicks. Even Charles' Angeles would beat all the dust out of poor Johny in ten seconds. The only main character from old action movies whom Weak John would confront without being killed instantly is John McLane. It would take about five minutes of some heavy fighting and a lucky chance for McLane to finish off the Weak one. All in all Keanu Reeves completely lacks what it takes to produce on screen the effect of a deadly threat, he only makes one laugh and pity him. It is clearly visible that when he throws some big bloke, it's not he who do the action, it's the stuntmen who jumps and sends himself flying, Keanu Reeves has little strength only to move his own hands and carcass through the air. Keira Knightley was wielding nunchucks better in Domino than this poor old superhero. And as an actor - he is not an actor, he is a log trying to look serious and menacing. In spite of all this said it's still a surprisingly good action movie from the old times mostly due to the good job of the rest of the crew.", "rating": 2, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 7}, "heading": "Poor old weak Johnny", "date": "2023-04-15T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8994788"}, {"content": "John Wick, Kane and Akira, Simazu, Killa, Tracar all is Great.

And honestly I really liked the previous movies, and I consider the first one to be one of the greatest action movies. But honestly, this 4th installment is just too much. I was at awe to see that it is now the most high-rated in the franchise and at the time that this review is written has an astonishing 8.2/10.First, it seemed like the plot went missing. Again, this is a John Wick movie, you don't need something elaborate, but at least you should put a minimum effort. Friendships appeared out of nowhere, and the viewer is supposed to accept that these friendships are so strong that they could influence the events. Sub-plots related to these friendships were built and then left like nothing happened.Second, one thing that this movie is praised is the almost non-stop action. To many people this seems like a positive. But honestly, the \"calm before the storm\" concept is something very useful to bring the viewer to the emotional status you want them, even in action movies. Here we didn't have this. Instead, we were bombarded with action scene after action scene, where John Wick should have died but didn't. And this fails to convey a fear. And after a while, all these action scenes appeared to be the same. There was a sequence towards the end which was different and more novel, which is appreciated. But apart from that everything was the same. Same moves, same choreography, people not dying when they should. John Wick is in constant danger and yet you don't fear for him for one second.Third, contrary to popular belief, the movie was way too long (between 2.5-3 hours), and there were instances that the length could be reduced without losing too much, even within the non-stop action concept adopted by the movie.

The most important is Donnie Yen as a blind former colleague of Wick forced out of retirement to hunt the protagonist down and the most fun is Shamier Anderson's \"Tracker\" who has a dog sidekick and is a prime candidate for a spin off. At the other end of the scale is The Marquis, the main villian of the piece. It's entertaining to see him pop up in ridiculously ostentatious locations throughout the film but his accent is ridiculous and any attempt at projecting menace is undermined by laughable dialogue. His response to a botched attempt to off Wick in a hotel is to say \"the goal was not to kill John Wick, it was to kill the idea of John Wick\", despite the fact the plan had definitely been to kill John Wick.Wannabe cool dialogue falling flat on its face is a recurring theme throughout the stretched runtime. Lawrence Fishbourne spouts the same style of nonsense as he does in the previous films and while there is an attempt to flesh out the character of Winston (presumably with incoming series \"The Continental\" in mind) his attempts to impart sage wisdom just highlight the fact that, apart from Ian McShane's natural gruff cool, there isn't anything to him. Towards the end of the movie Wick embarks on a mad dash through Paris (a cool idea which probably should have been the whole film) but this too is suffers from a lame attempt at cool in the form of an obnoxious Warriors reference. What fits in a 70's New York gang flick jars in modern day Paris.Chapter 4 does have some great action sequences, the stand out being a videogame inspired, overhead shoot out with Wick utilising a flamethrower shotgun and Reeves always shines when he is telling a story physically rather than through speech. The problem is there is just too much of everything. Too much rolling around shooting, too much using bullet proof jackets as a convenient way to extend fights and definitely too much high table, assassin tradition mumbo jumbo.

The impressive feat of the fourth film of a film franchise being this good is unheard of. Not only is it good, it may be the best one yet. Everything that I loved in the first three films are brought here, but the story and layers is so deep, the characters are legitimately compelling. The stakes keep getting raised, the tension tightens as the films progress. Violence is still just as brutal as the first. I'm feeling emotional towards some of the characters outside of John Wick which means the side characters are really good. And yet all of this began after a foolish child killed Wick's dog. However at this point, it's gone beyond just a revenge tale. Now, it's all about survival, the insurmountable obstacles John Wick has to endure to achieve ultimate redemption and finally peace. That's why these films work, because we are all still routing for Wick to make it through and maybe find solace. With that said, the things that also work have to do with Stahelski's amazing direction for someone who was a stuntman is very impressive. Reeves has embedded this character into his own being so much it's now so iconic for him much like what Indiana Jones did for Harrison Ford. Donnie Yen comes in and steals all the scenes he's in, and a great addition to the Wick franchise, creating even more possibilities of where this can go. Clancy Brown makes a welcomed appearance and make the most of his screen time like the true veteran actor he is. Ian McShane and Laurence Fishburne complete the cast of solid side characters and both give great performances in this as well. The only reason why this has an 8/10 is because of the runtime. The other films were short and sweet and were effective without the long runtime. This did feel like it dragged on at parts. Nothing that derailed the whole thing or anything, but broke some of the momentum the film built up but luckily the great scenes brought me right back.

Well, I didn't watch the prequels. So, perhaps I may be missing the true core value of this flick. Who knows ...First, the plot summary: People are getting killed over and over and over again. That's it. End of story. Period.Yet, for what cause do they fight? So, they just hate each other?? ... or love each other? Hundreds of them? And they all just die in seconds? Where did all these fighters get their training from? How did they all master such training if they all die on a fast lane in the end?For John & friends it doesn't seem sufficient to just immobilize their enemies and continue to deal with another person. Oh no, way off the mark! They compulsively must return to every seriously wounded person and finish him/her off while already \"serving\" their next slaughter victim ...Actually, while watching the movie I couldn't fail to get the impression that I was barely audiencing a rendition of some gamer who is playing a first person shooter computer game. The plot didn't have any deeper sense than that at all. No goal to achieve other than killing everybody until John & friends were the last men standing. During the fight scenes I was from time to time looking out for a game score in the corners of the screen.Considering the stunts:\nThe flick was advertised for its great fight scenes. So, well - I came expecting ... great fight scenes. But what did I get: CGI fights. Animated computer characters fighting animated computer characters. How much more boredom can be portrayed than barely watching computer characters fight each other.Anyone glorifying the fight seens here in his/her reviews: So, you don't recognize a plain CGI rendering when you're watching it? Really?? - So, you didn't recognize all the unnatural character movements during fights or shootings? You didn't recognize or realize that the whole Place Charles de Gaulle scene was a computer animation with no man nor dog nor any car being recorded in reality? You plainly have been watching a bloody computer rendering on a large screen and failed to recognize??These unnatural rubber toy, superball movements of the CGI characters during fight scenes kept me wondering if I had accidentally visited one of those dreadful poorly computer animated Marvel flicks.Well, I guess it should be clear to everyone that no-one ... I repeat: NO-ONE by far could have survived any of these fight scenes. John Wick would have died multiple times: Fully hit by a car, but suffering no harm, huh? Falling down the stairs hundreds of meters, but he's fine and immediately continuing to fight. Or he's crashing into another car unbelted. The car is broken, yet John is left uninjured - yeah, sure ...Honestly, I'm a person who wants to believe. Yet, there is a limit that's being reached when it comes to a certain degree of incredibility. Now, that limit of credibility has by far been exceeded by this flick.Next, the musical score was a true disappointment. It didn't convey any emotion. It just played some metal licks, being strung together, or boring loops that have been played.By the way: What sense does it make for this decade's professional radio station to play vinyl records or multi-track tapes from a tape recorder?Last but not least: Character depictions were shallow.

This is the best film of 2023, already. There I said it. It's already the best film of 2023. John Wick's Chapter 4 is one of the best action films this decade. I enjoy this film, no; I loved this film. I loved this film, My dad and I watched John Wick's Chapter 1 on opening day, and now we watched it on opening day; and Chapter 4 didn't disappoint us at all; we had the best time with this film. Bill Skarsgard, Donnie Yen, and Scott Adkins were brilliant in this film, and they didn't disappoint us in this film as it's such a good plot during this film. The story is well done as it shows and expands the new assassin world. And the action, I can keep going on and on about the action and I am so anticipated that I want to see the movie again, of how good the action is especially the overhead scene that was inspired by Hotline Miami. That scene alone made this film a masterpiece. I could watch it over and over again and I will never get tire of watching it. The story is really good and the ending was a huge plot twist, as we though there were going to make Chapter 5. And in all honesty if they end the story here with John Wick, that would be okay, because, I seriously don't know how on god's earth will they top this film. And If they ever do a Chapter 5, Please bring everybody back that did Chapter 1-4 for Chapter 5. My dad and I are huge fans and we will continue be fans, we love the film and for my dad it's already the best film of 2023 in his eyes. Cinematography, soundtrack, visuals are ALL astounding. There is only a nitpick and that is John Wick still is clean after all the fighting. Overall, John Wick's Chapter 4 is a true masterpiece of action filmmaking. It's a film that manages to exceed the high bar set by its predecessors, delivering a thrilling and emotionally engaging experience that leaves you wanting even more. If you're a fan of action movies or just great filmmaking in general, then John Wick Chapter 4 is an absolute must-see film. I give it a 10/10 rating without reservation. I am wanting this film to get this film a billion dollars at the box office, Because it deserves the money, and time to see on the BIG screen. I am going to see this film over and over again.

He lives in Paris, and all business meetings and pivotal plot points take place exclusively in (amazingly empty) touristy landmarks.

And there were lots and lots of Action scenes. All the actions scenes were well thought out, well shot and properly executed. There is no denying the fight scenes came together excellently.Problem is, I feel they focused so much on perfecting the action scenes that it took away from the underlying concept of John Wick.John Wick the one known as the Babayaga, feared the boogeyman, a mythical man who's name shouldn't be uttered. A man who got out for Love, lived his life and who later lost the love of his life to disease, found some hope in a puppy gifted from his said love and then.. Well, we all know the rest...The last installment had so many gaps or ommissions. John hardly speaks, no real conversations happen, no new quirky witty sayings.Even going after the high table starts in the dessert and then ends as quick as it starts - this after almost the whole 3rd installment was set on finding the high table in the dessert...? They don't show who the high table is, he doesn't even get close to them...? Not even in New York. After all this, he just ends up killing the representation of the High table - again. What happened to 'Winston, tell them.. I'm coming, I'm going to kill them all..'The guy with the dog - what was his back story? The whole time I thought he was sent by John's friend from the 3rd movie, ie Hailey Berry, to look out for John. But no, they wrote this guy in as a new character looking for a certain pay day. The story just didn't fit.The opponent was like a Harry Styles version of a villain. There was no way that guy could be a high table representative.. It made no sense.The scene where he stabs the tracker guy in the hand just didn't feel realistic. It felt like if the tracker guy stabbed him back in the hand and asked him to show him what kind of man he is, he (representative) would've passed out. It felt like he was all glamour and no grit.Talking about dogs, John not once spends any time with his dog in the whole movie. They bring the dog in the end of the movie, but never with John. How could this be? Johns dog is an essential part of Johns character, his humanity. How did they miss this?The King of the streets, also had such little airtime. They don't show how he helps John other than bring him his cavalier suit. There was so much more to him they could've brought into the story, but didn't.Johns friend, who gives him refuge dies at the hand of Caine, but why? It made no sense to kill him off. Then they leave the story of the daughter who asks John to avenge her father's death hanging in the air. It was so unnecessary.I did still enjoy the movie but am saddened by the fact they ended it the way they did. I expected a lot more, and not the measly 2 minute unalive scene they gave him.There was so much potential they missed... The high table could've offered John a seat at the table, and we see him either reject it or work his way through it from the inside..", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Lots of Action, but where's the Babayaga?", "date": "2023-04-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8979339"}, {"content": "John Wick is definitely one of the best franchises in history - it was before this movie, but it's gotten even better after this one. The action pieces, the cinematography, the score, the costumes, the guns, the world, it's all there. I don't think I need to go into this review to explain why John Wick movies are good. What I want to explain is why this one is far and away the best one.The other movies themselves were really good, but things held them back. I gave the first two an 8, for different reasons. The first John Wick was an excellent take on revenge films, but that also held it back by having to do what those movies did. There is less an emphasis on the assassin stuff and more on John Wick's life and people telling him not to get back in etc. It's not a big deal but the movie would much better focusing on other stuff. John Wick 2 did exactly that, but the overall story was just so non existent that I didn't particular care what John Wick was doing. John Wick 3 struck a good balance - i gave it a 9, it was great. The only downside to me was the ending, it just felt like the movie ended exactly where it started, and that the franchise was just going to keep going on and on.John Wick 4 just outmatches them in every respect. For starters, this has the highest budget i believe, and you can tell. The locations are beautiful, and even small scenes are devoted to well constructed sets or real locations, and it gives the movie a visual intrigue that keeps the viewer engaged even when not that much is happening. And similar to the last movie, I love how we're just fully in this world now. Unlike a lot of these action movies where the movie wants to tell us it's in the real world or silly action world, John Wick sets itself solely in its own world, where people can get cars and shake it off.And the action - wow. This is nearly a 3 hour movie which I thought is weird for an action movie... then you realise about 2 hours of that is straight action. The action is not paced evenly, it mainly comes out in chunks, there's three big ones which consist of all these different moments and bits, and also lead into other sets and characters. While that has the chance of not working and keeping a consistent pace, or just being mind numbing, in John Wick 4 the action is always varying itself up. I feel like John Wick spends 15 minutes in this glass light room but the movie keeps the camerawork and choreography varied that it feels as though it's not just repeating itself, and also that John has to think of new ways on the fly to get himself out of the fights in a way that is quick and fun. The amount of memorable parts is staggering, and it's what keeps this above the others in my mind. I remember scenes definitely, but i can't remember half an hour of just the most creative, fluid, thrilling action.And yes, this is the last John Wick. I went into this movie not knowing that, but feeling as though it needed to happen. It really helps this movie, because there's this epic feeling this movie has because of it. Early on it begins to be apparent. Once the hotel blows up, you know that things are probably going to rap up. But how? I didn't know, which was also exciting. In a lot of these movies I know John Wick and the previous characters couldn't die, but here it's less apparent, and they do kill off people.The thing that got me most in this movie is just how everything has been upgraded, and by that I mean the feel. The most memorable scene to me was the scene in the club after the card game. It's similar to a scene in John Wick 2, but these sorts of gun fights in clubs happen in every movie. What's different is both the scale, and how stylized it is. In John Wick 2 pretty early on everyone gets scared and runs away. Here it isn't until the moment when it's over do people really get scared, and it's almost surreal. Combine that with how the action, while it has rules that make it work, are probably physically inaccurate. I mean bullet proof protection is not that strong. And the amount of water coming out in that party. But it's not silly - the movie dedicates itself to this, and doesn't make jokes despite all the fun its having. That's what John Wick is. It's over the top, but grounded in its world so that you feel engaged in the spectacle. That's why this franchise is great, and it's all exemplified in this movie.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Going Out with a Bang", "date": "2023-04-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8979150"}, {"content": "The scenes left me in awe and I really really loved the story line.

It was the same basic plot line as the first three: Without giving away more than just the very beginning of number 4, number 3 ends with John Wick going on the run. Then number 4 starts with John Wick killing The Elder in Morocco.Then, surprise, surprise, the high table wants him dead yet again - just like in the earlier movies. Then a lot of fighting ensues - just like in the earlier movies. Then John Wick defeats them all without even getting wounded - just like in the earlier movies.\"Chapter 4\" is pretty much just like the other movies: A very basic plot line and a lot of fighting. They've already made three movies like that, so why do we need another? I found \"Chapter 3\" to be the weakest in the series. It was overly long and just a lot of boring, long fights without much plot. At least \"Chapter 4\" is slightly better than \"Chapter 3\", but not by much. Granted, \"Chapter 4\" might be the best film in the series, but number 1 and 2 are pretty much just as good. I did also feel that \"Chapter 4\" didn't feel as long or drawn out as \"Chapter 3\", despite actually being longer, so I have to give them credit for that.Nevertheless, the film was all in all pretty much a throwaway, unless you think watching three hours of fight scenes is the epitome of cinema.One particular aspect needs special mention though, which is Keanu Reeves' acting:\nI haven't watched many of his films, which hasn't been a conscious choice, but he's sometimes mentioned as one of those somewhat typical Hollywood cases: Good-looking person who can't act.\"Chapter 4\" is quite possibly the worst acting I've seen from him. Keanu didn't say much in this movie, and almost every time he did, I almost started laughing, as his lines were just delivered in a ridiculously poor manner, especially if he was in a gruelling situation.Ian McShane and Laurence Fishburne were great, as always, but Keanu Reeves was terrible.

However if you dig these films, oh boy you're in for a treat.I will say that in the story/plot department, this movie is certainly a bit thin and the narrative comes through in slightly inconsistent waves, but don't get me wrong there is some really good 'stuff' here in the story. Admittedly, I'm a bit of a curmudgeon when it comes to writing/ story in media, but when it comes to John Wick 4 I just don't even care.

As always Hollywood's humble hero, Mr. Reeves, does outstanding and should inspire us all to be healthy and get in the gym!The people behind this franchise deserve so much credit and admiration in my opinion.

John Wick--played once again by the reclusive Keanu Reeves--is battered, punched, kicked, stabbed and shot to the brink of unbearable exhaustion. At one point in the movie, he can't even stand up. But he does, fighting through the pain--and that makes him more impressive and inspiring than a guy single-handedly eliminating an army of thugs and coming out squeaky clean on the other side.\"Chapter 4\" continues where the previous one left off. But while \"Parabellum\" jumped right into its action-driven rhythm, here the movie likes to take its time settling in through provocative and luxurious imagery showcasing the opulence and grandeur of its criminal underworld whose leaders--known as The High Table--exercise their power without mercy. While the movie's self-centered presentation serves to impose its authority on the viewer and to make them aware just how deeply-rooted, ancient and powerful the men coming after Wick are, they also linger for a bit too long, stretching towards a sense of narcissism and slowing the movie down too much.But this is not what I am going to focus on when I talk about \"John Wick: Chapter 4\", nor anyone should.Instead, let's talk about the bravura choreography of the action scenes, arguably the greatest ever put to film. This franchise had three previous movies before this one, and each one pushed the boundaries more and more, perfecting the craft of the stuntman who is often overlooked. Here, this craft is elevated to an art form through elaborate camerawork and physical skill whose pace is rival to a dancing act. The action scenes are long, brutal, twisted, clever, complex, using the environment they are in to angular precision. After one such scene finishes, we feel both tired and satisfied, sharing Wick's moments of rest and relief. Some people complained that the action scenes are too long, but when executed like this, that's like complaining that a comedy is too funny.But while action is the foundation on which John Wick is built, don't think for a second that the quiet moments in-between are just filler. Stahelski and his writers Shay Hatten, Michael Finch and Derek Kolstad know that a movie is more than a pretty face. Sure, Wick is a man of few words, Reeves playing him with a grounded sense of modesty; but when he talks, people listen. In one particular scene, both him and his rival Caine (Donnie Yen)--an assassin forced by the High Table to kill Wick and an old friend of his--sit down in a church and contemplate on the existence of God. The movie would have worked without this scene as well, and the discussion is not more philosophical than it has to be, but in between such heavy mounds of action, it offers a sense of peace and serenity that hits just right.

I'm certain it is mostly the crew and their family/friends that upvoted this garbage.What was wrong with this film:Plot: the plot, like in most action films, is paper thin. Like most other reviewers have stated, you forget why he's doing what he's doing. This film had NOTHING to do with the first three, which is part of the reason of the success of the franchise. Nothing from the 3rd film was answered in this 4th rendition. What happend with Winston and Keanu from JW3? Why was nothing talked about. It's almost like writers retconned that whole scenario and it detracted from the movie. In the beginning of the film, JW kills the guy who heads the table. Kinda pointless, this should've been the climax of the film.The rest of the plot involved him going to random places to do random things, with action embodying the pacing throughout the film. His motivation was non-existent. If this was supposed to be the final film, why didn't Wick go after the bosses that have spots in the High Table? Why was he chasing after, or getting chased after by, the Marquis. The guy was a small fry compared to the High Table.The comedy was terrible as was the delivery. I was confounded in the theatre when people laughed at the \"dog bites nuts\" bit. We saw that JW3 with better taste.Acting/Characters: The acting is legit garbage. From Neo to Morpheus. It was over the top, and it looked like Neo learned his lines that day. Keanu's delivery was painful to witness. I was embarrassed I paid for the premium seating to watch this movie. Winston and Morpheus didn't care about this film and it showed. They would say a few lines then poof, disappear from the movie. This killed what little pacing the movie displayed outside of the action scenes.Although the film tried to make you care about the new comers, it failed miserably. There was no character development, just bits and pieces of information for the viewer to piece together to understand why they were placed in the film. The guy with the dog was a pointless addition. The antagonist was pointless as well.The blind warrior has been done to death, and JW4 defiled the grave. We don't care about him because he's a pointless addition to the movie to showcase \"eastern\" style fighting. He offers nothing to the plot. We don't care about his backstory, but we're forced to view it, because it's apparent he and that hot Japanese chick will be back in the 5th movie or the series.The Action: it was comical and sad. Keanu just can't do what he did 3 or 4 years ago and it shows with every fight scene he's in. If you actually paid attention to the moves that the other actors performed while fighting with Keanu, you can see where they wait for him to perform his set, and join the dance accordingly. It was painful to watch Keanu try to do the outlandish moves that he performed in the first 3 entries of this series. Every time he was in a fight scene, his sluggish movements just took me out of the movie and made me impatient.The Setting:\nPart of the success of this franchise is how the setting was ever widening with each new movie. The first movie we got a glimpse of his time with the Russian Mafia. The second movie we see there is an intricate web of different crime bosses that have formed a collective of control on a world wide scale. The third movie furthered this notion of world wide control as John seeks the man above the table to redeem his life.The fourth movie did nothing to help evolve the setting. Sure we see a lot of nice prints of different locations, but what does that have to do with the overall arc of the franchise? Nothing. We're taken to different locations for arbitrary reasons and the director expects the audience to oh and ah over the cinematography.The Realism:\nGoing into an action film, I think we, as an audience, understand that reality is loosely based. This film took it to another level. The director and writers rip us out of the movie when John falls 4 stories and walks it off, gets hit by 5 cars going at least 30+ mph and gets up to dust off his coat, and falls down over 200+ STONE stairs and cracks his back to start his ascend in the final act.What Hollywood doesn't realize is that in order for this kind of fantasy to work, it has to be within a certain genre of film or literature. Just like I wouldn't want to see Harry Potter doing some Calc problems, because magical fantasy ya know? I expect John to be hurt at some point when surviving bone shattering and organ expoding injuries.Overall, this film sucked from start to finish.

We get the required goods here, Donnie Yen's addition to the cast also adds to the experience. He not only delivers the choreography but he does it with a flair that stands out (he's also helped along by playing a pretty unique character). There's all the requisite bangs and cracks and it still looks impressive and gives you what you want. (my favourite was the set piece with the birds eye view). The plausible deniability is pulled pretty thin (John Wick is apparently immune to damage after being hit by a car) but it was in the other movies as well, I just noticed it more.John Wick didn't reintroduce us to Keeanu but it certainly helped catapult him back into the spotlight. John's a quiet character that relies more on his fists and his pistols to flip people to his point of view than his words. He's also an unkillable force of nature but both things are equally true. Keeanu still has the required gravitas to make our brooding master hitman tick and he's consistent with his performance in Chapter 4. Donnie Yen steals the show in my opinion, he's playing a more expressive and off-kilter character and he strikes a nice balance between serious and animated. Ian Mcshane returns as Winston, he's a great performer and he's got a magnetic screen presence. He's a needed anchor for this movie and he helps play up the stakes. Laurence Fishburne returns briefly as the Bowery King, he's doing the same kind of thing but he brings some badly needed levity. It was sad seeing Lance Reddick make his final appearance, he was always an underrated part of this franchise and he will be sorely missed. I wish we had gotten to see more of Rina Sawayama, she was great in her small amount of screen time. Wrapping up with Bill Skarsgard, he's fine as the Marquis but I wish he had been given more to chew on as the villain. He's a really capable actor and while he fits the bill, I couldn't help but feel he could have done more in Chapter 4 to make us really root for John in this battle, but he seemingly lacked the opportunity.If you're being given a similar flick and you enjoyed the previous entries, you should be satisfied right? I left the theatre content but I was actually a little disappointed. I didn't think there was much new included here or I didn't feel like they did as much to try and raise the bar. I get why Chapter 3 was more contentious film than the previous entries but I'm a little surprised at all the unconditional love Chapter 4 has gotten. To me it felt like just more of the same from Chad Stahelski and his team. It's the same environments, the same kind of characters are introduced and minus a couple of small instances, the same kind of setpieces. Their output is sufficient here but I couldn't help but want more from Chapter 4.John Wick: Chapter 4 delivers more of the same and if that's what you're primarily interested in, I think you'll leave the theatre satisfied. This is still a solid action movie, but some of the spellbinding affect melted away in this entry for me. The same kind of environments, characters and plot just left me shrugging my shoulders. It's not any better or any worse in almost any respect, I just noticed the machinations behind the curtain more and more. I still would be interested in another movie and hopefully The Continental TV show that's been in development for a while comes out soon.

Lance sadly passed away a few weeks prior to the release of the final chapter, they honored him as well as he honored his roll. Despite it's violent nature, the movie promotes heavy moral values such as unconditional Love, True friendship, Honor, Respect,and the concept of Fealty.Retrospectively...yeah...I was literally on the edge of my seat the entire time.

That helped a wee bit.The all out shooting and action takes place in the very centre of a very well populated (and well policed!) Paris ... yet no authorities turn up at all? Anywhere?Where are all the people?!? How do they manage to get some of the busiest tourist spots in Paris to themselves to have a grand meeting in front of the Eiffel Tower and a duel in front of the Sacre Coeur? I've been to these places and they're not quiet...!How does Wick survive multiple multi-story falls that would kill ... or at least severely injure someone ... and then just get up and run away? But one wee bullet in the tummy finishes him off? After all this? Please.It was nice to see a kinda LOST reunion happening ... with Mr Abadon, Mr Friendly and Dogan all in this film.If this is the direction that the franchise was going then I'm kindof glad it's the last one.

The first was undoubtedly the best- it was simple, realistic, unintentionally humourous and had a very clear goal. Then, it became a little over the top in the third, especially when he visited the elder and wanted to remain alive just so he \"could remember her\".Huh.Anyway, I had high expectations walking into the fourth instalment because I do love this franchise. However, it was far too much. The action sequences were shot well and choreographed fantastically but it was unrealistic even for a made believe world. Unless that was what they were going for? More of a Marvelesque/graphic 300 and Sin City- Zac Snyder type vibe? It was no doubt beautiful in terms of Sets, costumes and cinematography and ok, really do have to hand it to the stunt and action choreography team.. if there was an Oscar's category for stunts and fights, they will take it.Unfortunately, no amount of ornaments are going to save a movie with a lack of story. The acting here and dialogue delivery is pretty weak... I was also confused with the motivation. I understand Winston and John's friendship but then again, why is he so hell bent on surviving? John hates the trade, he's out then he's in, then he's in with such a goal to survive but for what reason? So then he's back in and wanting to die ...with honour? It seems out of character to want to get people he cares about involved and die for him and he doesn't even know why he wants to live so bad and run from the high table ... then later, he's in the game again to take revenge for his Japanese friend but then doesn't end up avenging him in the end, the guys daughter had to do it herself. Look, I want to say something prolific and sound like a great movie critic but I'm not. So I'm going to just jump in here into the sea of 9s and perfect 10 reviews and hope I can land like John wick after rolling down 20 flights of stairs and not die.I actually went into micro sleep at the 2hr mark because it was too much action. I know, it's crazy. But I woke up because an old couple had to pass me as they were walking out. They shook their heads, I think they were ready for some quiet tea and snacks.Hey, you know what peeves me, is that john travels from Osaka to new York then to some other paris and no one kills him on the plane or even the airport? In air, there's no where to go, they would defo be able to kill him in the airplane toilet of even disguise as a hot flight attendant and spike his drink. Also, the blind guy is better than so many other assassins... also, they used the same freaking dog antics as Halle berry but with a black guy that's randomly introduced for fan service or something. Also, i totally saw it coming at the end, as if John will kill Donnie yen. But then they went back to the black guy while he's sitting there drinking beer with his dog and he's like \"that was good/smart\" and I'm like \"whut, no it's nhat\".And like if you love your dog, you wouldn't be feeding it beer.. hello?Then also, John fell from buildings and got shot up and is almost immortal. But at the end he just dies from a gunshot wound in his liver with no will to live. He says \"Winston, take me home\", then Winston is like \"yea ok\". But he doesn't even run after him, he just lets John walk down the steps and he dies. But like now he has no will to live? I thought his goal was to live to remember her. If anything, this should've happened in John wick 2, where he gives in after avenging his puppy and getting his car back, then should lie in the sunset to die and reunite with Helen.Argh but nope he \"dies\". But then the Lionsgate production team realised what a hit this installment was and decides to do a number 5 and 6. So I guess John faked his death and then now comes out of hiding wants to avenge Donnie Yen or the Samurai dude, then they introduce jet li or Jackie Chan and omg it's going to be real Expendables type thing, brainless popcorn flick where everyone just fights real good fight scenes with explosions and falls, fire, snow ice and stuff, lots of injuries, cuts, bloods, 10000 stunt extra deaths, but the main guys limp but still fight with 100% blows and no one dies. Then the ending finally the bad guy has a real dramatic death with flowers and slow music and then John wick is like struggling but saves the day and says \"yeah\".Ok rant over. Oh well, guess i will watch John wick 5 anyway just to see how bad it is.

It felt fresh and new and had a convincing anti-hero with an understandable motivation. It was able to built up the necessary atmosphere of tension and suspense. A truly fun watch.Over the course of the of three sequels all that is left are stylised fight choreographies mixed with an overubandance of CGI. The general visual style throws any claim to realism over board. There is no more grounding in reality. Berlin and Paris look like comic book versions of real places that aren't inhabited by real people any more. No-one cares about a shooting in a night club or in the middle of parisian traffic at night. This could come across as an interesting artistic choice but there is no purpose to these stylistic decisions other than to make everything seem artificial and detached. On top of all of that, Wick seems almost invincible throughout the movie.And it makes the action feel impactless besides all the effort that went into the fights and shootouts.And it makes us care even less for this protagonist that has lost any sense of drive or goal. Why is he still doing what he's doing? Don't know... Should I care? It wouldn't hurt.This way the viewer gets the impression of watching a three hour demonstration of what modern Hollywood can achieve in terms of action and effects (with the occasional weak cgi background).John Wick now feels like a franchise movie that pushes on some of the strength of the original but forgets about the things that made us care in the first place.

It's almost three hours of an unbroken chain of jaw-droppingly silly fight scenes that do amount to some entertainment; but fall a fair distance short of coherent storytelling.This is Keanu Reeves indulging in Jackie Chan fight scene fantasies, minus the legendary martial arts extravaganza of Chan. Instead, Wick presents more of a Chuck Norris or Schwarzenegger brute force; he's all bite no bark, letting out the occasional \"Yeah,\" to affirm his next killing spree as a one-man army.And the onslaught really rarely stops for a breather. You could go out for a piss, make a sandwich, do a shopping run and return to quite probably the same fight scene. It's like being waterboarded with the same relentless \"dodge, reload mag, headshot\" sequence.Wick really miraculously dodges a million bullets (a Matrix throwback?), and finds himself fighting, incidentally, in a succession of stunning locations across Paris - where the gendarmerie is nowhere to be seen. But maybe that's a string-pull of The High Table? The film seldom explains itself. Oftentimes, in other areas we see robotic extras as unreactive crowds (nightclub scene). In general, the city doesn't feel like a city, rather a playground for well, John Wick & co. It could be lifted from Grand Theft Auto with how shallow the French metropolis feels here.The Le Chiffre-style crime boss, the \"Marchese\" (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd) gives spades of unlikeable sartorial snobbery that's easy to rally against behind the absolute battering ram in John Wick. But the interplay between the characters doesn't amount to much more than grunts, braggadocio, wry smiles, and \"I'm gonna kill you, mate.\"There are other characters too, sidelined by Wick but there on the fringe as sort of cheerleaders. Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), Winston (Ian McShane), and Caine (Donnie Yen) are memorable, but sort of just \"there\".By now, four instalments in, and with lackluster closure, the candle really has burned to the wick.

To be honest, at this point, the franchise feels a bit tired.I get that these movies aren't really about the plot, but the extended universe around Wick is what makes them interesting and it's been like that from the start. Take away the shadowy underground world of the assassins, and the first movie is a generic revenge film with great action sequences. Every instalment since then has upped the ante and introduced new stuff to flesh out this world. This movie seems to plateau a bit in that regard.That being said, there is a lot to like in Chapter 4. We're introduced to new - and admittedly fun - characters like Donnie Yen's Caine and Shamier Anderson's \"Hunter - and awesome locations: from Osaka to Berlin to Paris. There are some truly incredible action sequences here: the whole Berlin club scene is - Chef's Kiss - exquisite and highlights the best thing most of these movies do: give us fantastic nightclub fight scenes. The overheard, extended one take in the building, with John shooting incendiary shotgun rounds is absolutely incredible and the best scene of the film, in my opinion. The staircase scene is a great, fun, and truly ludicrous sequence, one that is so unrealistic, you can't help but laugh.However, on the plot side of things, John Wick has never felt more like a video game, with literal mini bosses punctuating the various \"levels\" of the movie. I never really felt emotionally invested, knowing that John can take literally any amount of damage and his plot armour will protect him. It's that lack of tension that was first a feature, and now feels like a bug.Speaking of Mr. Wick, I have to say, Keanu Reeves was pretty bad in this movie. Not in terms of his stunt performance or the physicality, but literally in terms of his acting. I know this is not a popular take, I know he has a certain way of acting in these movies, I'm not dumb. But, I can't help but feel he doesn't really know what tone he's supposed to be hitting with his (very few) lines in this movie.But, he's not the worst actor. That would have to go to Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, whose \"French\" character - Marquis Vincent de Gramont (real name) - has perhaps the worst, most unconvincing, annoying accent I have heard in a LONG TIME. Why they couldn't just hire a French actor is beyond me; Jean Reno should've played this character, we all know it. He's not just an unconvincing villain, but a bafflingly stupid one at that.By the end of Chapter 4, I was exhausted.

The old saying \"too much of a good thing is a bad thing\" holds true for this movie.I rewatched the first John Wick when I got home from the theater yesterday and it clearly showed to me how much John Wick 4 had strayed from the first one.Many of you may enjoy John Wick 4, but unfortunately experience was not.", "rating": 4, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 7}, "heading": "Action, yes...story, no.", "date": "2023-04-02T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8967363"}, {"content": "So while I would highly recommend seeing this film in the theaters I would like to state what I thought did and didn't work.First, the action scenes and fighting choreography was great, but there is sometimes too much of a good thing.

When I read that it was near close to a three hour run time, that's exactly what I was expecting!Instead, they introduce a NEW, singular, villain -from seemingly nowhere; Two NEW old friends of John; and a NEW random assassin who has a pet/partner German shepherd assassin. This last one had to be a ploy to incorporate more of the action sequences from chapter 3.

In fact, there are some that are major loose ends. The adjudicator from 3, Cassius from chapter 2, Aurelio from chapters 1&2, the head of Ruska Roma from ch.3 (the closest John has to a mother/family), and John Wicks own Pit bull ....

A couple characters (Winston being one of them) actually point this out, and John Wick's only answer is, \"I'm going to kill them.\" But that doesn't solve his problem: the High Table isn't just going to stop.Second, i was IMMENSELY disappointed that Lawrence Fishburn did not have a more central role in this chapter. The ending of Chapter 3 suggested that this vendetta and war against the High Table was as much his as it was John Wick's. It would certainly have made for a far more interesting plot to have the Bowery King's forces join with his royal counterpart in Paris or Berlin or Osaka or wherever in order to fight The High Table.And lastly, the fight scenes were quite ... well, boring. Just the same shoot-shoot-shoot, thrust, stab, flip enemy over shoulder, shoot or stab until dead. Then repeat ad nauseum.Also, John Wick is not a superhero with mutant superpowers. When he falls 30 feet and lands hard on his midsection, he should be hurt. Badly. Or even be dead.

While \"John Wick: Chapter 4\" does not retreat from the mythology the series has created, it really stops the expansion and returns to a relatively streamlined plot and a manageable set of characters.It may seem ridiculous to call a three hour film streamlined, but this film more than earns it's run time by creating a series of epic action sequences that are some of the best ever committed to film. These sequences are long ... very very long ... but they are never less than utterly engaging. They tell stories in miniature and are wonderfully tense and dynamic.

I felt after a stellar start, it was a bit too long and some of the repetition in the fights was a bit wearing. It's interesting about the way movies work, that I too felt this was overlong, and repetitive, but it ends (rather than starts) with such a phenomenal series of action moments that I feel much better about it than I did the last one.With John Wick (Keanu Reeves) touring the world damaging the reputation of \"The Table\", they task The Marquis Vincent De Gramont (Bill Skarsgard) with finally bringing him to heel. Having extracted a terrible revenge on The New York Continental, Gramont blackmails blind assassin, and former friend of Wick, Caine (Donnie Yen) to hunt him down. Now a serious liability to his friends, Winston (Ian McShane) comes forward with a plan to free Wick from his debts once and for all.I think I'd actually go as far as to describe the first two thirds of the movie as being lacklustre. It's only really Donnie Yen's reluctant killer that offers anything that we haven't seen before. Much of those earlier scenes seen Wick killing hordes of heavily shielded enemies, so again, as with the third one, the bullets are more to stun people rather than kill them outright. The Marquis sees Skarsgard, play aristocratic villain, which again the series has done before, though not perhaps with someone struggling as much with the accent as he is.There are some raw moments with Lance Reddick in these early scenes too, who, as ever, was great.The last third though, from the moment he steps out of the subway into Paris and battles across the city is phenomenal. It's a breathless action scene that lasts around 45 minutes, barely pausing for a moments respite. It seems him use cars, motorbikes, and all sorts of the weaponry to fend off assassins sent to stop him reaching a certain destination and it really makes great use of Paris as a character in the action. I must say, the scenes when he uses \"Dragons Fire\" bullets is perhaps the most video game thing I've seen a movie do. All the earlier inertia is blown away by perhaps the best sequence the series has ever done, and I do think that I probably feel warmer about the film because it ends with it's best sequence, whereas Parabellum opened with it.I think I'm happy for the story of John himself to end here.

Basically, in New York City, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is hiding underground with the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne) and is preparing to exact revenge against the High Table. He travels to Morocco and kills the Elder (George Georgiou), the \"one who sits above the Table\". In response, New York Continental hotel manager Winston (Ian McShane) and his concierge, Charon (Lance Reddick, posthumously), are summoned by the Marquis Vincent de Gramont (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd), a member of the High Table. De Gramont explains that the High Table has given him unlimited resources to find and kill John Wick. To punish Winston for his failure to assassinate John, De Gramont strips him of his duties as manager, declares him \"excommunicado\", destroys the Continental, and kills Charon. De Gramont then travels to Paris, France and hires blind, retired High Table assassin Caine (Donnie Yen) to kill John, his old friend, threatening to murder Caine's daughter otherwise. John takes refuge at the Osaka Continental, run by his friend Shimazu Koji (Hiroyuki Sanada). De Gramont's right-hand man Chidi (Marko Zaror), backed by High Table assassins and Caine, arrives to investigate the hotel. Shimazu's daughter Akira (Rina Sawayama), the hotel's concierge, evacuates all guests and staff before the High Table \"deconsecrates\" it, igniting a large-scale fight. John fights through numerous armed assassins and ends up in a showdown with Caine. They are interrupted by a bounty hunter who calls himself \"Mr. Nobody\", aka The Tracker (Shamier Anderson). Mr. Nobody changes his mind, determining the contract money for killing John to be insufficient, and helps him to escape. Caine allows a wounded Akira to flee after killing her father. John returns to New York and meets with a vengeful Winston at Charon's gravesite. Winston suggests John should do an old High Table tradition and challenge De Gramont to a duel. Winning would free John of all obligations to the High Table, but he can only request a duel on behalf of a crime family. He travels to the Berlin headquarters of the Ruska Roma crime syndicate, to request readmission after severing ties with them. John's adoptive sister Katia (Natalia Tena) agrees to his request in exchange for John killing High Table member Killa (Scott Adkins) who murdered her father. John is ambushed by many of Killa's men at his nightclub, but John manages to kill all of them; he manages to eliminate Killa and regain his status. Winston relays John's formal challenge to De Gramont. He requests that if John wins the challenge, the New York Continental be rebuilt, with him reinstated as manager. In Paris, John and De Gramont decide the parameters of their duel, in a meeting moderated by the Table's emissary, Harbinger (Clancy Brown). They decide on duelling pistols at sunrise at Sacr\u00e9-Coeur. De Gramont nominates a reluctant Caine to fight in his place. John and Winston will be executed if neither of them appears on time. The Bowery King arrives in Paris to give John a pistol and a new ballistic (bulletproof) suit. De Gramont intends to prevent John from arriving at the duel in time by placing a $26 million bounty on him, with a pirate radio station DJ (Marie Pierra Kakoma) reporting his movements to all assassins in the area. John fights off hordes of assassins a few miles from the Eiffel Tower on his way to Sacr\u00e9-Coeur. Mr. Nobody is there and negotiates the bounty be increased to $40 million. John continues to kill off more assassins inside a dilapidated building and runs into Mr. Nobody. During their confrontation, John prevents Chidi from killing Mr. Nobody's beloved dog. He is stunned and decides to abandon his pursuit of John and subsequently kills Chidi. John reaches a long staircase that leads to Sacr\u00e9-Coeur, where many killers try to stop him from reaching the top. After numerous kills, John does end up tumbling back down to the bottom, but Caine and Mr. Nobody assist him in traversing back up. They reach the summit just in time for the duel. Harbinger conducts the duel, John and Caine take their paces and inflict serious wounds on each other through two rounds of duelling. The third round comes to a halt when Caine mortally wounds John. Demanding the right to administer the coup de gr\u00e2ce (\"blow of mercy\"), De Gramont eagerly swaps places with Caine. However, as he approaches, John reveals he did not fire his third bullet, and shoots and kills an unsuspecting De Gramont. The Harbinger grants Caine and John their freedom from the High Table, and Winston is reinstated. John walks away and collapses on the staircase, reflecting upon his life and being married to his late wife Helen (Bridget Moynahan) before peacefully succumbing to his injuries. Sometime later, Winston and the Bowery King stand at John's gravesite where he is buried beside Helen. In a post-credits scene, Caine returns to Paris to reunite with his daughter but is approached by Akira, who pulls out a weapon, wanting vengeance for her father's death. Also starring Sven Marquardt as Klaus, and Andrej Kaminsky as Priest. Reeves remains cool and focused as the former assassin that will not be messed with, Skarsg\u00e5rd is sinister enough as the villain, Adkins in a fat suit is amusing as a supporting villain, and the support of Brown, McShane, Fishburne, and the late Reddick are welcome. The biggest problems I have with this fourth (and possibly final) outing in the series is that it is too long (3 hours 49 minutes), it is very repetitive (the amount of times John falls from a high height and is able to get up and run!!), and I don't know if there was a completely rounded revenge style story. However, I cannot deny that the fights are well choreographed, the body count and violence is high, and the birds eye view building gunfight sequence, the staircase climb, and the final showdown (all three irritatingly two hours later!) are highlights, it is a worthwhile action thriller.

The travel of John Wick going from point A to point B should always be an action packed unpredictable blood bath. All changed as this movie progressed. One can only assume ill-timed social distancing requirements and lazy production habits currently plaguing Hollywood started taking hold. Mr Wick, who typically has to fight through anonymous bounty hunters mixed in with crowds, no longer a problem. Plus Wick is showing up everywhere, Tokyo to NY to Berlin to Paris with zero explanation of how he got there. In prior installments arrangement to go to NY cost him a finger and he got branded just to secure passage to Casablanca. Fight scenes and gun battles, all loosing their timing and explosive choreography...halfway through replaced with tricky camera angles and flash lighting to hide the shoddiness. They establish a blind assassin using sensors to track enemy movement in close quarters (very cleaver), but all of a sudden he can bullseye gunshots at distance unassisted? The car chase scene through Paris, looked like it was shot on an original iPhone. Most obvious, running out of bullets stopped being a problem. Why? One of the cool things about John Wicks previous gun battles were the slick way he acquired ammo and reloaded. Eliminating that aspect was just plain lazy. All that aside I'm forced to agree with many, the gun battle with the exploding shotgun shells with a top down ceiling view, ingenious! Admittedly it was done so well it's how this movie got three stars instead of one.Still we have a contradictory plot enhanced by flip flopping character motivations. Comparing what came before, in every action sequence you always knew who was for or against Wick. His allies, enemies, old friends, fanatical fans, were unwavering no matter how how they felt personally. As this movie progressed you didn't know from one punch or gun shot to the next who was going to be on who's side.Note to the producers, if you're going to place Wick in the most crowded cities on earth you have to have swarms of people around, not just 2 or 3 like you're watching a staged play. You'll never see just two people on Tokyo subway train or walking through central park. It does nothing but take you right out of the movie.", "rating": 3, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 5, "votes": 10}, "heading": "It all goes to downhill...", "date": "2023-04-01T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8963986"}, {"content": "After witnessing the spectacle that is \"John Wick 4,\" I am convinced that it has the potential to be the greatest action movie of all time.

What is this even about? Who knows. People care for the action. But why do we then need to watch more than one hour of build-up for the action, you could watch the action without understanding what is going on, you don't need to know why these people fight, there is no conflict, and even if there is, it doesn't matter, because it has no consequences to the plot. The problem is that the plot is only sequenced trough talking, no visual language.That makes the movie feel like a video-game. The action-scenes are the one you interactively play, and the talking scenes are just long cut scenes. This Formula works for many games, but you can skip those cut-scenes. If it's a good game, the gameplay will make your blood rush and you will not care for that dialogue pause. Best example is Hitman, you don't care for the story, you just want to play.What is John Wicks Goal? I as a Viewer, gather nothing from the motivation of revenge, since the first movie the goal is the same, and it doesn't carry the weight of the first one. He does this all because of the last present his woman gave him, because of a dog. And while the film could dive into wicks character and analyze his psyche, and his former relationship to his woman, because she's the reason of this all happening, It rather focuses on an old friendship that now turned into an rivalry. I want to understand this man, and empathize with him, but the movie simply doesn't care about it's character work and the plot.Secondly the Pacing. It takes too long for the action to begin, and when it ends, it again takes take long until it begins again. A Simple process. And if the story is not compelling enough, it's hard to get trough.I feel like people are getting easier to please within every year and call everything a masterpiece. People seem to go crazy for mindless action without any substance. Without any conflict and emotion. It's nothing new. It's nothing we didn't had 20 years ago.Yes, the Action is good filmed. The lighting is great, but what does it really matter? Is an good action flick really what we need more of nowadays. The genre is oversaturated. It has no weight anymore for me. Filmmakers need to try and do something fresh. I do not want to turn of my brain during a movie.After one and an half hour during the movie passed, I asked myself an Important Question during the movie.What was the intention of John Wick 4? It was not a Vision the director wanted to show us, because there is no vision. Most importantly, there are no emotions. Nothing to move the audience with. There is no art behind this. Even if it's well made, this whole movie feel feels like an ad.So now, I know exactly what the intention of John Wick 4 was.

And then when we finally reach the climatic duel, two professional killers can't manage a head shot from a distance of 40 paces? I know...maybe they weren't trying to kill each other. But each one knew that the duel had to result in a death. That's the stinkin' High Table rules! A bigger problem, though, is the almost three-hour running time. It may allow time to introduce more characters, but we don't get to know most of them. Wick's friend Shimazu is introduced and killed off. John's adoptive sister Katia is a promising character, but only has two quick scenes. Charon, one of the best characters in the series, is executed in the first half-hour.

The story and dialogue is workmanlike and efficient.The action peaks in an epic sequence that is part Taxi Driver's overhead shot after the massacre, part hi-res FPS video game 3rd person replay, and it touches on genius.Each of these movies has expanded the \"Wick world\" so to speak, and in doing so Wick hasn't had an opportunity to reflect. It's been run and gun since day one, son.Should there be another chapter, and I suspect there will be, here's hoping they slowly strip back the layers of decadence and allow us a moment of peace and happiness.But let us earn that tranquility with one final run.

I'll even concede that no one should want to stick around given the shooting, but it would be swarmed with police rather quicker than 20 minutes.Not specific to this film, but it is overtly noticeable because it is such an action heavy movie, any time there is more than 1 or 2 guys attacking John, there's ALWAYS people noticeably just \"waiting their turn to die\" as per the script.In JW3 it was the Asian guys that gave him a chance to stand up and fight fairly, the second guy was always just sort of waiting or rolling around needlessly. Same thing in this movie.Also, if no one is scared of the cops showing up, you can't tell me that a dozen or more guys haven't been honing their rifle skills to shoot their targets at a distance of more than hugging.Despite the complaints above, it was still a good movie, definitely did not feel like 3 hours, and I'll gladly add it to the movie collection.", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 4}, "heading": "Wasn't nearly as perfect as everyone is claiming", "date": "2023-03-31T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8961559"}, {"content": "And so the story of Wick continues.

Videogame-like pedestrians, partygoers and car drivers that just keep ignoring the carnage taking place all around them, driving past or running over dozens of bad guys with guns and assault rifles.... As if nothing was happening at all around them.Where are all the police officers in this world?? Not a single police car showing up at any location at all. Ludicrous.The guys that made this movie are just videogame junkies.

I don't know, the John Wick's health and energy bars keep replenishing themselves as the time goes by.Somebody at the helm should have watched movies like John Frankenheimer's Ronin for a little bit of inspiration.Jon Wick 3 Parabellum was lots of fun and felt like a great cinematic experience because aside endless and exhausting fighting scenes it continued and followed a story woven through 2 previous movies. Because the storyline didn't feel contrived and really felt like a conclusion, because it made sense and because John had a clear, defined and achievable purpose. And also because the world and characters of this Universe were opened up, expanded and we got to see new interesting characters and locations.But part 4 just recycles some things from part 3 and try to stretch the bubble gum just a bit too much. I thought Lawerence Fishburne was to play a greater role but he is there just for fan service. It almost seemed like John was out there killing for the sake of killing for 3 straight hours. Period.And I cannot fully convey my astonishment at this world of Parisien NPCs that cannot be bothered by the thunderous sound of blazing bullets and the corpses piling up on the roads in the early hours of the morning nearby one of the main touristic attractions of Paris.

I mean we're talking birds in flight violence, bone-crunching poetry, and nunchucks (\"don't forget the nunchucks\"). Like cinematic, habanero hot sauce, it just hurts so good.John Wick: Chapter 4's director is Chad Stahelski (duh). He has only done four pics and they're all Wicks. Besides introducing a few new characters (two of which being a sightless assassin and a bloodthirsty canine), Stahelski fashions John Wick as a guy who has to fight because there's nothing else he knows how to do. It's almost fascinating and goofy at the same time. I mean does Wick eat? Doesn't seem like it. Does Wick sleep? Probably not. Does Wick use the bathroom? They might attack him while he's in there. Finally, does Wick take time to read a book or sip hot cocoa at Starbucks? Get real people. \"Chapter 4\" is all about Reeves kicking butt and it has just enough action takes for the fly-by, 169-minute running time. I'll pay $10.50 for that noise.", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "VIEWS ON FILM review of John Wick: Chapter 4", "date": "2023-03-30T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8960953"}, {"content": "\"You come here thinking there is a way out of this world for you, Mr. Wick.

This is what John Wick as a brand has achieved over the years and Chapter 4 is by far its best gift.It is a love letter to cinema and filmmaking at large where action, no longer used as a prop, takes centerstage and is celebrated by ballerinas like Keanu Reeves, and Donnie Yen who dignify the space with their own charm and metallic personality. Stunning to say the least. Well choreographed endless string of eye-popping action sequences - 14 in the finale act are a match made in heaven like ebbs visible only for a moment. The high table just shatters with those bombs one after the other anhilating the screen to smithereens.Overall, John Wick along with the awe inspiring tonality brushed with magnificent camera work and excruciatingly long set pieces tricks you into a dreamy state of ecstasy and establishes a benchmark that will go down in history as a thesis on how to make memorable action films. After all who would have imagined that a party scene would show people with authority fighting their own hideous battles in the background unwithered by the careless mob taking care of business by recklessly dancing to the beats without substance.

The story is somewhat secondary to the action which is absolutely fine. The cinematography is very clean, the characters are interesting and the locations look great.My main hang-up with the John Wick movies and more modern action is ironically the fight scenes. Since there are so many, it all ends up following the same patterns. 50 guys will show up, he'll shoot two or three at a time, there will randomly be a big gap when he can run out of ammo or drop his weapon to do a mini fight and MMA takedown pick up another conveniently placed gun and headshot them. Then instantly some more guys turn up only when he's ready but he'll also miss the miniboss henchmen despite hitting everything else with headshots, rinse and repeat. It is too choreographed, even when they try to make it look like he could possibly lose.I'm fine with suspending some disbelief when it comes to these things because it is fantastical, but the issue is that it's a little repepetive and there are next to no stakes the more it happens especially since he wears literal plot armour. Plus if you look at any background henchman during these things there are weird time fills. There's literally a part in this when he's fighting one guy and someone in the background stands up and hugs a drum and falls back down because they're clearly having to wait and it's just out of place. Especially when you have Donnie Yen in your movie who famously does fight scenes with multiple people all at once.I do like that they change it up a bit with the car scene and the gunfight shot from overhead, the real shining moments of this movie are they go through with everyone essentially \"winning\" but still had the courage to end the movie the way they did because they could easily have chickened out.

Then there's the ambiguous presence of fellow assassins Caine (Yen, great as always) and Nobody (Anderson, good newcomer) who have solid arcs.It's pretty impressive they've made four of these films in 10 years, when you take covid into account. The film sets the scene a little, then gets right down to business - Wick & his bulletproof suit killing plenty of \"bad guys\". I lost count, but would guess it's over 250 in the entire film, with over 100 to Wick! You pay to see action, and this film certainly delivers. The series now seems to be in a comfortable place with reality suspended - especially the Arc de Triomphe scene. There's a lack of police, the \"magic\" suits, no one shooting Wick in the head for some reason - where he's become a mix of The Punisher (shoots lots & lots of people, revenge in key driver), Wolverine (doesn't seem to ever die, can use a sword) & James Bond (the suit, good at all forms of combat).While long, the pacing is good, with enough breathers to keep it interesting.

However, that's not to say that this movie comes without its flaws. Because even with its overlong runtime weakening the actual product, there's still some other issues that block it from ranking higher than the first film.But if you've paid the entry fee with a craving mainly for kick-ass action with Keanu Reeves at the centre, visually striking direction and with a lack of care for sensical plot, you're in luck. Although each are usually several minutes too long, this film is loaded with the most distinctive and hooking combat fight scenes located throughout the entire franchise. For many, watching John Wick brutally shoot up a bunch of bad guys in a very stylistic fashion is entertaining, but the amount of damage taken by the characters is also where one of the film's most distracting plot holes roots between.The reason a lot of the action scenes are all-fun-with-no-suspense-or-excitement is because it seems that damage and brutality doesn't really apply to John Wick, where everyone else he fights typically dies at the instant. He can go tumbling down a humorously long staircase and get shot or stabbed, but he can always get back up with seemingly no impact from the injuries. The motives presented by the characters is also a sizeable issue, giving the movie what feels like so many convoluted purposes to the point where the whole project could've just been thrown away and forgotten.Some will agree that within the context of a film review, the critic needs to get the positives in first and finish with the flaws. This review doesn't follow that order because John Wick: Chapter 4 is still a decent action-thriller you'd want to leave off on a good note from. Anyway, this film is definitely the best of the sequels due to the fact that's it's entertaining, more distinctive, the writing is much better and there's surprises along the way to await for. It may have a runtime of nearly 3 hours, but it always feels like the plot is always moving forward, even if it gets a bit ridiculous at times. Performances by Keanu Reeves, Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, Scott Adkins and Donnie Yen also deliver some of the effect.

I'll start by saying the action sequences (all 9,000 of them) are breathtakingly choreographed. John Wick's trademarked 'GunFu' is on full display in Chapter 4 (for better or worse). This chapter easily has the highest body count out of the series, but you can't rely on bodies and bullets as your main focal point, especially if it's supposedly the last chapter (I highly doubt it is). Wick is weighed down by plot armor so thick it deflects literally everything, including the viewer's belief that Mr. Wick will ever be in any danger. Hit by 10 cars? Tis but a scratch!My main issue with Chapter 4 is that the plot is very thin and it's stretched out over 3 hours. This chapter is very 'Beginning. Middle. End'. The beginning and end are 5 minutes a piece, while the middle is two and a half hours of John effortlessly walking through goons (which is great, until it's not). I love me some Wick slaughtering goons, but when 95% of the movie is gun fire, you begin to forget what the plot even is, what the movie's even about, which is not good. This movie could've easily been cut down to 2 hours if they edited the fight scenes to a reasonable time, so I hope you don't like plot with your action.Another gripe I had is the fact that John Wick had like maybe 10 lines of dialogue? The guy barely spoke a word throughout the entirety of the movie, and when he did speak, 99% of the time it was him going \"Yeah...\" (which is great, until it's not). Maybe use Keanu/Wick as a vehicle for the plot instead of having him be a mute protagonist of an FPS video game? He's the title character for God sake! In Chapters 1 and 2, Wick showed a lot of emotion and vulnerability through dialogue and acting (at least more than this chapter) to express himself, but in this he is pretty much the Doomslayer. Also, is it just me or was Keanu's acting extra bad in this one? The line delivery sometimes was just... oof, even for Keanu standards.My favorite part of the movie is a top-down one-take scene near the end where Wick is blasting through goons with incendiary ammo.Overall, the movie is a good time and if you're a Wick fan, then you won't be disappointed.

Still, I'm quite surprise with the turn-up.This is an Action movie foremost, with great lighting, great locations and excellent camera work. And more importantly, a real desire to entertain and indulge anyone interested in the genre. The choreography and planning must have been an undertaking, and is great for the most part.. as I feel suffers a bit when Keanu is on screen and as a whole! Specially as it gets a bit repetitive and exhausting with it's length, as well as when you start noticing Keanue's age as he deals with waves of 2 stunt-men at a time rather.. clumsily. It simply looks bad when 2 suits come in, and then 2 armored soldiers, and then 2 suits again and again.The movie seems to be tailored for other characters on it's way out, instead. Mr. Nobody has his well deserved moments, Donnie is easily the best actor on screen (with the best action and his ever charming presence).. but who is closely followed by another great Skarsg\u00e5rd performance! With a great villain most recent movies would kill for. And I'm a fan of Sanada-san.Keanue's stunts aside, his dialogue repertoire is also laughable at best. And not just the lines, but his delivery..\nAll together, makes it hard to invest in a 4th installment (with the previous ones going in circles and ending where they started) that feels tired and offers little I hadn't seen before (over-view camera aside). Personally, I thought it wouldn't hurt to spend SOME time setting-up the impossibility of \"getting out\", and for Wick's character to become a beacon of hope for those that felt trapped in the system they are in.. giving his arc some needed gravitas, weight and meaning behind these actions.

So let's start. The plot is super simple but really? It's not much. Once again we just have John Wick killing literally armies of people in all kinds of ways. I have no idea how many people he killed, I will probably check a YouTube video, I'm sure someone will make a kill count type video. I have to admit that some kills were very creative, even artistic you could say. I watch the John Wick movies more like a meme than an actual movie. Maybe you wonder why? Well let's face it, the main concept is absolutely ridiculous and doesn't make any sense. You have an old man who is able to fight non stop for hours entire armies and he never dies. When the movie started we had some really cool and creative fight scenes and I got very hyped but you get more and more and more and more fight scenes and the whole thing gets extremely repetitive fast and eventually extremely boring, i wanted to leave the theater at some point.Most scenes are impressive and it's obvious that people worked really hard on them to make every scene and every kill feel intense and unique. I wish they took the time to have a little bit more plot / dialogue and less fights. But also many people love the John Wick movies for being exactly that, plotless and full of action, like super full. I still like the whole system of rules these people / criminals have and have to follow, like the ending with the whole cowboy-like scene was really cool, felt unique instead of having some really fast paced action scenes. I have to say that the acting wasn't really impressive. John Wick is an emotionless, almost robotic dude that shows no emotion and answers questions with 1 or 2 words. Also the main villain played by Bill Skarsgard, let's say it wasn't much. He didn't realy feel like a threat or a psychopath or anything. His scenes made me feel nothing or cringe. I don't know what went wrong, maybe wrong casting? This villain was ridiculous, an absolute fail. Hiroyuki Sanada was awesome though, I wish he had more screen time.Something I really liked was the music choices with some really cool dark electro and ebm tracks playing. In my opinion if the movie had a little bit more story, more plot, more mystery even, this could have been a masterpiece. It's such a shame because with such good cast you could do great things. But right now to me it is just an ok movie which I don't think I will rewatch ever again. The end will have you believing that John is dead but im sure that if they want to bring him back, they can find many ways to do it. Conclusion: Impressive fight scenes, effects, music, editing, cinematography. Mediocre acting, non existent plot, needs more dialogue, extremely repetitive, boring at times. The John Wick movies don't deserve the hype they get for sure. Just plotless movies for people who want to watch a movie that looks exactly like a YouTuber's gameplay for a fighting / shooting game.My rating for Chapter 3 was 5/10 but I believe that Chapter 4 is a bit better.

From start to finish 80-95% of the movie is straight up action with the rest being scenes with dialogue. This movie delivers what you expect from a john wick film - which is the action packed assassin doing what he does best relentlessly. As a fan to the movies I left the theatres satisfied with my experience knowing that this would be a great ending to the journey (if it really is the last wick movie or not) and that it was worth every penny to see.Pros:\nIt john wick. Pure action with amazing choreography as he fights through the underground world of the high table.All supporting actors brought dynamics to the story & the action that went well with the franchise.You get to see different parts of the world & respectively how they operated in this underground empire.There is some of the full circle style storytellingFelt like a good ending (if it truly is one)Cons:\nBeginning kind of jumps around trying to wrap up the left overs from the past movie (I'd recommend watching #3 before this one because I didn't and didn't refresh on it so maybe if I had it would have made a bit more sense)Movie was kind of long and I feel like there was a couple scenes or fights that could've been cut out (staircase scenes began to become a bit redundant or the german nightclub)Caine. I know a lot of people loved him, but for me the whole being blind but shooting people with pinpoint accuracy despite have to use doorbells in earlier scenes to know where people were was a bit inconsistent. For example, he needs doorbell alarms for people relatively near to him but then doesn't need anything to shoot people at a bigger distance during the staircase scenes. I just feel like if he was partially blind or like had one eye it would have been better. However, he did kick some a.. which was fun to watch & besides the nit picking was a nice addition.Mr. Nobody as a tracker made sense and at the end I get why he does what he does but at the end what was the point to dedicating so much time to him? He felt like his place in this movie was intentionally made for a potential spin-off as did with Caine & the daughter of the japan hotel.Overall:\nJohn wick 4 was a great addition to the franchise and stay trued to the cinematography, feel, identity, and expectations anyone would have.

While I still see Keanu from the Bill and Ted franchise .. the way he talks and how he \"acts\" ... well if you've seen it once, you can't unsee it. That said, it does not take away anything from the action extravaganza that is going on in this. Actually that makes me want to revisit the other Wick movies and maybe re-rate them. Giving them a higher score.Also I have to admit, that even though Denzel is the better actor (no secret here), franchise wise Wick has totally obliterated the Equalizer franchise ... kind of like he obliterates his enemies as Wick. You may wonder why they even try .. I guess for our amusement. For those who are able to stomache all the violence that is of course.I did watch this on an Imax screen and let me tell you: violence never looked better. But also everything else. Be it dawn, sunrise and everything in between. There are many scenes and there are some quotes that should be inspirational too. Friendship means little when it's convenient ... that is some deep ... stuff right there.I don't think that the movie gives the viewer too many riddles when it comes to guessing where it all leads to. You also should not mind the fact that Keanu or rather Wick must have a bionic body ... or his suit actually is made of a material that shields his body ... well one or the other ... or you just suspend your disbelief and go with the flow. It makes as much sense as driving cars into space (yes looking at you Fast and Furious franchise) ... but we do not watch these movies for logic and rhyme and reason. I'd hope the same applies to you.There are some really great visual stunts in Paris - and it looks like they shot them there. But CGI is so far ahead ... who really knows? It does look awesome though. And towards the end ... the action inside a house and the way it is shot ... the director is coming up with new stuff all the time.And for the first time ever (in a John Wick movie), there is an after credit scene ... so sit down and wait for it - even if it may not be entirely satisfactory ... then again, until the next one comes out (it surely must be announced soon, no matter how this ended), the ending here is also ... well you may not be entirely happy with it ... but happy is a word that is missing in Wicks dictionary anyway ... so there we go.Edit: I don't do pointers when I write reviews which leads to me forgetting stuff. Lance Reddick who recently passed away and will be missed, was obviously an integral part of the franchise. Many may know him from TV shows, such as Fringe, The Wire and many more. But apart from him and many recurring characters (those who survive that is), we get many Newcomers. Bill Skarsgard being the top villain - and he does a great accent! As does Scott Adkins - ja!

He felt out of place in this film.Then there is the black guy who is a military cowboy...? I mean OK I guess but he added nothing to this film.Now we get to the action scenes which in my opinion is the movies biggest flaw.There was a flow to the action scenes in the previous 3 films but not here. In this movie the gunplay feels wasted because every character is wearing armor or some bulletproof suit, which means that everybody using a gun has to use it the exact same way...all head shots with no variation.Ok but guys can still fight right?No...not really most of the hand to hand combat is broken up by you guessed it more gunplay.There is a part early on in the film where John is fighting with nunchaku and my man clearly don't know how to use them.

All the fighting sequences just like Shaw Brothers' 1970s poor and laughable Hong Kong martial art movies, heavily choreographically staged, looked so forced and fake.

Ironically, this lacks any - so the result feels a tad hollow / insincere.Using the action as an example; since Chad Stahelski never analyses the impact this gratuitous violence has on innocent bystanders caught up in the crossfire (though conflict's regularly involving or taking place amongst civilians), despite the grandiosity of what we're witnessing, there are very little stakes for us to emotionally invest ourselves in - due to the fact that there seems to be hardly any impact to anything unfolding.As comparisons, \"007\" or \"Mission Impossible\" (similar franchises which essentially succeed in emulating the same formula - to greater effect; revered assassin / spy jets around the globe to bring down a nefarious organisation) at least have the courtesy to explore the accidental ramifications of their protagonist's behaviours (helping to ground the story in something authentic & real whilst simultaneously challenging the flawed identities of the iconic lead by questioning the moral ambiguity of each individual, seeing how they respond to collateral, demonstrating why the perspective whose eyes we follow things through are ones we should care about etc.), yet this doesn't; John apparently exists in a hermetically sealed bubble, devoid of exterior interaction - where damage is contained solely within the confines of the elusive \"Table\", rendering events as superficial & trivial - when the destructiveness of consecutive clashes serves no discernible purpose - other than for the sake of it.The literal opposite (& a blatant contradiction) of supposed \"consequences\".Then there's a secondary reason to disengage; the lack of clear intent driving \"Mr Wick\" forward. Any writer knows that although a fictional creation may not have to be very likeable, they must be relatable or sympathetic in some way, shape or form - to ensure we're somewhat / partially invested in their emotional journey; the method in which a character chooses to react might be perhaps disproportionate (after all, art's entire point is to spark debate from subjectivity & we learn empathy through comprehending choices which don't align with our own) so (to quote \"Dr Manhattan\" in Zack Snyder's \"Watchmen\": \"without condoning, or condemning\") I understand... But again, here, there's nothing.In the first (co-directed by David Leitch), we were presented with a standard (serviceable) revenge flick rationale; his puppy's murdered & considering the sentimental value assigned to the dog, his quest for retribution led to swift & brutal vengeance - whereas here? Comically, the screenplay seems nonethewiser; continually, Keanu Reeves' title role's associates often ask \"to what end?\" & the answer is never actually provided.Heck, even during one verbal exchange of dialogue, the antagonist subtly states men can be separated in to 3 categories: \"those who have something to live for, those who have something to die for & those who have something to kill for\" before announcing his nemesis (our main guy & the reason for him being an enigma) has \"none of those things\"... So being devoid of sufficient motivation to plausibly explain any further development (or any visible carnage), his characterisation feels stilted & one-note, dragged out for the remainder of the run-time, offering no satisfying arc... Simply churning out more of the same, on a larger scale & with less heft, conveying a lot whilst also failing to merely articulate slightly a little.There's an abundance of glossy style (to compensate) & the ridiculously high quality of it's indisputable...

It was worth the wait, combining the mythology-heavy approach of the last couple chapters with the streamlined action of the first film, resulting in a final hour that is among the best of the genre. John Wick: Chapter 4 opens with Wick (Reeves) on the run from the villainous Powers That Be known as the High Table. The main villain of the series is the Marquis de Gramont (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd), a leader of the High Table who keeps raising the bounty on Wick's head while he also cleans up the messes left behind. The opening scenes take Wick to Japan, where he seeks help from the head of the Osaka Continental, Shimazu (Hiroyuki Sanada), and runs afoul of a blind High Table assassin named Caine (Donnie Yen). Laurence Fishburne pops up as Wick's Q when the killer needs a new bulletproof suit, and Shamier Anderson plays an assassin waiting for the price to hit the right level for him to get his payday. Despite the movie's epic runtime (169 minutes), the plot feels refreshingly focused again. The only minor flaw in Wick's armor is a bit of narrative self-indulgence, but fans won't care. This is a movie that should be seen with a cheering, excited crowd, as it has that contagious energy and is meant to be watched loud and big. John Wick has fought hard for it. The stunts and fight choreography of John Wick are top tier, and the director, Chad Stahelski, got his start in the movie industry as a stuntman.\"John Wick: Chapter 4\" is by far the best of the four films starring Keanu Reeves as the eponymous hit man. It has many of the same problems as its predecessors, but something happens late in the game that converts the film's merely technical displays of bloody murder into something suspenseful and romantic. Director Chad Stahelski reteams with key crew, including production designer Kevin Kavanaugh, and there's fresh blood in the cast, most notably Donnie Yen as blind assassin Caine and Scott Adkins as Killa, a murderous plus-sized German equipped with metal teeth. The details are too good to give away, but there's no harm and much pleasure in considering how the movie climbs to that light-headed summit. The movie reprises the basic structure of past films, with Wick (Keanu Reeves) slicing his way through the henchmen of his former employers, the High Table. The stunt work is spectacular, with human bodies being hurled into moving vehicles and Reeves's double tumbling down the Sacr\u00e9-Coeur stairs. Stahelski also delivers one extended, mind-bogglingly complicated fight sequence in a single shot, the camera floating overhead.

Not only is this one of the best looking action films I've ever seen, it also, for the most part, contains the best action setpieces. Watching this film reminded me most of playing a video game. I'm currently playing the Resident Evil 4 remake, and even though John Wick isn't a horror movie, the action was most reminiscient of a survival horror experience, with Wick constantly scavenging weapons and ammo from fallen enemies. There's no infinite ammo hacks in the Wick series, and that continues.The bigger issue is plot armour, which Wick has in droves. His suit is explained to be made of Kevlar, but no amount of Kevlar justifies the amount of punishment he survives. Also the choreography of one of the minor characters, named Akira, was slightly lacking. She used a bow and arrow and Judo throws, but the enemies she fought were on easy mode compared to Wick's. Don't blame the actress necessarily, she probably just needed a little more practice. Fortunately she was only in one fight scene, and the rest of the action was very fun to watch.My other gripe is the story. Every subsequent Wick film escalates both the action, and the plot contrivances to justify the action. The world of John Wick is one where half the population are assassins, and there are no cops. Seriously, the climax of the film is set in Paris, and there are NO COPS ANYWHERE, while Wick is killing droves of people across four different popular landmarks in peak traffic conditions. There's also an office for the Table (or whatever the assassin org is called) in the Eiffel Tower, where a DJ uses barely coded language to tell all the assassins where Wick is going. It's peak silliness.I'm not gonna dock too many points for this, but I think it is possible to make a movie that has both top tier action and a comprehensible plot with good worldbuilding. Wick has the former and not the latter. We know that there are good action movies with great resonant plots out there. Stuff like Everything Everywhere shows that it is possible. The Matrix still holds up in this regard too (though the action has aged a little) and maybe the future of this franchise will offer better stories as well.In any case, if you want 2 1/2 hours of fantastic action, John Wick 4 continues to deliver.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 4}, "heading": "The best fight scenes I have ever seen", "date": "2023-03-28T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8955270"}, {"content": "We get much of the same intense action in this installment of the John Wick franchise as we did from the first 3 movies.

Barebow, katana, cane-sword, nunchaku, sniper rifle, metallic poker, blaster, dueling pistol, all manipulated in the most enthralling and incredible way, not as disposable tools, but as dopamine-full syringes that inject thrilling signals right down the thalamus. In particular, two combat scenes electrified me (no spoilers don't worry), the first being Caine's \"warmup\": his leisurely demeanor, ingenious gadgets, and breakneck motion swiftly establish a dangerous figure that actually might neutralize John Wick in his own movie. Bringing back memory of the blind monk from Rogue One, Donnie Yen's performance of Caine is exquisite, whether his gait, head movement, or battle style. The second scene that blew me away was John's slaughter in the suite, where a long shot follows the killing machine from above the ceiling through multiple rooms as he effortlessly obliterates his enemies with a freaking dragon's breath shotgun. Despite the ubiquitous usage of long takes to display flawless action designs, this scene tops it all off with inventive cinematography, and I love every bit of the RPG vibe it gives.However, like Black Adam, constant fighting comes at a price, which in this case is shown through the characters, the story, and the plot progression. Mr. Nobody is a slightly redundant character, especially when compared to Caine, with an inconsistent motive and a forgettable presence. In my opinion, the part of this character could be entirely deleted to enrich Caine's connection with his daughter and with John, which would result in a more engaging final showdown - but, having Donnie Yen in this film is a blessing, so not a big complaint. However, the abundance of action sequences does perceptively make the plot simpler, as many of the events are deliberately arranged just to transition into another brawl. In the end, there is a point where the fighting fatigues, and I'm referring to the staircase scene: seeing John neymar his way down those steps he took such a long time to climb disrupts the momentum completely. Lastly, perhaps Keanu is a revered celebrity, but he is probably the worst actor in this movie: robotic line delivery, immutable facial expression, and the hairstyle that confuses John Wick with Neo from Matrix Resurrection.Overall, one of the best action films of the decade, but an average movie in all other aspects.", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 5}, "heading": "Yeeeah, I Know Gun-Fu", "date": "2023-03-27T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8955166"}, {"content": "I saw \"John Wick 4\" yesterday.

Then came number three which I was really quite disappointed with.

This time our wandering warrior (Keanu Reeves) is out for revenge, but not before the all-powerful \"Marquis\" (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd), who has managed to get those at the \"High Table\" to give him complete control of their global operations, decides to seek some of his own - and that includes trashing the New York hotel and putting \"Winston\" (Ian McShane) out of an home and a job. A rather unnecessary, and fatal, side effect of that activity put's his nose out of joint too; and when the \"Marquis\" turns his attention on Osaka - possibly the last bastion of support for \"Wick\", we just know that we are in for a series of never-ending hand-to-hand fisticuffs that are straight out of a video game.

But the ride was so bombastic, dark and mumbly that at a certain point it was like being stuck on a roller coaster ride that I've gone through 10 times and gradually sunk deeper and deeper into my chair.What is this movie about? Long were the days of the original John Wick, where it felt nicely paced. A short film extended into a feature but still retained an independent film vibe. Those days are gone. When the original Wick came out, they kept it simple...man seeks revenge on some punks who killed his dog given to him from dead wife. That plot alone is laughably simple. Yet it worked. Perhaps it was the zeitgeist at the time. But this series falls into the VERY same trap they all do. Bigger everything. And that wasn't the case. The Table is a mysterious group that had slick lingo with caricatures of other movies that made you feel something familiar. The call center with its tattoo'd Betties seemed so out of a Jean Pierre Jeunet film like \"City Of Lost Children\" It was unique in the sense that it embraced its steam punk comic book feel. Then it imploded into ridiculous feats of inhuman strength. And a total lack of logic. Police apparently don't exist in John Wick Paris. Ugh.Also, the stunts are great but after (I would calculate) an hour of the same aerobatics, leg locks, tosses and gun shot to head, I grew tired. Made me want to scream to move on. Yes, it has a visceral release to a general audience (I heard a few in my theater clap with approval. But also consider there was one mentally challenged one in a wheel-chair, the other was an elderly lady who was talking through the movie). The original Wick made you really feel the pain of its villains. And made it satisfying. Here, when he goes room to room sweeping with a fire launching shotgun, I wanted to REALLY cheer. It felt flat. Well done, but something was missing. That's what this entire movie felt like. Something missing. Keanu is obviously an expert gun handler now and does hand to hand combat well, but man was it getting old fast.Bill Skarsgard, as the villain, seems to be tapping into Rami Malek from \"No Time To Die\" He's a meglamaniac whose ties to this under ground assassin league is anchored to funding it. Did they ever explain why this society even exists? Probably not. I was bored. Also, Ian MacShane's Manager role is exhaustively pedestrian.. I mean, tiresome tropes come out of his mouth as if it were the first time hearing it.Everyone is desperate to be cool in this flick. Finally, the Donnie Yen character. Okay, a LOT cannot be forgiven. He is dragged into wanting to kill Wick because of threats to his family. Yet, he kills everyone BUT Wick and yet gets to survive. Here's the problem. It telegraphed it when he would incapacitate the guys in the kitchen of the Osaka branch. Instead of violently kill them. That's how you can tell he wasn't going to be a bad dude.Oof. They add an extra assassin who totes along a dog. That dog was getting on my nerves. And I love dogs. This dog seemed to be trained to sick men's privates. For some reason. After the 5th go at this gag, it was dead in the water.This is a subpar entry into the series. Though they kill off Wick in this flick (yeah right) he see some future installment with say...the daughter of the Osaka branch who seemed to have projected a future conflict with Wick in the future.This series will never end as long as simple minded audiences exists.

The Japan, warehouse fight, and the dual sequences were shot with so much depth and precision. The camera did some of the most impressive things I've seen on film. The stunts were brutal and downright impressive at times. Noteable stunts like the Japanese continental fight, the warehouse, and the steps to the church, and many more were, at their core a tribute to the stunt people. The action was immensely great and the writing was on point. The two hour and fifty minute runtime flew by. I'm the end, John Wick: Chapter 4 is the perfect end for the franchise. Wicks story only had one ending as foreshadow and told to us in the past three films. His story comes full circle in this entire and what a gut punch of a circle it is.

My apologies if my slightly low rating offends some people. I'll keep spoilers to a minimum.The movie starts and picks up immediately from where it left off from the previous movie wasting zero time. Fast paced action like the previous installments. The visuals are good with a lot of scenes being very colorful despite most of the fight scenes takes place at night. Fight arenas where huge fights break out are visually stunning just like the previous installment.Sound composer is superb with subtle heart rhythm in certain scenes, although not Christopher Nolan level but certainly very interesting use of sound effects.Vast array of weapons used and some interactions conducted in the local language which is what the real world is like. You don't go to some foreign country expecting their people especially big time crime lords to speak English all the time. I also see someone took inspiration from Jackie Chan stunt technique to make some fight scene looks serious and comical at the same time.At the end of the movie, it's a huge relief seeing the burden being lifted of John Wicks, the man himself Keanu Reeves and the moviegoers whom have been diligently following through a 4 movies.The cons and spoilers\nCharacter development seems to have taken back seat compared to previous movies. The movie also looks rushed as some sharp eye audiences will notice.The plot might be linear and fast paced just like the Fast Furious series but the main difference being, if someone is watching JW4 for the first time with no background knowledge is going to be left with a lot of questions.Wouldn't it be much more engaging if Winston was killed instead of his concierge? Then his concierge being the loyal servant works with other concierge members around the world to help JW avenge Winston's killer. First time watchers would be pleased too.And JW this time seems to have his entire magical 3 piece suit made out of vibranium. Sustaining little injuries despite having platoons of men and women unloading obscene amounts of rounds at one man. Perhaps they all graduated from stormtrooper school.The previous movies sees JW taking hits, seeking medical care and more character development where the audience feels more for him. David vs Goliath moment. His death scene almost looks too good, did they hire a coroner for his make up? The blood patches look too dry like its painted on. Ironman's death looks spot on as completely devastated shock, awe and peace at the same time.Action scene in Japan seems to have the stuntman ninjas frozen in literal fear for his life. They just stood there shaking in fear waiting for JW to mercifully dispatch them. Then seem all fine and dandy taking shots from a machine gun but one throw from JW against the wall, they stand shaking in fear.Waterfall that works in mysterious ways, haven't figured out how the waterfall club works as he fight completely drenched but walks down the stairs little water dripping off him.It's a relief to see the man and the legend can finally closed off the original franchise for good.", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Pros: nice visuals and face paced actions Cons: plot too predictable and action scenes can look fake", "date": "2023-03-27T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8954558"}, {"content": "This movie is just too good.

The film is again directed by Chad Stahelski, who also directed the three previous films.The price on John Wick (Keanu Reeves) continues to rise, prompting more and more deadly opponents to take on him. As John faces off against these new enemies, he also tries to regain his freedom at The High Table, but this demands a lot from him and he can trust fewer and fewer people.With this fourth John Wick film, they are going bigger again with more different types of action. For example, this film contains good and different types of action scenes in succession, which they have put together in creative ways. The film can be reminiscent of The Raid action films where you get to see more action than a real story emerges in the film. This is such a fun and entertaining movie for fans of brutal and entertaining action movies. The movie is also set in different places around the world. This way you get to see a beautiful and creative background where the characters compete against each other. Fights take place in an Asian museum, in a dance club and around the Arc de Triomphe.Due to the long running time and the further lack of a real story, this film sometimes comes across as empty in addition to its action scenes. You learn a little more about the fictional world in which the John Wick films take place, but most of the lines in the films are not always easy to understand. In some scenes where two enemies are together, you don't always understand why they don't kill each other immediately, but take on other opponents first.At the age of 58, Keanu Reeves still manages to deliver entertaining and believable action sequences. Even when he takes blows, he often still manages to defeat his enemies. He has also done most of his stunts himself and only uses a stuntman when John Wick is hit by an enemy car, for example.It is also nice to see Laurence Fishburne, Ian McShane and Lance Reddick back in their well-known roles from the series. They know how to portray their well-known roles in good and recognizable ways. It's just a pity that Lance Reddick passed away suddenly earlier this month.Of the many newcomers to the John Wick world, enough know how to steal the film in their moments. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd plays more of a somewhat corrupt businessman who tries to arrange everything from behind the scenes to deal with John Wick. Shamier Anderson plays more of a mysterious hunter, who neither John Wick nor you as a viewer are ever sure if he can really be trusted.Hiroyuki Sanada and Donnie Yen bring a more Asian fighting culture to the John Wick world. Both portray different Asian fighting styles and cultures in the film. For example, Hiroyuki Sanada plays a more wise, honorable warrior, who knows how to take out his enemies in clever ways. Donnie Yen plays a blind character again, just like he did in the Star Wars Spin-off film Rogue One. Despite this handicap, he again portrays his character in a believable and dangerous way.", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 2}, "heading": "The fourth John Wick film contains almost three hours of entertaining action, but has little story.", "date": "2023-03-27T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8953707"}, {"content": "Baba Yaga is back and is so ruthless that you won't be able to get your eyes of him.This movie raised the bar for action movies to a whole new level.The movie delivers exactly what the fans want, i.e., insane action.John wick with guns.

He lifts the scorpion out of the water, but the scorpion stings him and he drops it back. The sage tries again, but the scorpion stings him once more. The sage does not give up and attempts to save the scorpion for the third time, but he gets stung again. He asks the scorpion why it keeps hurting him when he is trying to help. The scorpion replied, \"I cannot help it. It is my nature to sting.\"The moral of the story is that some creatures cannot change their nature and it is important to accept this fact and act accordingly.This story applies to John Wick, a hitman who cannot escape his identity as an assassin. One character from the movie tells John that he is an assassin, and despite his efforts to get out of the business, he can't deny who he is. Even though John tries to avoid violence, he keeps getting pulled into it, and it's inevitable that he will continue to be a killer.The movie is a classic genre movie: action. The action genre in movies is a type of film that typically features fast-paced and thrilling physical stunts, fights, and chases. In the end, you do not feel cheated.One of the dialogues: \"The bloodshed wasn't necessary. But the bloodshed was the point.\" It seems like the characters do not seek to achieve any goal or outcome by shedding blood, but rather they enjoy the act itself as an end in itself. They only care about satisfying their bloodlust and proving their dominance.We often think that action is the best way to solve our problems and achieve our goals. But is that always true? What if our actions have negative consequences or go against our moral values? These questions challenge us to think more deeply about what it means to act and how our actions affect ourselves and others.The movie has amazing and beautiful action scenes. The stunts are awesome, and, again, the gunfights look more like dance moves. Wick is always so smooth and clever when he fights.The abundance of locations and vivid colors present a visual treat that is unmatched. The vivid imagery sets the perfect tone, both for the action and the dialogue. This movie offers an exceptional sensory journey, a rare treat not often found in action films. Every frame is dripping with texture and layers. There are so many things happening in the foreground and background, and yet you are never confused about what you have to focus on.The story of John Wick, brought to life by the masterful acting of Keanu Reeves, is a tale of human suffering and redemption. Wick, once a man of simple desires, finds himself thrust into a world of violence and revenge, driven by his past traumas and the desire for retribution.Reeves understands the depth of his character's suffering and portrays Wick not as a mere killing machine, but as a man with a soul that has been wounded by loss and grief. Despite the constant physical punishment he endures, Wick never loses sight of his humanity, and his pain only serves to reinforce his determination.Through Wick's struggles, we see the timeless truth that suffering is an inherent part of the human experience.One of the key tenets of stoicism is the idea that we should be indifferent to external circumstances. This does not mean that we should be unfeeling, but rather that we should strive to maintain a sense of inner calm. John Wick embodies this idea in many ways. Despite the numerous threats he faces, he remains calm and focused.Another important principle is the idea that we should focus on what we can control, rather than worrying about what we cannot. John Wick exemplifies this idea in his single-minded pursuit of his goals. When someone threatens him, he does not waste time on fruitless worry or despair. Instead, he takes action to protect himself and those around him, using his skills and experience.In short, John Wick is not just a deadly assassin, but also a stoic philosopher. Through his actions and demeanor, he embodies many of the key principles of stoicism.John Wick 4 is action cinema turned into high art by creators who believe that every single one of the countless kills in this movie still has to look cool as hell.

But sometimes they last a little more than what they should, but this movie has much more story than its predecessors, now John Wick has more of an objective than just kill whoever tries to kill him, here, he really has a chance to be free again and with the help of other characters who also have better motivations in this one, he plans on getting it. Obviously the best thing of this movie are the fighting scenes, combined with their awesome cinematography, music and choreographys it makes for a great experience. I already talked about some some of them lasting a bit too much but that doesnt affect the film as much as it could have.

The side characters and new ones introduced are also very interesting and entertaining to watch, mainly Cain, who I hope gets a spin off or something. And all the movie is like this, the best quality of action a movie can have but stopping at the right times so it doesnt get tiring enough.

Laurence Fishborne going over the top and Keanu not saying much, but when he does he makes himself sound like he's having a stroke.Adding the black assassin dude simply as the diversity hire was a weird choice. Like seriously, he was the only black dude. The dude was a complete wild card that you had no idea whose side he was on. He was trying to kill John, but also trying to save him? Also, he had a dog to help him. Didn't Halle Berry have the exact same gimmick in the last movie that did the same trick of going for the nuts?And where was John's motivation for all of this? Why was he in Japan? Why did he kill the High Table person? Why wasn't this Marques person introduced sooner? Why was a blind assassin 20x better than any of the other assassins?

From the dialogue to the use of Nowhere to Run, it was the director's insert that, excuse the expression, proverbially killed the movie for me. I read after seeing the movie that the director wanted to homage the film but this extraneous garbage was so cringe for me.

It took me out of the film until the final scene when I was sort of able to finish the film with some assemblage of enjoyment. Sad how certain things can ruin a good thing.

When John Wick first came out in 2014, it was one of the most surprising yet most enjoyable experiences I had. What is even more amazing is that the 2 sequels it got were also amazing! We are now on the 4th entry and the question is if it continues to maintain the quality it has so far.Let's get the obvious out of the way, the action scenes are still absolutely amazing! One thing each entry in this franchise continues to do is to make the action bigger and crazier than the last. There are so many incredible actions set pieces with a roughly 30-minute action scene in Osaka with bows and swords, a stunning sequence in Paris with cars and traffic, a Hotline Miami style action sequence with overhead shots, and one of the best action sequences ever involving stairs. I give every single praise to the stunt people who worked on this as they take some very painful falls in this film. This entry is also the best-looking one in the franchise. The set design and cinematography are phenomenal. John Wick killing people has never looked as beautiful as it does here.Keanu continues to be awesome as John Wick by still doing the action choreography at the age of 57. We get to see him fight with nunchucks and shoot goons while driving a car. Ian McShane, Lance Reddick (R. I. P) and Laurence Fishburne return as Winston, Charon and the Bowery King respectively. They're all still great but have a smaller role this time. There are many new supporting characters are great as well. Donnie Yen joins the franchise as Caine, a blind assassin, who is an old friend but now foe. Donnie Yen always gives his A-game and here is no exception with how he does action as a blind character makes him interesting to watch. Hiroyuki Sanada is Koji who is the manager of the Osaka Continental Hotel who is just a badass and cool guy, Rina Sawayama makes her acting debut as Akira and she does a good job in her small role with some good action as well. Shamier Anderson plays an assassin who tracks John Wick and he also does some great action. What they do with his character is interesting but the best thing is that he has a dog which makes him 100% better. Scott Adkins plays Kilia and he does a good job as a minor antagonist. The main antagonist, Marquis Vincent, is played by Bill Skarsgard and he does a great job of being hateable.What Chapter 4 has over Chapters 2 and 3 is more emotional elements to the story. John Wick is deservingly angry after 3 but you also get to see him contemplate more about when this bloodshed will end. You see him question a lot of what he is doing and whether these conflicts that are bringing his friends into are worth it. Additionally, his relationship with Caine (Donnie Yen) adds some weight to the conflict by making close friends fight each other. The stakes in this film feel bigger as well. Some people complain about the 2-hour 45-minute runtime but the pacing never felt bad and the quieter moments are enjoyable too. If I had to give a negative then the only one, I can think of is the post-credit scene which dampens the ending a little bit.Overall, what an outstanding film! It's insane to think that even on its 4th entry, this film continues to be entertaining and somehow still amazing! Director Chad Stahelski has made an extraordinary franchise and shows everyone in Hollywood, how to make an action movie. With the inclusion of a post-credit scene, I wonder if the plan is to make a new cinematic universe which worries me a bit. There are a lot of potential spinoff ideas such as a Caine (Donnie Yen) spinoff or a Tracker spinoff (Shamier Anderson) or a spinoff with the John Wick 3 character Sofia (Halle Berry).

The rest of the movie was a parody of the firsts movies: John gets run over by cars, falls from buildings, gets stabbed multiple times and gets back up immediately like it was nothing. Also they keep making fun of the fact that John Wick has no motives to keep going. Then we have a blind Mr. Chow that almost did what hundreds of highly trained assassins with vision couldn't do all together. We have a ton of repeated action scenes from the previous movies and even in the actual movie. For exemple, why bring another assassin with a dog? They couldn't thought of another animal? Why not a bird or something? And the casting of the Marques? The actor is just a french baby. Not intimidating at all...\nTo conclude, I was expecting more realistic scenes, more real motives for John to be angry against the High Table, more charismatic characters like the German fat guy and more original fighting scenes( like in the other movies where he goes from a arms museum to a horse stable \ud83d\ude02).", "rating": 5, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 10, "votes": 19}, "heading": "John Wick: The parody", "date": "2023-03-27T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8953222"}, {"content": "The movie is a stunning visual masterpiece with intense action scenes and memorable characters that leave a lasting impression.

I must say that I am glad that they decided to go out on a high note. I heard rumors about a 5th one and that would not have been a smart move.The movie has many weaknesses. I found the story to be quite convoluted when it should have been pretty straightforward. I wish they actually showed people sitting at the High Table. It felt tiring for him to chase a ghost-like group of people with no tangible existence. But at the same time, the elder in the beginning was killed off so easily. Does this organization even matter? I feel like that's a pretty serious offense but they treated him the same as last time with about the same amount of force. Furthermore, the whole \"tracker\" role seemed absolutely pointless. He was not needed in this movie and his ambiguous stand against John Wick confused me throughout. I also found Donnie Yen's role slightly underwhelming. I understand he is blind but sometimes it felt like he didn't have that good of a hearing to compensate how well he could fight. It also made zero sense for them to be put into a duel like that if he's blind... I am suspecting that they purposefully didn't kill each other for the best outcome. John would never miss a shot given his track record. Not to mention that this possibility of the duel just being introduced when I feel like the concept would have ended the series in two movies had it been known to the audience earlier. It also seemed that John was much more invulnerable in this movie. I remember that in the previous movies, he suffered wounds. However, I don't remember him bleeding much up to the final scene. I had to suspend my beliefs many time because whoever came up to him felt so incompetent. Maybe I need to get completely immersed in more to be able to fully experience genres like this.However, I think visually this film was possibly the peak of action films. It was beautifully shot (the aerial scene was absolute pinnacle of this) with vibrant colors of the underworld. Very impressive shots here and there with the changing lights. I also thought the choreography was improved. They had many creative sequences, especially in Paris with both the Arc de Triomphe and the stairs scene. The movie also showcased recurring motives like underground club fights and crotch-biting dogs. These were some nice moments for the fans and I appreciated being able to pick them out while not being predictable.While I would have normally not given a movie like this such a high rating, I wanted to commend the decision of killing off John here. Our hero does need to rest here because he's technically free of his obligations (but all it took was one duel!). I appreciated his character arc development over the four movies. He's finally reached a point in his life where he felt like his life was complete because I am sure he could have lived if he tried to as his wounds didn't seem that bad and he's survived worse. He chose to leave his legacy as \"loving husband\" while that was a small fragment of his life. He wanted to continue living to remember his wife but perhaps he wanted to join her side because he is tired of living with the weight of his memories and consequences.I understand the praise and where it comes from but perhaps I have preferences in genres. As I continue with my reviews, I wanted to be a person that can give equally high scores on the pinnacles of different genres. But I would probably never come back to this series and those movies have to have a ceiling in their ratings.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 3}, "heading": "Such is life", "date": "2023-03-27T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8953214"}, {"content": "John Wick 4- Other than human defying logic with unlimited lifeline for John as he fires and kills 300 hitmen along with few others, and no bones breaking while stumbling down 200+ steps and getting back up/ or falling from upper floor of 100 to 200 feet, the movie works spectacularly well.Action sequences are at its peak one has ever experienced- from sword fighting to bullets flying to kick boxing.

People underestimated the first John Wick movie when it released in 2014. It just looked like another throwaway action movie with Keanu Reeves in it, but Keanu Reeves has an appeal all on his own. He has been criticized for his level of acting skill for as long he has been in the industry for since the late 80s, but he certainly isn't a terrible actor. Sure, his emotional range might not be the best of the best, but he still manages to give fine performances none the less. I thought he was pretty damn good in Speed as a passionate cop who just wanted to help people, and his anxiety outburst in The Matrix when he learns the truth was memorable as well. Anyway, people underestimated John Wick 1 and because of that, it seemed to exceed everyone's expectations as a well-directed action/revenge flick and also showcased a deeper side of Keanu's acting ability.Anyway, after the success of the first film, it was obvious that a sequel would follow, and that's exactly what happened, and then a couple of years later there was a third one and suddenly it became a trilogy! The two following movies changed tone a little bit and became more avant-garde than the original, but these two movies improved on the action and took it to new levels.Now that the fourth chapter is out, it once again brings the quality of action to new heights and now brings it closer to perfection than it ever has before. The action in this film is insanely well shot and directed and is extremely aesthetically pleasing and satisfying. The several action sequences are very lengthy too, with a couple going for over 10 minutes. The last time I saw an action sequence go for this long was in Mad Max: Fury Road almost 8 years ago, and it's pretty obvious that they took a lot of research from that film and how it was crafted. But here's a hot take, I think John Wick 4 is even better! Because unlike Fury Road, it has a story and characters that are on the same level as the action!Every character in this movie is extremely rootable and has their own weaknesses and limitations, there is a blind character in this movie who is an extremely good fighter... but he's still blind and uses sound emitting sensors that he sticks to the walls, so he knows exactly where his enemies are in space, and I thought that was a very nice touch. John Wick himself is also very skilled at hand-to-hand fighting and shooting, but he also isn't a perfect fighting god and will be outsmarted sometimes. The Yakuza leader who ran the hotel in Osaka was great too, and his character was also built in the same way where he had his own strengths and weaknesses.The characters are also very compelling and is clearly shown what each one is struggling with and also showing just how broken as a man Wick is at this point. A certain character changes sides but I won't spoil who. Also, the villain was also pretty good as well. He didn't really have that much of an understandable motivation; he was just ruthless and nasty and that's all he really needed to be. You don't need to explain an antagonist all the time, sometimes they can just be evil for the sake of being evil and that's fine and can also work as being entertaining. He was an intimidating presence, unlike Agent Smith in Matrix Resurrections which was a joke compared to Hugo Weaving.Anyway, I was completely blown away by just how good the action was in this and just how long it went on for without becoming boring. It might just be one of my new all-time Action Favorites and highly recommend that you go see this on the big screen with the best sound.

I saw a lot of the more negative reviews saying this film felt more Bond esc than John Wick, going into the film I didn't understand what they meant but now I completely get it. John Wick first premiered in theatres 9 years ago and was a small hearty revenge tale action film that over time picked up a large audience of fans (me included). Much like any film that picks up a fan base it gets a sequel and now we're 4 films deep and going back to the whole bond thing this feels like the 4th film in an action film franchise and by that I mean everything is bigger, bigger and more stars, bigger and longer action set pieces and a bigger and more complex plot. Bigger however doesn't always mean better it's about what you do with it and what these films have done is turned into a franchise in every sense of the word. Lost is that small revenge thriller feel of the first film and now we have over the top villains like Bill Skarsgard who comes across as less menacing and more spoilt brat. We also have a protagonist that feels invincible at points laughably so, for instance John jumps out of a third floor window at one point lands on his back on top of a van and almost instantly gets up and walks off. There were a few of these 'yeah right' moments and they really took me out of the film temporarily. That being said however the film is far from a total lost, Donnie Yen is by far the stand out addition to the franchise, he steals every scene he's in and I definitely have a craving to go and watch more of his earlier work now. The action sequences despite being over the top at points are as slick and well choreographed as they were in the previous films and almost feel like a dance just a bloody and brutal one. The ending is also really solid and something we haven't seen before in a John Wick film, the film definitely leaves you on a high note.I definitely enjoyed this film but compared to the other John Wick films it's down there with three as one of the weaker entries in the franchise for me.I hope they stick with four films and that it doesn't get anymore over the top as after all\nNobody does it better than Bond.", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 2}, "heading": "It's got iconic John Wick lines such as my personal favourite'Yeah'", "date": "2023-03-26T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8952987"}, {"content": "To many poor decisions.

Hiroyuki Sanada as Shimazu Koji: the manager of the Osaka Continental Hotel and an old friend of John Wick. It also stars Shamier Anderson, Rina Sawayama and Scott Adkins.The premise goes like this: John Wick uncovers a path to defeating The High Table. But before he can earn his freedom, Wick must face off against a new enemy with powerful alliances across the globe and forces that turn old friends into foes.Let's dig deeper into the story and what sequences I liked the most, I have a weak spot for samurai movies and the Osaka Continental offers just that.

It's always nice to see a new Continental and this one sure felt special, you notice what friendship John Wick and Shimazu Koji has. The action sequence was great! But my favorite city and action sequences are found in Paris, it has the biggest importance to the story, it brought so many memorable moments. It shows why Keanu Reeves was and is right to lead this franchise. Paris is also the city where Marquis Vincent de Gramont is located and he becomes the highest-ranking member of The High Table during this film. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd holds one of the strongest performances in the film as the Marquis. Keanu Reeves holds the best though, maybe not the best dramatic performance but certainly overall performance as he does his own stunts alongside everything else, and the stunts are incredible. Donnie Yen was great and possibly even one of the best things of the movie, both his knowledge in martial arts but also his character which I loved. The performance that surprised me was Shamier Anderson as the mysterious bounty hunter, it's a great character that they could do so much with and I can easily say the same for Donnie Yen and Hiroyuki Sanada's characters. One of the final action sequences was all in a one take, except for a quick cut before moving back to the one take. It was shot with a camera above, letting us see everything happening from above and moving with John Wick as he fires inside an abandoned building.Chad Stahelski truly directed an action film that'll be remembered for decades, his direction in both the action and more dramatic scenes are all brilliant. There's so many fight sequences in this film, small like big, all directed and shot brilliantly. The screenplay was done by Shay Hatten and Michael Finch, I don't have any problem with it, it's good and for a Wick film it holds the same quality. The movies aren't about the best writing in Hollywood, it's about what happens on the screen, blood being spilled. Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard returned to compose the score for the film, after doing so for the previous three films. Like Shay Hatten had done too.I have read various of critics and some people complaining about the length, Chapter 4 has a runtime of 169-minutes. Its long, full of beautiful looking shots that does nothing to the story, only to create atmosphere and suspense where it succeeds. There are scenes that you could easily trim, yes, but I still found the length to be perfect. I want to see the 3 hour 49 minute version just because of how great the film was, but the theatrical version is magnificent. Chapter 4 is all about tying up loose ends, to finally find peace and freedom. It's a long road to that point, Chad uses the film's length for just that, to tell a bigger and deeper story than a simple story. More run time also means for more action sequences!This might be the best film of the four, both action and drama, also most beautiful in regards of the camera work and cinematography. Dan Laustsen truly knows his craft, making each scene absolutely mesmerizing to look at! I loved every second of it, when I saw it at the cinema, a woman (a mother) sat beside the person I was there with and said how brutal it was... She was five minutes in and the first action scene had only just started. Jokes aside, John Wick: Chapter 4 has some of the franchise's best action sequences and Keanu Reeves at his best. Like his role in The Matrix, John \"Baba Yaga\" Wick will be another role he'll be remembered for.

Instead he's the main character in a video game and you're watching a Twitch stream of someone talented playing all the way through to the final boss.At one point this characteristic is cemented, in spectacular fashion, when the camera shifts to a top-down view and you get to watch John move from room to room in a bloody spree. It's a fantastic sequence, right down to the spray of blood as henchmen #89 gets shot in the head at close range.So is it a great film?

Not only have the films created longer, more unique, and brutal action scenes, but they have increasingly developed the John Wick world. The audience showing their love for the unrealistic has propelled the franchise to lean more towards the absurdity, and deepening the John Wick world into that where normality in John Wick 4 is impossible in the real world.Approaching the 4th chapter, you have to accept the rules in the John Wick world, not as faults in the screenplay, but as a necessary characteristic of storytelling that supports the extensive action scenes that we come to expect. John Wick 4's success is measured in how it succeeds with what it wants to fulfill for the audience, which is a stunning visual/auditory experience mixed with extended fun action scenes. The story between action is more about using characters and their methodology to expand your knowledge of this world. Sure, John has a goal, but it's purposely 3rd nature as it more or less is shaped by others around him.None of the movies have cared much about a deep story. John Wick 4 carries this tradition as well as seeing if it can succeed by moving the goal posts to see how far they can take the action. The lengthy run time flies by, thereby exemplifies how well the film succeeds with the action. It answers the question how could the other movies be topped.

It would actually have been fun to include them in the final scene, but what do I know?My real problem with this film though is that JOHN WICK 4 is so detached from any kind of reality it makes it a rightful candidate for the fantasy genre, what with its HIGHLANDER-friendly references to \"consecrated grounds\", love of stylish church interiors and absurdly invincible, nearly-immortal characters. Ok I actually kind of like that part, and I expect new installments to reveal that Da Vinci, Rambaldi (ALIAS) or the Knights Templar started the High Table organization, which would be fun.No, my real quibble is when the gun play becomes so fantastic than they can shoot each other repeatedly at close range and keep fighting as though this were a superhero-type action flick. They lost me after about 15 mn of story when that kind of nonsense started, in Osaka. I did enjoy some brilliant John Woo-like choreography (the overhead sequence shot most of all), but nonsense like that really spoiled the fun for me (and for the Paris audience who giggled when Wick keeps falling down the Montmartre stairs - there's no way this could happen in real life).This is a classic case of sequilitis really, with bigger, louder and absurder as the guiding principles.

Well, I can't quite agree with the praise.The film is clearly too long, the action scenes all get out of hand and you only see more of the same killing scenes, which are boring and tough in the long run. Less would have been more here.Attention, there are a few spoilers to a few fight scenes.Chapter 4 takes the \"nonsense\" to the extreme again. I'm a fan of well choreographed fights, but not when it's just overplayed to the max. John Wick once again fights HORDES of assassins and walking fortresses, but they are all too stupid to hit John and always miss. It's also interesting that John Wick must think he's Neo, since he's constantly \"dodging\" bullets by ducking and taking slight sideways steps. By John being invincible, it's just not fun to watch him kill, because it's unsatisfying victory, kind of like a cheat in a game or some kind of god mode. It would have been much more intense and emotional for me as a viewer if John was significantly more vulnerable and if there had been more noticeable character development and motivation. It would have been enough to reduce the kill count from over 200 to under 20, but to stage the individual fights more brutally, more intensively and, above all, more realistically and credibly (e.g. As in Atomic Blonde or Mission: Impossible).I also find these \"armored\" suit guys stupid. John often shoots whole magazines at these guys, and the bullets bounce off the suit as if the outer fabric was already made of 1 cm steel. But the fact that the suit guys are still very agile is even more laughable. And the suits are still as clean and intact as if they had just been bought and ironed. These suit guys don't have head protection, though, which is why I find it ridiculous that John imemr shoots at their bodies and not directly at their heads. He seems to be shortsighted, because he only ever shoots at the head when he's extremely close to the enemy. However, when enemies wear complete body armor including ballistic helmets, John strangely always shoots at their heads even from a distance, until after ten or fifteen shots he finally shoots into the helmet/head from below. If you multiply these kind of kills by 100, you have an idea of how often John kills hundreds of killers in the same way.Furthermore, I find it very nonsensical that there are no police in the world who intervene at times.The scene in Paris at this big traffic circle with several lanes is also totally crazy. John and the killers shoot at each other on the traffic circle for over ten minutes, and the \"civilians\" just drive on like robots at 50 km/h and just keep running over some killers and John, though John never takes any damage from it. But no one stops, gets out and runs away in fear. The traffic keeps flowing, despite wild killing by shooting and wild running over.As for the staging of the action scenes: For every well-staged action scene, there are unfortunately three mediocre and boring action scenes that always follow the same pattern, see my comments above. And even the best action scenes are not necessarily as \"groundbreaking\" or \"novel\" and \"groundbreaking\" as some critics claim. I found a whole two action scenes very successful, once the much too short! (where all the others are way too long) chase scene in the Mustang and once the top-down fight scene. The highly praised staircase fight scene I found again much too long and also very 08/15, because John again makes his always same kills, while all the others always hit only the staircase railings or lanterns, but not John.The story isn't worth mentioning and doesn't make much sense in terms of content. Interestingly enough, the nice dialogues and dialogue scenes are still one of the best things about the movie.The sound is well mixed though, the camerawork is well done and the visuals are very aesthetically pleasing and there are a few nice references to Matrix (rain fight scene and the train station).Now all of this sounds rather like a poor or mediocre rating, but that wouldn't do the film justice. It offers good entertainment on a technical level above mediocrity and Keanu Reeves is always fun to watch.

It's precisely as expected: brutal in some ways, artful in others. Unfortunately, at certain points you really have to wonder if they ran out of choreographers when the fights seem to drag on rather excessively and without much variation. Improvised weaponry was rarer than before, and you'd kind of expect some variety in it. Most of all, some of the choreography is downright lazy. There are points in fight scenes where men wearing Kevlar lined 3 piece suits take multiple bullets, which make little sparks and they're otherwise unfazed. They wrote John this absurd trick where he holds up his suit jacket like Batman's cape and now he's magically immune to bullets. Each movie departed from realism a bit more; this chapter just threw it in the trash. It's just a superhero movie without powers.Now the story, on the other hand, leaves much more to be desired. The pacing is incredibly slow, to the point where you sometimes just lose the plot entirely. Very few familiar characters spend more than a few minutes on screen, and the new characters who hog the spotlight are shallow and forgettable.Lastly, the pacing is awful, in some part due to the large run time. Fight scenes drag on far too long, while most conversations are so short and unsubstantial that they might as well not have occurred at all.

Keanu reeves is excellent, a little older but smooth and has given a 100% to every scene.The movie runs quickly without wasting too much time on building narrative, most of it is simple, clear and precise. Is it realistic? NO, but you did come to watch JW4 so just enjoy the ride.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 3}, "heading": "A violent ballet", "date": "2023-03-26T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8952459"}, {"content": "While I don't generally rate more recent films higher as they haven't stood the test of time yet John Wick Chapter 4 is an exception. It has a far better story than parts 2 and 3 due to John having a more personal motivation for his typical antics. Chapter 4 also benefits from the best action sequences of the series, In parts 1, 2 and 3 there have to me only been one or two standout action scenes; the club fight in the first the entire Italy concert/catacombs sequence in the second and the Continental hotel siege in the third. John Wick 4 on the other hand has huge fight in a hotel in Osaka, a nightclub showdown blowing the one from the first out of the water and finally the final part of the film is literally non stop action around Paris In which there's a car chase around the arc de triomphe which quickly turns into a fight in which John throws people into the oncoming traffic, a Hotline Miami style top down shootout with and finally a long fight up a tall staircase. The fourth chapter of the franchise also has the best supporting cast since the original including a brilliant Donnie Yen and the series best villain in Bill Skarsgard.

Nevertheless, this movie in some form undoes what previous chapters have painfully built.The story is unnecessarily convoluted and way too long to be entertaining. Motivations come and go, with no real substance rather than to keep the plot running. Most annoyingly perhaps is that action scenes feel somewhat recycled. For instance whatever was cool about animals in chapters 2 and 3 is rehashed here to little innovative effect. Even the actual physical setting: an early scene in the movie takes place in what felt like a too familiar museum-type of place with lots of neon lights and warrior masks and armors behind glass boxes. It's like things that were cool and worked out previously are just brought again. Lots of characters that are important to the plot, appear and disappear without having ever been mentioned before, creating some horrendous plot holes. All in all, it seems that there is so much that is forced and just \"more of the same\" cash-generating formula.All of this would have been overlooked, if the characters were a little more real and less \"Fast and the Furious.\" By this I mean that the action scenes and apparent immortality of certain actors have so much more in common with Vin Diesel and his gang than with earlier John Wick movies. No one important dies easily and there's a point that the logic of how someone can just keep going defies any common sense. Nothing feels at stake since you feel throughout the movie that John Wick will just keep going, not by sheer spirit and determination (as it was before) but rather by super-human abilities that, let's be honest, are just dumb.As an audience member, I felt to some extent disrespected. The action and story in itself is so ilogical that there is no reason anymore to think more about any of these characters. Ian McShane's gravitas is lost. He's just playing the same role, saying the same things, looking cool, but adding so little. Same goes for Morpheus, sorry, Laurence Fishburne, who just do the same he did but somehow now in a different location.All in all, a franchise that ran out of ideas and while beautifully filmed and with some exciting scenes, defies logic in so many ways it is hard to keep yourself interested or invested.", "rating": 5, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 7, "votes": 14}, "heading": "No longer a movie with a soul", "date": "2023-03-26T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8952394"}, {"content": "Contains spoilers.I watched all 4 parts one by one in cinema.

Yeah, it had French subtitles and was interrupted a few times with ads for a lottery in India. But I was able to speed up the dull parts, slow down and replay the action scenes. The only thing I couldn't see was a special scene after the credits, as this version ended just before the credits began.If you saw the previous three chapters, you can appreciate that they upped the choreographic level of the fight scenes; the death total easily pushes into the hundreds. Some of it seems gratuitous (OK, it's almost all gratuitous) but it sets a cinematic bar for this kind of lethal action that will likely never be matched.Some of the locations (Osaka, Berlin, Paris) seem to have been picked solely for their aesthetics, as in the previous film that took the action out of New York. How this guy gets to instantly zip around the world without being noticed (except by one or two trackers who seem to get to where he winds up even before he does) is almost as mystifying as how he manages to fall multiple times from several stories up, or get hit by cars multiple times, or tumble down dozens of Parisian steps leading to Sacre Couer de Montmartre Church more than once (why did I suddenly think of Laurel & Hardy's classic \"The Music Box\" -- the one with the piano repeatedly going up and down the long stairs -- while watching this?) and nobody seems smart enough to fire at him from a safe distance while behind a safe barrier. Simple rule... if you get within ten feet of Wick, you are dead. Hey, remember that he can kill with a pencil? Here he attacks a guy with a playing card! Oh, and he gets to use nunchucks for the first time. Lots of bodies breaking through glass, but going through it never seems to cause any cuts.It is still implausible that so many supposed professional hit men are so easily dispatched and seem unable to get even one good head shot in out of the hundreds of tries.I won't give away the assumed ending, which is both logical and anti-climactic, yet since I didn't see the post-credits scene, I have to wonder if it's a ruse to allow for more of the franchise, seeing as how each film makes more money than the one before it. With this film, the longest of the four, being nearly three hours long, I can only imagine that any fifth film will require bladders of titanium and include a body count in the thousands.Reeves has even fewer lines here than in any of the previous shorter films, mostly just saying \"Yeah\" a lot. He and most of the others talk in epigrams and fortune-cookie-style one-liners meant to sound deep, but usually just come across as goofy or puzzling.The tracker known as Mr. Nobody has a dog trained to attack on command, similar (almost identical) to Halle Berry's dogs in Chapter 3. When he says \"Nuts\" the dog goes for, well, you can guess where. At least five times. When Wick prevents the dog from getting shot (we know how important dogs are to the franchise) Mr. Nobody rethinks his entire raison. Seems his dog's life was worth more than 40 million dollars. But then, killing a pup is the original sin that started this entire franchise!Some parts are better than the whole. Some parts make little or no sense. Not a single cop is ever seen no matter how much violence ensues; indeed, in several places, while guns are blazing and swords are swinging, the civilians just act as if nothing is happening, and make no attempt to flee. So much is a cross between cartoonish -- several Wiley-Coyote-style falls, minus the anvil, but still no apparent injuries -- and video game choreography (there's even a god's-eye-view tracking shot that clearly was lifted from an actual video game).I'm told that the classic 1979 New York action film \"The Warriors\" was the template for this film, with Wick substituting for an entire NYC gang trying to make it home. In an outright theft, they even have a black female DJ's closeup mouth to the mic smugly following Wick's trip across the city, exactly as in the earlier film (Lynne Thigpen did it better; oh, those lips!).If you've seen the previous three films, and appreciate what was done superlatively, and overlooked the implausibles and recycled tropes, I guess you will have to see Chapter 4 for whatever supposed closure it may or may not offer. When someone catches the post-credits scene, please let me know what was in it, as I'm pretty sure it's the key to how Chapter 5 begins.Yeah... a franchise film that debuts at $72 million (almost double the last bounty on Wick's life), the best start of the whole series, isn't going to toss away the opportunity to rake in even more.

Of course Avatar was beautiful and had some great visual effects but it didn't have me at the edge of my seat. John Wick: Chapter 4 really turned out to be a great sequel amidst all of us wondering if they were stretching the franchise too much.This movie purely stands out from its predecessors and also from most of the action movies these days because of its 'execution' (see what I did there ;-)). The story isn't anything really out of the box and it is yet again John Wick running away (and killing away) from the lot trying to kill him including the high table. The screenplay is very engaging and it almost acts like going through different levels of a game before meeting the final boss. The action set pieces are very well executed just like many other John Wick movies, but in this film the attention to detail to some of the action is at a different level. I ended up laughing at some of the action sequences just because how outrageous they were and in a good way. My brain was just unable to comprehend that level of awesomeness. The fight scene in a Berlin nightclub is probably one of the best action sequences in a movie and the background score makes it special. The action sequence around Arc De Triomphe is ridiculously good and makes you feel like you are in a fantasy ride. The cinematography is outstanding and offers some very creative perspectives in some scenes, which are worth the big screen experience. Background score and music selection is near perfect and as mentioned this film checks pretty much all the boxes in the technical departments. Another big highlight of the movie is the choice of beautiful locations. The filmmakers have made sure to give a new experience despite choosing many of the mainstream action movie locations.There isn't much that does not work for the movie. The script isn't very new and I personally feel that some parts of the plot weren't really justifying what happened next. Sometimes, the action sequences may feel a bit too streched but that is mainly dependent on an individual's taste.Donnie Yen's characterization as Caine might feel inconsistent at times related to his abilities. It also reminds you of Chirut Imwe from Rogue one but the chemistry between him and John Wick works out for better eventually. While Bill Skarsgard's character is intentionally obnoxious and irritating, it doesn't really create any kind of a significant threat. The antagonist and supporting roles are very well written and never get overshadowed by John Wick. Clancy Brown as Harbinger in a small role is very impactful and Marko Zaror as Chidi, the right hand man of the main antagonist is immense. Scott Adkins as a heavily prosthetic Killa offers a unique comic relief but also a unique resistance to John Wick. Hiroyuki Sanada is his usual best even in a small role and Rina Sawayama as Akira is definitely a future star in the making. Old timers and franchise veterans Ian McShane and Laurence Fishburne are pleasant as always. And the main man himself, Keanu Reeves, offers great depth to the character and delivers as many punches as he can but very few lines ;-)\nLast but not the least \"the concierge\" Lance Reddick (god rest his soul) delivers one last classy short performance with his trademark deep voice.John Wick Chapter 4 is a stylish, compelling and an unapologetic action flick which makes for a great theatrical experience.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Definitely belongs to the high table of sequels ;-)", "date": "2023-03-26T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8952091"}, {"content": "Once a series gets to it's 4th installment - and that installment is NOT a reboot or \"prequel\" - the audience for said series is pretty much settled in. There is a rabid group of movie-going watchers that are looking for the intimate details and Easter Eggs to further their immersion into this world while the rest of the movie going public has probably moved on and, just might, check it out on a whim.Such is the case with JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 4 - the 4th installment of the Keanu Reeves led/Chad Stahelski Directed series that is long on style, action, intrigue and mythology while being low on logical plot-lines and...well...daylight.But this won't matter to the John Wick movie-goer. They are getting more of the same - cartoon violence professionally created by Stahelski and Reeves with plenty of bad guys battling (and losing) to Wick while the mysterious, underground society that Wick has run afoul of tries to take him down.This insider intrigue will be enriching for the true John Wick fan but will be inconsequential for the casual movie-goer as these plot machinations are just an excuse to line Reeves up against seemingly insurmountable obstacle after seemingly insurmountable obstacle.And what a journey it is. Starting with a tussle at the Osaka Continental (featuring veteran Martial Artists Hiroki Sanada and Donnie Yen) to a battle in Germany to the final in Paris, JOHN WICK: CHAPTER 4 is just one, long stylized fight sequence with both Stahelski (the Director and Fight Choreographer) and Reeves (as Wick) showing off their talents in new and interesting ways.There are way too many fight sequences to mention, but there is one sequence in a building that is shot from on high (reminiscent of watching video game play) that is the most interesting/effective - but they all are a ton of fun.Bill Skarsgard (Pennywise the Clown in the IT movies) is along as the Marquis (cool name) who is in charge of bringing Wick down. He is joined by the always good Clancy Brown (the voice of Mr. Krabs on Spongebob) on the \"bad guy\" side while Wick regulars Ian McShane, Lawrence Fishburne and the late, great Lance Reddick line up on Wick's side.It is a fun roller-coaster ride - if a bit long at almost 3 hours (the middle sags a bit) - that will entertain casual fans of action flicks while satisfying the hard-core \"Wick-aphiles\" (if that is a term) with a further peeling back of a layer of this world.Letter Grade: A-8 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 3}, "heading": "More of the same - which is a GOOD thing", "date": "2023-03-26T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8952085"}, {"content": "The movie is worth the wait.

He is a true inspiration, proving that age is just a number. The guy is in his 50's and is pulling off amazing choreographed action sequences. The action sequences are incredible.

Bill Skarsgards villainous role as one of the heads of The High Table is menacing, cold and calculating. He pulls the strings of the plot all the way to the end. Donnie Yen yet again plays another blind badass character. This time a hitman who has history with Wick, and a motive that forces him into hunting Wick down. A very cool and compelling character that I hope to see more of later on.The two hour and forty minute runtime went by like a breeze, captivating from the very beginning to the somber bittersweet ending. A satisfying conclusion to John Wicks story, as he was finally at peace with everything and returned home to his wife. I hope his story stays concluded, even though nowadays it seems like no one truly stays dead.In light of the conclusion I can honestly conclude that John Wick: Chapter 4 is one of the greatest action movies of all time.

One action scene is shot in a way that looks like a live-action version of Hotline Miami, and the results are pretty great. There's also some really good music used throughout, including Justice's Genesis (not the only on-the-nose music choice, given they're a French House duo and the scene it plays during takes place in Paris, but it fits the heightened style of the movie).You do feel the length at some points, and I don't think it's the best-paced recent blockbuster with a three-ish hour-long runtime.

Wardrobe, foley, set designers, editors, and MUAs were all the best of the best.And yet the movie was a complete waste of time. I want it to make money for all involved, but I can't say that it was a good movie by any stretch of the imagination.The American fetishization of guns was in full force here, as was the American hyperbole: \"Make it bigger, make it crazier, make it more wacky.\" This film had all of that, but...character development? Forget about it. A plot that made sense? No way. An emotional through line? Barely.It's true that we care about John Wick. We became invested in him four movies ago when they killed his dog. But watching this film is like watching that dog race around the room covered in tinsel and holidays lights, barking at shadows.How many real-world problems can be solved by shooting something in the head? Twice? How many different ways to kill do we really need depicted on a seventy-five-foot screen? How much more glorification of psychotic criminal behavior must we really witness before we ourselves become psychotic?This movie is like porn for gun nuts or for people who feel that they can punch their way out of their problems. There's a certain comedy about this that is kind of endearing. But it's just too much. There's a recurring theme that John can't escape whom he is and so he should stop trying. Is that what we should do as well? God, I hope there's more to life than that nihilism.The best scene in the film embraced a Sisyphean ideal that, in its absurdity, was worth viewing. And maybe that's the point. Maybe John Wick is just crazy enough to make us stop and ask, \"Are we the crazy ones for viewing this? Can we ever be anything more?

John Wick 2 was also a really good movie ( In my opinion ) After John Wick 3, it starts to lean more and more towards the action side and not focus so much on everything else.John Wick 4 is a relatively long film. I think a total of 2 hours just fighting and shooting duels.John Wick becomes a bit too much of a superhero in the sense that he lives being run down countless times, falls 20 meters onto the edge of the roof of a car. And the sequels he gets up and walks away.What I liked about the old movies is that he was Badass but it was still realistic. He kills 150 people in John Wick 4. It's becoming too much of a superhero movie for my taste.Another thing that I thought was mysteriously thought by the director. Is that when they shoot and throw axes at each other's heads in a nightclub, almost no one reacts to it.And when they shoot with machine guns and other weapons in the middle of the road around The Arc de Triomphe are there no cars that speeds up or slows down. It is as if they are not there at all.John Wick 4 is like riding a roller coaster.

There are some stunts that are fresh from the oven, it's the first time it's been done in the history of filmmaking. The pacing is frenetic and the action sequences are jaw-droppingly awesome, you'll never get enough of them.A special shoutout to the cinematography team. Every time Mr Wick is punching, kicking, smashing and every other verb you can think of, the cameras have their ways of putting us on a ride; like a curious kid standing close only feet apart watching everything happening before his eyes. It is breathtaking, it is vibrant and it really feels like we're there with John Wick.Some may ask if the franchise is getting ridiculous since it has now come to the 4th entry. Well, it may have come a long way as the start of the franchise was a revenge made because of a dog and a car but we will deny anyone saying it's starting to become like the F&F saga. John Wick 4 still very much relevant and it stays true to what the franchise is about, but only this time it is bigger, bolder and more brutal.Chapter 4 does not only offer violent fighting pieces, but somewhere in-between, you will find a meaningful and fascinating story of humanity. The thematic elements of friends, family and honor are the central aspects, proving that even with its bloodbath, pornfest of violence, the movie still cares about pouring its heart and love from these human values that we cherish.Focusing only on a few characters, their motives and agendas are what made the story moves forward. Each character has something they want or need to do to survive and the stakes are high because everyone here is formidable.However, because there isn't many long-running characters left, it may be a drag for some audience. John Wick 4 isn't the same like the other 3, it is heavier, bloodier, and its neo-noir looks are refined and richer, it'll make you feel you're watching Blade Runner 2049 instead. Some will appreciate its tonal shift but others won't accept the new look, feel and heavy-themed stories.We cannot overlook at the fact that some action scenes are heavily choreographed to the extent that it may take away some of the good experiences as you may be aware of the idea that it looks staged. Yes, all John Wick films have great stunt choreography and there are times where it felt like they overdid some scenes, putting them in a way that felt like it's not realistic. However, this entry has the most unnaturally stage-like scenes especially the first major battle scene that takes place in a building.A lot might disagree with our opinion here but man, do we feel that the action here isn't enough. 2 hours 49 mins but there are only 3 major fighting scenes. We love all of them but honestly, we're expecting so much more. We went in thinking that the fighting part will take about 70% of the movie, with a lot of early reviews saying that it is a non-stop action film. But we're let down by the amount of action scenes. So folks, don't go in with a high expectation that there's gonna be a lot of fights. There are plenty but it's just isn't enough for us. We want more.Verdict: Defining the action genre, John Wick Chapter 4 offers an orgy of violence, nail-biting kinetic action sequences that will set the bar for the rest of the one man army movies in decades to come.

The first half of the film felt like a serious of contrived action scenes. The Japanese segment droned on for at least twenty minutes just for Wick's old friend to be unnecessarily killed for dramatic effect.Then when the viewer is about to abandon all hope of any central storyline, it's revealed Wick can win his freedom by challenging Illuminati guy to a duel. Fair enough. What followed was another 30 minutes of fight scenes just for our guy to technically qualify for the duel.In the end Wick wins his freedom but he's shot up and presumably dies thereby invalidating the characters whole motivation during the whole film. If death was an accepting ending for him why didn't he just kill himself?Keanu Reeves looks old, tired, and depressed throughout much of this film. He talks slow and at times I wonder if he has early dementia. He's definitely not in his prime anymore and it shows. I'm of the opinion that action stars out of their prime should hang up the gloves and avoid intense action roles. They embarass themselves by providing a less impactful performance than what they were previously capable of.My favorite thing about this movie was the avoidance of shaky-cam. All the action scenes use steady-cam shots which allow the viewer to fully take in and understand the scene.

These John Wick movies usually have great fight sequences, good visuals and pulsing soundtracks - that's why we keep coming back, so let's see whether Chapter 4 delivers.Do I really need to explain the plot of John Wick: Chapter 4? It is very much a continuation of what has come before. Keanu Reeves returns as assassin-extraordinaire, John Wick. Wick runs afoul to the High Table once again, which puts him back on their radar. The High Table holds Winston (Ian McShane) accountable for John Wick's actions and puts another bounty on Wick's head. John Wick goes from location to location and from elaborate action sequence to even more elaborate action sequence for more than 2 and a half hours to avoid death and gain freedom. Gun-toting hijinks ensue.First, John Wick: Chapter 4 is too long. There is no reason for this movie to be almost 3 hours long. The plot is not that intricate. In fact, it is basically the same as all of the other movies, except the first one, which was really driven by the grief and revenge of the John Wick. Two hours definitely would have gotten the job done. Even though the action sequences are entertaining, they can get overlong and become very exhausting. I can't imagine being Keanu running from place to place, fighting, shooting and falling all over the place. Bless his heart. No wonder he sounds so out of breath.What you really came to John Wick: Chapter 4 for is what it delivers in spades: exquisitely elaborate action set pieces. The movie takes place all over the world, and each location looks beautiful and interesting. There is such ornate and complicated set design, and you know it's especially fragile so it can get destroyed with all of the shooting and fighting. And, these sets do, indeed, get destroyed. There a multiple shoot outs that take 20 minutes, or more, each. It can get fatiguing because once you've seen one shoot out then you've seen them all, but John Wick: Chapter 4 shows that not all elaborate shoot outs are alike. Thankfully, this movie has a good sense of humor as well.Ultimately, John Wick: Chapter 4 delivers the action, dry humor, beautiful shots and elaborate set pieces that we have come to expect from this franchise. Keanu Reeves shows up and puts himself through it. While the story is basically the same as all of the other John Wick movies, it is still as entertaining as ever with clever stunts and even some good musical moments. I'd say it's totally worth a trip to theater with a big box of popcorn.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "John Wick: Chapter 4 Shoots and Shoots and Shoots Some More", "date": "2023-03-26T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8951051"}, {"content": "Honestly, I feel like the title to this review is enough.

Yes, this is getting THAT live-action cartoonish.I loved it, but there hasn't been a bad John Wick movie. In fact, after writing this review, I want to compile a best/most consistent Action franchises of all-time list. This series will HAVE to be at/near the top of the greats. Four movies in, four incredible feats.Now, like I said above, this is getting pretty far-fetched. YES, John's survived countless ordeals, shots, hits and of course, heads-up battles with cars in the past 3 movies. Unfortunately, with this outing, they had me almost say, \"enough\" by the time the climax is over.That all said, maybe I was too harsh with comparing this to the horribly over-the-top Fast & Furious films which are so fathomly unrealistic, I hated most of the movies in that series. I couldn't possibly even dislike any of the John Wicks. But...it is getting a little too hard to suspend disbelief.So, John's in a pickle. When has he not been since his dog and car were taken from him in 2014? John must face many bosses before the climax and you can bet he'll be battling much of the almost-three-hour runtime.The more I think about this, the more I like it. It is NOT perfect, and I would certainly rank 1 and 3 higher. Still, you need to see this if you're a fan.As mentioned, this is nearly three hours. Mercifully, it does NOT feel that way. Well, for the most part. I examined a few scenes that dragged out longer than they should have and they were some of the non-action scenes, of course. Everything else: you're just along for the glorious ride of watching John Wick fight countless henchmen to reach his goal.While it doesn't have the depth of 1 or the Halle Berry of 3, it's a worthy chapter in an otherwise fantastic franchise. It's also pretty good looking and has some incredible side characters with complex motives that I absolutely LOVED. In fact, the more the movie went along, the more I loved how they kept the two main side characters fresh for the three acts.I do hope there's a John Wick: Chapter 5, but if it ends here, I'm totally fine. I mean, they kept trying to reboot TV's 24 after it's exciting and conclusive 8 initial seasons and that was a huge mistake.John Wick's rep established in the first one holds up here.

While every film in this franchise has been absolutely great, John Wick: Chapter 4 has changed the action genre in films as we know it, bringing everything it could possibly give us to the franchise and more. This movie had action and stunts that I never thought could be possible until viewing this movie and it did not disappoint. After taking a hard hit and recovering from the events of John Wick: Chapter 3 Parabellum, Keanu Reeves returns once again as John Wick to take down any assassin that comes his way and put a end to the manhunt against him by challenging a lead member of the high table to a duel that will either earn him his freedom or could be the end of the Boogeyman. The antagonist in this film Marquis de Gramont played by Bill Skarsgard is absolutely menacing in this role, while bringing us not only a antagonist the franchise hasn't seen before, but also unlike any character Bill Skarsgard has played before. Out of all the newest cast members to come to this film, Donnie Yen was a absolute standout as Caine, a blind assassin and old acquaintance of John Wick's whose ordered by Marquis to hunt him down or suffer the consequences. Shimazu played by Hiroyuki Sanada I also thought was a great addition to the cast after seeing his performance in Bullet Train. The character I was not expecting to like that I thought was also a highlight of the film was Tracker played by Shamier Anderson. He was probably one of my favorite characters to come to the franchise and I hope we see him again in the John Wick Universe in the future. I was glad to see Lawrence Fishburne's Bowery King return as well as Ian McShane's Winston. I was also very happy to see Lance Reddick return one last time as Charon after his sudden passing right before the release of the film. He may of not have had a lot of screentime, but the last scene he was in I felt was closure for not only Lance Reddick, but his character as well. There is no doubt in my mind that this film will go down in history as one of the greatest action films of all time. John Wick: Chapter 4 is hands down one of the most action packed I've ever seen, while also being one of the best I've seen in a long time that was made carefully with the end result being one of the best action film to be released in the past decade.

For me, it all became a bit too much, the action rapidly becoming too frenetic and over-the-top. By Parabellum (part three), I had had enough.I hoped that the four years between Parabellum and this fourth entry in the franchise had given me a big enough breather that I might be able to find new appreciation for the excessive mayhem. If anything, I found Chapter 4 even more tiresome: the fight scenes, as technically excellent as they are, simply don't know when to quit, and they're even more ridiculous than ever. Wick has been established as a semi-mythical being (Baba Yaga), seemingly impervious to pain and injury, meaning that the character is never in any real peril, which generates zero jeopardy or excitement. If anything, the relentless action scenes result in boredom, being mind-numbingly repetitive and far-fetched (the whopping 2 hours 49 minutes runtime doesn't help).Director Chad Stahelski pushes plausibility way beyond breaking point with a protracted melee amidst the traffic around the Arc De Triomphe that somehow fails to attract the attention of the Paris gendarmerie; an even more dumb scene (in a film packed with dumb scenes) sees nightclub revellers continuing to dance while people are being shot and axed to death all around them. The final act - a duel between John and blind warrior Caine (Donnie Yen) - takes place outside the Basilica of Sacr\u00e9-Coeur de Montmartre at dawn, with not a single tourist or passerby to alert the authorities of what is occurring.I've been known to enjoy comic-book action films that aren't exactly grounded in reality, but John Wick 4 seems to take place in an alternate universe where none of our rules apply. Since very little of what we see in this film can be believed, I definitely don't swallow the idea that John Wick is actually dead at the end (although I sincerely hope he is).Those claiming that this is the best action film ever made have clearly never seen The Raid 2 (or any early John Woo film, or The Night Comes For Us, or Ong-Bak, or Born To Fight, or Eastern Condors or In The Line of Duty IV or.... well, you get the idea).", "rating": 4, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 146, "votes": 229}, "heading": "It got on my wick.", "date": "2023-03-25T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8950606"}, {"content": "I have to say that the only John Wick film that I've really liked before this one is the original.

Now the film is 169 minutes long. However I didn't feel the 3 hours and instead it felt like 1 hour and 40 minutes which is a magical feet of editing and pacing.The films side charachters have their own storylin eand events. The most memorable is caine played by donnie yen a blind assassin and a old friend of John whose sent by Bill Skargards marquee the highest ranked of the high table to kill john wick and seeing how john has nothing to lose you actually feel sorry for caine as its clear he doesn't want to do what he's been tasked with doing but is aware of what happens if rules are broken and it makes him a very interesting charachter that I would love to have a spin off film with. Other memorable side characters are mr nobody or tracker as he's listed here on imdb (shaming anderson) is a low class assassin whose after john however is on and off between going ahead with what he's set out to do for personal reasons and then we have shimazy (hiroyuki sanada) whose a owner of a continental in Japan and gets a set piece to shine as well as his daughter AKira (Rina sawayama) who blames john for breaking the rules and fears for her fathers safety.The bowery king (Lawrence fishbourne), winston (Ian mc shane) and charon (lance reddick r.i.p) are all here and have their own reasons for helping john tldr every charachter here is excellent and brought to life in such a way that you forget that they're not real people and just actors playing them this also goes for keanu reeves as john wick he's brilliant here and we all know that he does his own stunts which is really the draw for these movies but this one is amazing in all departments. He'll even the soundtrack is amazing here tyler bates and Joel j Richards score is present in the film and benefits the action on screen and over all film.The film also gives john a satisfying resolution to his story over the 4 movies.The only other action movies I'd put above this is die hard and terminator 2 judgement day to even be compared to those movies should scream see this movie if it doesint I don't know what will.See this in cinemas ideally a imax cinema and don't wait till its on a streaming service this was made to be seen on the biggest screen possible.So overall, It's a 10/10 movie that you should absolutely see in cinemas if at all possible you won't regret it and is by far the best action film since the matrix in 1999.

That was my JW, the Baba Yaga. A legend brought back to life because someone stole his car and took his dog. Perfection.Fast forward till now and over hours of my life, JW has eroded into some kind of cartoon. The man should be in a full body cast at all times but no, he just bounces around like a rubber ball, seemingly mad at himself at certain points because he keeps getting back up. The premise of JW is that he's an extraordinarily TALENTED man - not Wolverine - yet he is now a superhero. And much of this movie didn't make sense - why wasn't his rage directed at Winston?!? He was the one who betrayed him in the 3rd movie. His reasons for all his actions aren't compelling at all any more....in reality, if he's THIS MAD he should be going after the cancer research centers that didn't save his wife.If all that you ever loved about JW is the shooting, well, this will be your jam.

A movie still grounded in reality where the protagonist gets knocked out by a baseball bat to the head and when he finds his car stolen and dog killed, he is out for justice.He seems smart, capable, still a bit vulnerable and you feel the stakes he is fighting for and it's a bit like Taken on some strong Steroids.----------------------------This movie is nothing like that, besides al the awesome action (since awesome action it absolutely is). We are now in the MCU!In this movie John Wick falls 222 stairs down and 30 seconds later he is up and running. He's being thrown 10 meters down and also here after 30 seconds he is up and running again. Even Deadpool might be thinking twice before he meets John Wick!He also has to battle Dare Devil, but who decides to battle with swords and guns, but for some reason is not called Dare Devil. He knows exactly where the enemies are and what they are doing when the plots needs him to at other times he has to put in a bit more effort.Also interesting how John Wick wastes a lot of bullets on 3 guys on horses in the desert running in a straight like, while in Paris he precisely headshots people in the middle of the air who are doing saltos after hit by cars. John Wick loves to play with your expectations in how capable you think him to be. One moment he kills 50 people in a minute, the next he has a hard time fighting the gold tooth german King Pin, even though he already hurt him in many ways(even shooting him up the @$$).Also fun to see Morphius again, starting with a grandiose opening, firing things up (for no reason) and we expect a lot from him, since he wanted revenge of how he lost it all. To only show up close to the ending.Also the psychotic party goers in Heaven and Hell in Germany is interesting to see. You see them sometimes looking at all the people being killed around them by guns, swords and axes that are flying around, to then just continue dancing again. Only after the boss has been killed, everyone is suddenly aware that they need to get out of there.So if you just turn of your brain and look at the spectacle, you are in for a treat.

We dive further into the lore of the High Table, the intriguing universe set in motion from the first film gets expanded with new (and significant) characters being introduced, but most importantly, the set-pieces outshine all else. We came for the action, we stayed for THE ACTION (of course!) and the collective brilliance that film offers. And by collective brilliance, I'm referring to the stylistic choices employed in each set-piece, right from a Lawrence of Arabia-like scene in the desert to an incredible showdown at a German nightclub, and the unforgettable stretch of relentless action in that Parisian final act.Chad Stahelski excels in the staging aspect. He is currently at the top of the Hollywood-actioner food chain, and rightly so. The camerawork (by Dan Laustsen, who also shot the second and third outings) is fluid when it's capturing the set-pieces while also treating us to some breathtaking imagery, be it in New York, Osaka, Berlin, or Paris. The aerial frames are straight out of an RPG game, and that particular scene featuring the TTI Dracarys Gen-12 shotgun, looks insane, to say the least. I'd also give credit to the entire stunt department for pulling off that staircase sequence in Paris (good lord!). Also, seeing John Wick simultaneously wield a Nunchaku and a Glock was perfection!Donnie Yen is such a kickass addition to this microcosm, both in terms of delivering high-octane action and playing a character that suits him to the T. Hiroyuki Sanada and Rina Sawayama get to be part of an exciting showdown in Japan, with the latter holding immense potential for the franchise's future. Ian McShane and Lawrence Fishburne pop up during those moments the film needs them the most, offering us smiles and hoots. Shamier Anderson and his \"faithful accomplice\" (a Belgian Malinois, played by five different dogs) are splendid. Also, RIP Lance Reddick (you will be missed!).Scott Adkins, as the quirky-yet-menacing Killa, rises to the occasion as a secondary antagonist, with him beating the crap out of Wick in a stunningly stylized set-piece. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, playing the arrogant (primary) antagonist, is the ideal final boss. The hybrid score by Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard fulfills the task of elevating the fast-paced action, resulting in frequent adrenaline rushes. The ending came off as a bit of a surprise, given there was early news about a Chapter 5. But the post-credit scene leaves enough room for one specific story to continue. Even at 2h 49m, Chapter 4 is fully engaging, leaving no stone unturned from an action-fanatic's perspective.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 6}, "heading": "Truly a sight to behold on the big screen!

But to have them in a John Wick film isn't just a dream come true, it's a work of sheer genius. I've had my expectations high for several films this year, such as Pants Man, Cocaine Bore, and Scream VI, which have all let me down.So I tried to lower my expectations for this, but I couldn't. Because this franchise has just been getter bigger and better with each instalment. And does it meet expectations?Too bloody right it does, it's a masterpiece in set pieces and going above and beyond in pleasing the fans.There are five huge set pieces that are wonderfully staged, and they are brutal and unflinching, and usurp anything from the previous three movies.The first is at Shimazus Continental, and although it goes on for a while, it's breathtaking, reminiscent of the shootout at the end of Parrabellum, but with Yen making good use of an everyday household item, and the icing on the cake for this sequence, Wick using nunchucks. That's all you need to know. Wick using nunchucks.The second features again, Yen, but now we have Scott Adkins thrown in. And for good measure, he's wearing a fat suit. Again, beautifully staged, with Wick suffering badly this time at the hands of Adkins, with a beautiful diegetic piece from Le Castlevania, keeping the tradition of the franchise. If you though a pencil was a good weapon, wait until you see what is used here.Thirdly, and arguably the best, we have a shoot out around the Arc De Triumphe. A ballet of cars and bullets that had me on the edge of my seat. It's so seamless and expertly made, I doubt you'll find a better cinematic action scene this decade. It's that beautiful.Fourthly, we have a wonderful over head long take with Wick taking out bad guys from room to room, using the most unique gun of the series. It's literally a blast.And the most bone crunching and funniest sequence is on the steps leading to the church. It puts The Exorcist to shame.All this clocking in at nearly three hours, and I didn't once find the film bloated or lagging. As for Reeves, he's a movie star. Some of his acting is pretty questionable in the film, but the man has screen presence, and by his performance, he's dedicated to the cause of Wick.What let the side down a little was Skarssgards pantomime portrayal of the villain. He's far too camp to be in the least but threatening, and the 'help' Wick received from the tracker was a little too convenient at times.But minor quibble aside, this is a masterpiece of action, it's balls to the wall from the moment you see the Thunder Road PC logo, right until the fade of the last scene.This is everything you've expected and more.

Maybe the worst. Painfully unrealistic, everyone wears literally bulletproof smokings and the elite guys were recruited out of gardeners, tax attorneys and university professors judging by their skill to kill with weapons. When in the first movie John shot each enemy a bullet in the head he now often feels the need to use 3 bullets (but sometimes they still stand).As much as I enjoyed the very first John Wick movie as bored I felt during these extremely long and uninteresting fighting scenes. He is as immortal as Iron Man and with this leaves all excitement.And it seems as if the directors were mocking the franchise by letting John fall out of the 4th floor, getting run over by cars, falling down literally 222 steps (I know because they mention it) of a staircase and all of it just leads to some short heavy breathing but it's forgotten just 3 seconds later.None of the characters have personality. Keanus text was probably printed on half a page and mostly consists of 2 syllabus-responses or the name of the person he's just looking at.I really like and appreciate Keanu as a person and actor. I just wish the director would have taken this movie serious. I wouldn't want to rewatch even 10 minutes of this letdown of a movie.

The film's runtime is nearly three hours, and it does not disappoint when it comes to action. The movie commences with John Wick embarking on a battle against a group of assassins pursuing him. John Wick's combat skills are honed, and he quickly dispatches his opponents. The High Table, a group of powerful individuals, appears, and their leader declares that John must die. Caine, a former colleague of John's, is recruited to assist in John's assassination. John must use all his abilities to stay alive, but the odds are against him.The action scenes in the film are spectacular, with some of the most excellent stunt work seen in a long time.

Paris scene was a bit chaotic, to me it felt a bit too blatant. It's supposed to be a secret society. In previous titles when Wick fights off killers it's been mostly discrete, or at least they try if I remember correctly. NOT IN PARIS. Swarm of killers just hunt Wick openly, might as well do it in broad daylight. Kinda break immersion if you ask me. Also, I'm not sure what's the purpose of the existence of Mr. Nobody, it's an interesting character for sure but felt a bit out of place. The writings failed to incorporate him and elevate him to plot significance. The movie would work with or without him, such a pity because I really like the character, he has a lot of potential to be greater. Last but not least, the main antagonist is just some typical spoiled brat, don't get me wrong the acting was on point, but the character himself is kinda boyish and weak, not a charismatic and strong antagonist I hoped for.

The action/fight sequences are done in long takes, gleefully violent, gracefully over the top, relentless pandemonium, and a complete assault on all the senses. It's pure, unadulterated mayhem and fun.The cinematography is gorgeous to look at with awesome shots thrown in. Biggest complaint is the movie is a little too long; almost three hours. But that goes by quite quickly even though it just drags in a couple of scenes. The fight choreography is something Jackie Chan would be very of to make. Keanu Reeves does a great job with his fight scenes and he is pushing fifty but acts like he is in his twenties. Bill Skarsgard (Pennywise from \"It\") pulls off a sadistic villain mixed in with great performances from Donnie Yen (his character is blind but still kicks ass) and Shamier Anderson with his beloved mutt.It's not quite a masterpiece; but delivers a pure, adrenaline filled cinematic experience.

Bill plays the Marquis, a sort of big shot in the High Table organization that wants Keanu dead. Donnie plays an old friend of Keanu's that Bill forces to hunt Keanu. Shamier is another hired gun that Bill gets to join in on the hunt. Shamier is called the Tracker and has a highly trained dog that tag teams Shamier in fights-on voice commands. All Keanu wants is to get his freedom back and his name cleared. He learns of a loop hole in the High Table rules and focuses all his abilities on reaching that agenda.

I was shocked at how much fun I had with that film though and have enjoyed Chapters two and three almost just as much. The action has always been the reason to see these films and Keanu Reeves just being Keanu Reeves? C'mon, it doesn't get much more enjoyable than that. Well, John Wick: Chapter 4 has just hit theatres and it's not just my favourite John Wick film, it's one of my favourite straight-up mainstream action films in years. Here's why, especially if you've enjoyed the previous three, this one is a must-see.Picking up relatively soon after the events of John Wick: Chapter 3, we see John Wick has pretty much recovered after an impossible feat at the end of that third film. He learns how to get to the High Table and also how he can be freed of being a wanted and hunted man, but new foes and many new armies will stop at nothing to take him down before he accomplishes that task. That's pretty much it for the plot, even though much more happens throughout the film that I will not spoil here. Without wasting any time though, I have to say that this film pulls no punches in its action or story for that matter. This is easily the most intricate story and the greatest action this franchise has given us yet.At a run time that closes in on three hours, I never felt it. Every 20-30 minutes this film dives into action sequences that last a good 20 minutes each. On top of that, I have to commend the cinematography by Dan Laustsen, because this is some of the best-filmed action scenes I've seen in years. Yes, there are times when it starts to feel excessive, but that's usually right about the time that those sequences are concluding. The action never felt like it overstayed its welcome this time around. The action feels like a lot, but it also feels more sparse due to the long run time.In the end, John Wick: Chapter 4 does a great job furthering this story, expanding on the mythology, and giving us somewhat of a conclusion to this franchise. I'm not sure where a fifth film could go from here. I've enjoyed the overdone performance by Keanu Reeves throughout the entire franchise and that is only accentuated here. Yes, as most of these films go, I've had issues with the screenplay in terms of the simplistic dialogue, but I honestly feel that it's just intentional at this point and therefore it made me enjoy this one even more. If a silly, well-crafted action flick can be a near-masterpiece, I'll say this comes close, but with a few minor issues.

I'm writing this review in the early hours after midnight as the film went on for a good whopping 2 hours & 39 minutes!! But we'll get to that in a bit...! Anyway, I was looking forward to this film since John Wick 3's release back in 2019 & this film has had a bit of a troubled history of getting pushed back until it finally got its March 2023 release. I must admit I was a bit skeptical, but, was looking forward to this as the John Wick films are ace, but this film was a bitter disappointment...!The film sees John Wick, who from the events of the last film, has a price on his head which is increasing more than ever. The lethal unstoppable force of nature assassin now must fight against the High Table Global as he seeks out & fights the most deadly assassins players of the underworld from Paris to New York to Berlin to Japan. Will John Wick finally meet his match!?Whoa...! Where do I start!? I found the film for starters to be too long!! At a whopping 2 hours & 39 minutes this film is way, way, way too long! The pacing... whoa! Don't get me started! I was willing to be tolerant & forgive the pacing, but when it got to the final leg it took the absolute puss & started to test my nerves! The story is so weak I had to look this film up in order to get what the plot was, again, another sign that the film was going to be bad, the first was the runtime, which I knew was going to be bad from the word go!The film took a while to get going which was a pain, but it got there I guess! The fights were good, as with the John Wick films typically are, not to mention funny & brutal! But all things considered, it got repetitive fast & annoying especially near the end as I just mentioned! The story scenes were alright as with the villains & bad guys though again, it got repetitive & irritating.The realism was stretch beyond its limits here in this film. John Wick fell from a great height on a metal pipe which looked to have (& lets be honest here) would've snapped his back like a tooth pick! John got hit by a car 5 times yet never suffers any bad injuries or dies! Yet a few bullet wounds finally kill him at the end (another downer of this film which I'll touch up on in a second!), the fight scenes in the night club where only a few people stood there shocked while about 95% just kept on dancing! Face palm! There were several other scenes which made you just think \"dafuq!?\"The lead up to the end was annoying! Just when you thought John Wick was going to go to the Stand Off with the blind villain, there was more fight scenes! Don't get me wrong, these fights where good, but annoying & held the film up for a good 20 minutes before the finale which to say the least, was anti climatic! The scene on the 122 steps was irritating & made you just scoffs in frustration when John got kicked down those steps which for a couple of seconds in its self, dragged & felt & looked comical! It's like getting so far in a mission in Grand Theft Auto V then dying & reverting back to the latest checkpoint where you have to start all, over, again!! The same feelings of that (from experience) where felt for me in this film from that scene!Then of course, after John Wick killing 180 odd people (or more, I lost count obviously) he finally dies! What!? Like James Bond in that god awful Bond Film of 2021 No Time To Die!? Can't be!? What a poor show! Anyhow, to give you guys some perspective on how long this is in comparison to the rest of the films in the franchise! Without credits as they don't count!John Wick (2015) - 1 hour 30 minutes\nJohn Wick 2 (2017) - 1 hour 50 minutes\nJohn Wick 3 (2019) - 1 hours 57 minutes\nJohn Wick 4 (2023) - 2 hours 39 minutesNotice how the films got long & long with each entry...!Overall, this ranks as they absolute worst of the franchise! I was willing to forgive the poor pacing & overly bloated runtime, but it got on my nerves too much to bare & when I saw that John Wick died!? Nope, that was it for me! The editing was poor with this film whoever edited this needs class in editing as this was bad beyond belief! The pacing also was poor combined with the bad editing! The fights were good, but too drawn out, long & annoyingly repetitive! The ending was both bad & anti climatic! How this film has 95% on RT is beyond me! But then what do I expect...! This ranks as the worst John Wick film in the franchise! With word of a female spin-off coming out (which will be bad), I've lost hope in this franchise!

He has had a build up for a while and has now transformed into Johns suit and gun supplier? More wasted potential.The world building/lore is still very weak- there is so much interesting potential here instead we are just given one liners and are expected to eat it up.

Director Chad Stahelski has done the unthinkable; he has outdone himself in this fourth entry by taking a two hour and forty-nine-minute runtime (the longest in the series) and making it feel an hour shorter. This is a combat magnum opus, a relentless sensory experience, gorgeously hyperviolent, and easily the best in the series.Baba Yaga is, once again, fighting to defeat the High Table while also facing a devilish and powerful new adversary (a disquieting and deviously memorable performance by Bill Skarsg\u00e4rd as Marquis) in death-defying, blood-spurting, neon-blasting, stunts-to-spare, well-groomed, high-fashion style. Yes, the plot is rather simple, straightforward, and lacking in in-depth character background, but that hasn't been the strength of any of the Wick films anyway.The masterful elements at play in \"Chapter 4\" begin with its colorful, even extravagant, and likeable supporting characters including Laurence Fishburne as the crafty Bowery, Clancy Brown as the cryptic Harbinger, Donnie Yen - electrifying as the blind, yet intuitive Caine - and most terrifically, Shamier Anderson as Tracker - a shady spy-like character that gives an indelible performance that ranges from brutal toughness to vulnerable subjugation.Add heart-pounding sound effects and a pulsating musical score, striking nighttime, dark and gritty noir-inspired cinematography, and masterful fighting choreography that frames Wick in different cities with sumptuous vistas across the globe (the locales are outstanding from Sacr\u00e9 Coeur, to Arc de Triomphe, to the Louvre, to the Eiffel Tower in France to the opening scene in Aqaba, Jordan plus Berlin and Tokyo) and you end up with what feels like the most edgy, revolutionary, and most James Bond-esque entry yet.The elaborate and visceral set designs are \"Chapter 4's\" crowning achievement; lavish and rich with detail, they put Wick in elegant and high-tech rooms, ornate buildings, rousing nightclubs, and most memorably, a long flight of stairs and heavily trafficked streets where gut-wrenching, head-popping fighting sequences ensue. It's a WICKedly wild ride from beginning to end that left me breathless, gasping, and exclaiming \"wow!\" in wonderment.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 75, "votes": 109}, "heading": "One of the most beautiful and hyperkinetic action films ever!", "date": "2023-03-24T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8948630"}, {"content": "Not just best John Wick movie but also the best action movie I've seen in a long time.

Not quite as dynamic, but captures his dad's intensity as the big baddy who causes a lot of trouble with ruthless efficiency.Donnie Yen is awesome in the action roles, and he has an incredible prowess in choreography and delivery to make him a stand up character in this universe, like Rogue One on adult steroids.Shamier Anderson is good for the times he's in, and that's all I can say to not give too much away. Quite, calculating, but gifted in the edge of this action series, he belongs well in this chapter and universe for many things.-Fisburne is fine for when he is on stage, he just needed more time, involvement and dare I say development that Chapter 3 and the commercial s promised.-As for Reeves, the man may not be the best actor, but he is awesome in terms of stunts, very blunt edges, comedic delivery (intentional and unintentional), and just that feeling by saying little. He struggles with, well some other things, but somehow it works given his character.The Story Building\n-I've said it several times, but yeah, there is a bit more of the story in this one and much more character development than the past.-Wick's fourth chapter really starts to expand upon Wick's background, while opening up the facets of new characters and trying to help build more of the past.-It's endearing, it's deeper, and establishes layers to characters for books, and other media can expand upon if the movies ever dry up or won't go down the prequel path.-And this particular chapter has enough of the now moments to help things really engage and be intense to help Wick's story continue to expand into levels that just make you continue to root for this character.-Which leads to the next like.The Emotions Surprisingly\n-This movie is emotional because it really pushes into those little divots from the past and extends them to more engaging character moments.-Chapter 4 uses the music, the footage, and the story to great levels and establishes moments that help ground the action and silence the action edge.-And it's extraordinarily balanced to the point that it only adds not takes away from the story, and gives stakes and care to the action sequences they designed.-Having such investments into this movie helps get past the usual stereotype of mindless action without much else, and if you are hooked to Keanu's character, you are in luck with this installment really polishing him up.The Special Effects\n-You have to make this movie shine to capture the action and make it really shine in this world that makes \"action\" movies.-It works. Wick's scenes have the sound to capture and bring you into the mix. Bullets bouncing, clips discharging, swords clanging and explosions rattling with the music.-But the audio only goes so far if you don't have the visuals, and Wick's team has you covered there with tricks and trades that make the insanity come to life.-Amidst impressive sets, Wick has stellar visual effects as the extras go flying from the stunts as computer and reality combines to make believable bouts of death on the screen.-Flashes of guns, people falling back, blood, and reactions all work together and really make things that insane bout of action that I expected and love in this series.-And it's all captured with camera work and editing that doesn't get lost to shaky work, or that realistic found footage twist that annoys me with some action films. That works super well with me.The Action Sequences\n-The heart of this movie, Wick is all about the action. Clocking in at roughly 88% of the movie by my calculations, Wick's longest film adds A LOT MORE action than I anticipated.-Simplistic at first, the movie evolves to add story elements to each fight, while also adding different styles to help diversify the profile , which I greatly appreciated.-Sword fights with physical moves and gunplay opens up at one point, and then we switch to different combats the next as the five sequences help add new styles to freshen things up.-And again it works with the emotion and the story to help add that stakes I like, alongside some of the justice filled finishes you love so much.Dislikes:Too late for this level of Storytelling\n-Was the storytelling too late? In a sense for me, yes. Wick may not be known for the plot, but to take such strides and character development this late in the game might have been weaker to me.-These new relationships seem random. The history lost to the fast pace and stunts, that they don't have the full time to commit for me to be worth it.-Throw in the ploy to potentially capitalize on it further and well... it's not the worst, but it just didn't have the full meat I think they could have done.Some Plots Rushed\n-The fast pace means the attempts to build plots is also very quick, this film trying to tie many elements from 1-3 into one film, which means lots of details to revisit.-Nostalgia wise, it worked for me, but these moments were very quick, and limber, again leading to a weaker story in my opinion.-For an action flick it's good, but for the legacy of Wick, it could have been better, and perhaps this is going to be a lead in to some spin off given the trend of Hollywood and streaming.Loud In My Showing\n-I may sound old, but if you have sensitive ears, caution for the movie is very loud to the point it can be very distracting.-If you too are sensitive, just exercise caution so you don't injure anything.Still Some Level of Absurdity\n-I know Wick is already extreme and absurd at times, but I'm always looking to see where they go too far.-And this movie has a few moments that are a bit hard to swallow and ignore at the cheese factor that they take to make their fantasy come to life.-One thing is the costumes they adorn and how selective their immunity is, there is a little more explanation, but it's quite amazing to see the double standards.-Other times it's about the invincibility factor that Wick seems to have, alongside the recovery part that gets stretched a little too much for my tastes. It might be part of the magic, but, the absurdity still is going a tad too far since the first movie.The Final Sequence Makes the Movie A Tad Long\n-I'm one for action, but in this case, the final fight sort of extends the feature a bit longer than I personally enjoy given how absurd the final moment is.-A climb so to speak goes a tad longer, and though the moves are awesome, the comedy great and the tying of things together works... it does not offset that it wasn't needed given what was coming.-Chapter 4's length is going to be a solid hook for the die-hard fanbase, but for others like me, that final fight just goes a tad too long given there is still another action moment to come.The After Credit Scenes\n-The fact there is one has me shake my head, but that aside, this chapter serves as something to try to tie up a loose story end they forgot, or maybe set the stage for what is next.-All I can say is that a long list of names to get there was mediocre in terms of what could be set up when it comes the world the High-Table focuses on. But was it needed? My opinion... no, not at all.The VERDICT:\nJohn's fourth adventure was shaping to be one of the best action movies for me in a long time, and perhaps one of the best in this series. It's got heart, emotion, and depth I did not expect as the worlds collided and it balanced a lot of things to integrate into the action moments. The movie is visually impressive, a stunning collaboration of sound and video that combined with the planning, just gives this elite fighting movie moxie to make you squirm in your seat. And with all the dark antics and violence, this genre really does have a pinnacle sequel on hand to give the fans more of what they want, but actually push the envelope with it. And yet.. the movie still has things that are needing fine tuning to push to the pinnacle of movies. Absurdity is one thing, but pacing still has some things to work on to help give the movie the bite it wants, alongside the fact of trying to do a pinch more of character balancing that they seem to struggle. Nevertheless, this movie is definitely the leading film of the month right now, and has many things to drag you to the theater to see it.

The best Chapter yet...John Wick: Chapter 4 feels like a film where Director Chad Stahelski understood that he finally had the freedom and the budget to do, literally, anything he wanted on the screen-and might never again-so by God, he was going to do it.With characters able to dodge bullets left, right and centre, the film is a homage to the classic martial-arts genre with a sprinkling of old Hollywood Westerns where protagonists never seem to run out of ammunition or ways to stay alive.The movie also deepens its mythology, exploring more aspects of The High Table's history and hierarchy. We learn more about John Wick's past and his connection to other characters in this world. We also meet new faces that add more flavor and diversity to the franchise. Donnie Yen plays Caine, a fellow assassin who shares a bond with John Wick. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd plays Marquis, a mysterious figure who has ties to The High Table. Hiroyuki Sanada plays Shimazu, a ruthless leader of a Japanese crime syndicate.Donnie Yen brings not only his skills as one of the finest martial arts movie stars in the world, but lends his presence as a charismatic and riveting figure. He plays the role of Caine with complexity and humanity that is a terrific mirror to Reeves' Wick; his friend and adversary by circumstance. This was a fantastic choice to take the Wick series to a new level.Overall, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a satisfying conclusion (or is it?) to one of the best action franchises of recent years.

Having all the opportunities to collect the bounty was just too easy and took away from all other more deserving assassins to collect, and more importantly, his reasons for not cashing in were just too unbelievable and ridiculous.

If it werent for the much TOO long duration I would rate this nr 4 sequel better / higher as the nr 3 edition.Nothing beats the original first edition of John Wick though, because THAT first edition was not only contineous action but also cared about the CHARACTERS. Unfortunately all the sequels were more and more focussed on solely the figthing scenes, which kinda bored me in the end.Nr 4 is highly overrated. I suspect because of artificial \"managing\" of the Imdb ratings. This movie is never worthy of 8 stars (ridiculous). 6 stars at best. But because I got bored at the end I will only rate it 5 stars...", "rating": 5, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 68, "votes": 132}, "heading": "I feared the worst, but it was better than I expected, although not near as good as the original.", "date": "2023-03-24T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8948328"}, {"content": "It's stylish, very stylish.

But if martial arts are your thing, you're in for a visual treat.For what it's worth, I personally found the Osaka scene just a little bit too long. The Berlin one was superb and the some of the action in Paris was quite remarkable - notably the scene shot from above which was really excellent. Also the irony that the Parisien drivers on the Arc de Triomphe were far more lethal than 25 men with guns made me laugh!

Hence the efficiency and necessity of one or two shots to the cranium. And very little blood, which I don't miss at all, given that, like sex, I don't need more than a glance to get it.As with most cinema, even impossibly successful runs like this thriller juggernaut, it's about storytelling even when it's about beautifully-choreographed fight sequences that mix martial arts with high-end weaponry that includes a \"dragon's breath shotgun\"! The story is as old as movies themselves: global corporate hoodlums, The Table, are after assassin John Wick, a wicked former employee. The rep is the smarmy Marguis (Bill Skarsgard), decked out in three-piece suits, the brighter the better, and cravats louder than Winston's (thank you costume designer Paco Delgado).Wait till you see the wild-ass fight on a lengthy set of Parisian stairs or sit across from Killa (Scott Adkins, a martial arts expert), an almost sumo-sized card dealer. His silver teeth take us back to a memorable menace in the James Bond canon.It's all very stylish, no doubt because of returning director Chad Stahelski's penchant for colorful neo-noir and writers Shay Hatten and Michael Finch's ability to take the fantasy into new/old motifs such as a duel that Clint Eastwood would approve. They also supply lines like \"Second chances are the refuge of men who fail\" in a film where memorable dialogue is not what the audience expected.Who would expect set pieces such as combat in the Louvre and around the Arc de Triumph? Or better, who has a budget to afford those glories? Well, the producer of one of the most lucrative crime thriller series in cinema history that takes us to Germany, Japan, and France with ease.I can't predict if Keanu Reeves will return, he with a fortune now probably greater than Croesus' (I hear Reeves is generous with his wealth), because one of the great lines from John's Japanese friend, Shimazu ( Hiroyuki Sanada), in this murderous ballet is \"Have you given any thought to how this ends?\"I have, and I hope it returns if it has more of the absurd style and beautiful ballet peppered with dialogue as sharp as the swords that dispatch very sharp baddies.

It was good, then it was bad, then it was great, then boring, then absolutely amazing, then disappointing. If we are speaking solely about the Action, this was the greatest Action movie of all time. Every fight was legendary and the new tricks and weapons they used were unlike anything I've ever seen before. The exploding shotgun, the ultra-realistic fighting choreography, and the entire world getting bossed up by Mr. Wick. If the movie were just all of the fight scenes mashed together, this may have been a perfect movie. However, unfortunately, as movies tend to go, there also happens to be a story element to them. And for John Wick 4, it was atrocious and easily the worst story in the franchise.Anytime the new villain was on screen it was a complete snooze fest, apart from the end where he gets a bullet in the head. Some of those scenes went on way too long and made some of the Action scenes less impactful because of what we had to go through to get there. I was excited when I saw the 2hr and 49 minute runtime, as I loved the first 3 John Wicks, but this movie had no business being that long. So much of it should've been cut out. There was way too much plot armor given to the head of security for the High Table and the guy he meets the card table, which made it felt forced at times. I have no problem with all the plot armor given to John Wick, but I was not a fan of those other characters being portrayed in that way.Now for the 2 most problematic parts of the movie. For one, can they make up their mind when it comes to the relationship between John and Caine and the Tracker? They're fighting against each other and then working together and then fighting against each other and then working together and then half fighting against each other and half working together. It felt sloppy and inconsistent in a way that was not productive. Lastly, HE DIES? You have got to be kidding me. It's not just the fact that he dies, but it's the way it happens. Granted, there is probably a 99% chance he's still alive, but absolutely nothing in his final conversation with Caine and Winston made me thinking he was dying. And now he just collapses over on the stairs and it cuts to his tombstone? For everything he was able to endure throughout the 4 films, it was a pretty pathetic way to end the movie and it felt like a slap in the face. John Wick deserved way better. We also still got virtually nothing about his wife apart from a single flashback, an element that should've been explored by now.This movie review is long because I'm very passionate about John Wick and I love his character and the movies that came before this one. To end on a positive note, there were still a bunch of good things that happened in this film that were just unfortunately watered down by the length of the film and the rest of the story. The humor was phenomenal, both Caine and the Tracker's character were great additions, and there were a lot of high impact scenes, such as John saving the Tracker's dog. Lastly, RIP to the legend Lance Reddick. I know he didn't have a major part in this movie, but he has given a memorable performance in each of the prior movies and was so talented.

Wow. Just wow. I was in complete awe. There were multiple times I was both tearing up and laughing at how unbelievably amazing the fight scenes are. Now this is nothing new for the John Wick series. But for me, this is far and away the best action of the entire series.I'm an action junkie and am repeatedly disappointed with action movies and their terrible fight scenes, filled with shaky cam, quick cuts and close-up shots (looking at you Snake Eyes and Mortal Kombat). Then I watch a John Wick movie and feel so spoiled, while also being baffled at why other action movies can't learn from this. The fights are so fast-paced yet completely clear and easy to follow.There is every kind of fighting imaginable. So many weapons, styles, chases, vehicles, animals, everything. So much creativity with the kills. Amazing combinations of weaponry and fighting styles (pistol/sword combo is my fave).The music is awesome as usual, maybe even a step up. It enhances every action scene. The cinematography is pristine. So many beautiful shots, so many mesmerizing locations for the action. It is stylistically beautiful.There are a couple of scenes that are shot in such a creative way that I've never seen before. One is an overhead shot one-take that I couldn't believe. It takes the movie to a new level. So many scenes feel like they're a video game brought to life. Numerous times it feels like the VR game Pistol Whip.Donnie Yen is awesome. End of paragraph.About an hour into this nearly 3-hour movie, I felt like I experienced enough action amazingness for an entire movie. I was in a state of ecstasy. Not only was this looking like the best of the series, I started wondering if this would be a landmark action flick. Maybe it's my own fault for setting expectations so high mid-movie, but the second half is more flawed, though still awesome.The subplot with the tracker doesn't seem at all consequential. And his dog attacks were already done, and better, with Halle Berry in Parabellum. A few of the issues I had with Parabellum pop up again, like overdoing it sometimes with the damage he takes. For example, instead of getting hit by one car, he gets hit by three cars. And that's a mild example. Also, it's fairly anticlimactic.Even with those flaws, I had a BLAST with this movie and will definitely see it at least once more in theaters. Seeing it on a premium screen is a must. Loudest speakers, biggest screen. TRUST ME.EDIT: I was itching to go again since opening night. I wasn't able to wait more than 5 days. On second viewing, I still felt the same flaws, but I didn't care. The action is incredible. It has at least four* of my all-time favorite action scenes. I want to watch these scenes a hundred times.It's definitely not perfect, but I still consider it an action landmark (last time I said that was Mad Max: Fury Road).

In fact John was barely in the first half hour of the movie which I was surprised by but it was a very welcome change of pace.The action sequences are bigger and better than we have ever seen before, they've always managed to top themselves movie to movie and Chapter 4 is no different.But the absolute standout action sequence for me is in this abandoned French home in the third act of the film. It was fantastically choreographed, and the camera work was phenomenal and truly unique. Whatever the camera crew is making its not enough.Some certain issues for me, where as I didn't feel the run time for the most part I did begin to feel fatigue during an action sequence in the third act. It felt prolonged to me and I just wanted to move forward with things. But the movie never felt to have dragged and was entertaining and engaging through its entire run time.Lastly I would like to say some words about the recently passed Lance Riddick. While his character Charon was small, his impact was anything but small. The John Wick world, and The Continental Hotel will not be the same without it's courteous and always professional concierge, he will be missed! As Winston said...\"He was a friend\"If this is the final Chapter in the John Wick storyline then I am very pleased with its conclusion but as I mentioned there's plenty of opportunity for more in this world.IMDb: 9/10\nLetterboxd: 4/5Watched in Theaters.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 13, "votes": 22}, "heading": "\"Winston... will you take me home?\"", "date": "2023-03-24T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8947726"}, {"content": "John Wick Chapter 4 is a love letter to action film-making and every action cinema lovers wet dream. The cinematography is oscar worthy, the neo-noir genre has never looked better on the big screen as the bold and vibrant colours makes each scene of this film a bold underlined statement that what you are experiencing is something special.The action choreography utilizies 100% of each and every set design used in the film to incorporate drama, thrill and also comedy. This movie has everything you could ever ask for - guns, knifes, nunchucks, katanas, martial arts, cars, flamethrowers, bare hands etc. The stuntwork is jaw-dropping and adrenaline inducing, specially a stunt that was performed on a staircase on the later half of the film, left me wondering how did the stunt coordinator get that Tom Cruise-level life threatening stunt greenlit.But what truly makes this story special are the characters and the drama surrounding them as they manoeuvre their way through this twisted world of crime where each person is their only friend. There are a lot of new characters introduced and none of them feel throwaway as each and everyone of them bring something new and exciting to the table and moves the narrative forward. And the centre of this narrative, Keanu Reeves who plays John Wick, a loving husband proves once again why his contribution to this role will be remembered forever as something that revolutionalized action film-making.This was the one of the most satisfying experience I ever had inside a movie theatre and it leaves you with the question that how many times are you going to return to experience this once in a lifetime masterclass in action film-making.10/10 - John wick Chapter 4 is a a modern day classic.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 5, "votes": 9}, "heading": "A thrill ride of a lifetime", "date": "2023-03-24T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8947696"}, {"content": "This chapter of JW was really amazing; action-packed, compelling, funny and star-filled.

We are supposed to have some fantasy level of skills here, but just some level, a believable level, this went way beyond even strongest superheroes strength level at some points and i am not kidding! Its ridiculous!!!Main villain is nonsense, its just so illogical in this universe.

Crazy!!!Ending is rushed as many parts of the movie, and feels utterly disappointing and unsatisfying, only good thing to some degree is scenes with Scott \"unrecognizable\" Adkins.Keanu seems were off for the whole movie, like he has no energy, and he does more than superheroes do in this one, its just cringe after cringe after cringe.

John sets out to prepare for his war against the High Table, and be free from all this once and for all.

John wicks' chapter 4 is nothing short of an epic action if the term can apply to action films. Its film it's ushering a fresh light on the genre from its stunts to the fight choreography and high tension. Which continues throughout these movies including this one. The chapter is by all means the best out of the four films since the first. It sets up the situation and throws you off on this thriller of a ride. With the 4th film, not much can be said that hasn't been said about the previous installments. Action is amazing fast paced, and excellent stunt work. Great performance from the cast Keanu Reeves you know him you love as John, Ian McShane, and The late Lance Reddicks. The new cast while Parabellum did a good job of setting up the grand finale. It didn't have the most interesting dialogue. The Adjudicator this woman was not at all interesting and took away a lot of the awe and charm of the mystery of the Table. Here was given Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd as The Marquee. He carries more than a traditional shadow figurine showing that this is a guy who has a lot of power calm and is calculated but won't lift a finger and do his dirty work. He's a face you can love to hate So are the side characters Donnie Yen is arguably the best character in the film as he plays a blind swordsman named Cain. He has his reason for wanting john dead, but in many, he's conflicted on the matter. Some of the more somber moments of the film between him and John are compelling. And of course, he's a badass. Fast and on his feet, kind of out stages John in some scenes. They do a very great job and creative ways of showing how he fights.s There's also another guy after John simply called Mr. Nobody who doesn't have any Vendetta against John. He's just a guy trying to collect on John's head., but he's so frequent in the movie and when he's now on screen with his dog he's a charming guy. The visuals are stunningly beautifully shot very well-lit, amazing camera angles. There's one shootout with an overhead view and it's a straight-up video game it's awesome. The only cons that could be made about the movie are the run time. Unlike Parabellum where it just got so carried away with the action that it started to become desensitizing. And the between scenes were lackluster. Here it trying to wrap up the series your gonna want to go all out. Conclude Character arcs and all that.

It's the ultimate visual feast of blood, bullets and magic, yes magic, read on.It started with JW getting out of the situation alive (again) after falling off the top of hotel continental and continue to rid the world of fellow hitmen (yeah why were there no hitwemen, just wondering).Except that he gets a partner this time, no one else but Ip Man himself, or maybe Zatoichi, yeah more like Zatoichi with eyes can't see, and a cane sword (sword cane)? And aptly named 'Cane'. Except that Cane kills him at the end, anyway that's not important.What's important is, the action! The action is over the top (not that the first 3 wasn't over the top, but this time it's over the topmost of the previous tops), so normally JW uses the ground as his weapon, now he uses cars as well, and stairs.Damn I would hate these stairs, especially when you just finished climbing up 20 flights of stairs and got kicked back to the very begining of it. But they do act as effective weapons when you toss the body of your enemies on top the stairs.And the magic!First of all, the fantastic animal, this time, in a dog form, who listens to her emotional support companion (the tracer)'s commands, and acts accordingly. Honestly I think she needs anger management that's why she has an emotional support human for her.Then there's the weapon that shoots fireballs and light up anything they touch - just like in the games - yeah also top down view, reminds me of the orginal psx grand theft auto, but way more fancier. Heck even the ragdoll movements of the bodies were just so ... identical. I totally enjoyed that.That's 2 and half hours total enjoyment without a break - don't drink too much water before or during the movie and you can thank me later.Now, why only 8 points?Well, also the action - they must have changed the action director cos this time the enemies don't swarm JW anymore, they wait, like civialised citizens, they take turns to hit him, and only when the first one is down the second one will join, there was no rush at all.

I was so excited to see this movie and now I feel so let down. I come to see \"John Wick\" films for the immaculate and creative fight choreography. Do not walk into this movie expecting any of that. All the purism which caused the first three films to shine is gone. The \"John Wick\" franchise has completely disappeared up its own a*s. This goofy underworld the movies created only worked when a normal world still existed in the Wick Universe. But there is no \"real world\" anymore. Every single character in this movie looks cartoonish, like a steampunk caricature of a real person. Even the villains were painfully cartoonish, one of them even sporting a full mouth full of ridiculous gold teeth. I couldn't even look at him without laughing.Now, let's discuss the action and the fight choreography, the two biggest letdowns about this film. This was not just bad fight choreography for the Wick universe, this was bad fight choreography for a straight-to-streaming action movie of the week. As Wick is fighting various henchmen in the ubiquitous club fight scene that goes down in every Wick movie, you can literally see the enemy assailants waiting their turn to attack him. Numerous times, you can clearly see a henchman in the background literally just standing there swinging his weapon at nothing because it isn't his turn yet in the choreography to attack Wick.Also, the \"Gun-Fu\" crap was novel and fun in the first two movies, now it's completely taken over. Rather than the dazzling martial arts, melee weapons, and close quarters combat we've come to expect from this franchise, we're now forced to settle for an endless barrage of gunfire and gratuitous headshots. There is very little actual brawling in this film. It's like the scene in Indiana Jones when he opts to just shoot the sword-wielding henchman rather than actually fight him. \"John Wick: Chapter 4\" is just that scene repeated over and over and over again. Every time a new villain squares off to John and appears that they will be formidable, Wick just shoots them in the head immediately without even so much as a slap fight to satiate our palettes. It gets so boring to watch really fast. I think Keanu is getting up there in years and can't quite bring the fury like he used to; so, the filmmakers decided to just let him shoot everybody rather than fight them.Now, let's go back to the big club scene and talk about how unrealistic this movie is. During the scene, the sprawling night club is packed to the rafters with club goers who appear to be dancing to different music than that which is playing. That's not even close to the silliest thing about them though. As though they were brainless party bots that knew only how to dance, these morons would just stand there gyrating poorly to generic Cyberpunk music while people were being brutally slaughtered by axe right next to them. None of them bats an eye, runs away, or attempts to protect themselves. They just keep on dancing like the NPCs inside a night club on Grand Theft Auto. It was some of the most negligent filmmaking I've ever seen.Simply put, there was no grace to this film and it was a horrible way to end the franchise. To all of you out there saying that this is \"the best action film of all time,\" maybe you should rent \"The Raid: Redemption\" or \"The Raid 2.\" Those are action films done so well they were basically art films. Iko Uwais is the most talented martial arts working in film today. Or, even easier, go rent \"Atomic Blonde.\" As a former ballerina, Charlize Theron was able to memorize in excess of twenty moves at a time, which resulted in the directors needing to cut much less frequently, creating a very seamless, realistic effect to her fight scenes. The director referred to her as belonging to \"the top 1% of actors who can perform their own action.\" \"Atomic Blonde\" is one of the best action films of all time and no one seemed to notice it. Such a crime...Anyway, \"John Wick: Chapter 4\" sucked. You're better off staying home and sticking your head in the oven. Don't waste your money seeing this film in the theaters. It'll be on cable eventually, so just wait for it. This movie is where dreams go to die.

I commend them for trying, but it's still done in a far too surface-level way to be impactful. The writers really glossed over some pretty heavy plot points whose consequences should have been explored in greater detail, and because of this, I didn't feel anything I think they wanted me to feel when the film ended.But this is a minor complaint for a movie like this.

Can see the level effort he put on the stunt sequence. Came angle from the roof POV was awesome. Fight in steps was mind blowing. Climax was like cherry on top. Not the end end, the one before.

I really don't know how they made those sequences. The action scenes are very professionally designed. The lighting and sound are excellent. The synchronization of the music and the action sequences is wonderful. The actors are very good. They played amazing, especially the blind killer and Keanu Reeves. The only bad part of the movie was that John Wick was not injured very much, but it can be said that because of the jacket he was wearing, it was made of Kevlar, and Kevlar is stronger than steel at the same weight. And it is a very powerful impactor, and for this reason, John Wick was very little injured when hitting objects and being thrown. And the reason why the enemies do not headshot John Wick is that they are very beginners and it is very difficult and professional to headshot with a simple Colt caliber. And in all war training, they say that the priority is to shoot the body. In the movie, we saw that the bullets hit John's jacket at close range, and he put his jacket in front of the bullet like Zorro. The only problem with the movie was its long time. John Wick's death was very touching and sad. He was just a lonely man in love.

My favourite side characters were Nobody, Shimazu, and Caine.John takes some hits, serious fall damage but these are the movies not real life hahaha. It's a spectacle on a grand scale.Very small nitpicks, the fights are all superb but I would like some more intimate fights for eg JW1, when they entered his house it felt more threatening, and that's it hahaha it's personal preference as a nitpick which is pretty darn good.JW4 is definitely the best of the sequels and up there with the first in my opinion! 8.5/10.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 33, "votes": 54}, "heading": "Just have fun out there", "date": "2023-03-23T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8947061"}, {"content": "Indiana jones, terminator, predator, Jurassic park, the matrix, Jason bourne, etc. All amazing franchises but all share a common trait of having a bad or forgettable movie or 2 at some point.

The choreography was the best I've ever seen in any action movie and it never felt boring. For a movie almost 3 hours long it never got boring you were always hyped up about what's going to happen next. The camera work was phenomenal following Wick to iconic places such as Japan, Sahara Desert(probably),Paris,Berlin,New York etc. But what I really appreciated about this movie was that despite having less dialogue than action you really had feelings about the other characters than John. Caine's character (Donnie Yen) was tremendous at his job. He made himself a believable blind men without making his character such as Daredevil. When you first saw you him you instantly hated him but with the movie progressing you started to like him. Marquis (Bill Skasgard) gave you the vibe of a hateful villain from the start and keeping that vibe irritating you through the whole movie. The tracker (Shamier Anderson) was a fun character also being more a anti-hero than a villain giving us memories from the first John Wick with his dog. And the comeback of some iconic characters such as Charon,Winston and King.

Tired, stupid, annoying. Only 1 great gunfight (a GLORIOUS top down, exploding shotgun shells, massacre) & 1 good hand-to-hand fight (with an unrecognisable #ScottAdkins), the rest of the action's dull, repetitive, silliness. #KeanuReeves (effective in the other 3 films) here gives a truly appalling performance. He sounds like his batteries are running out, every....word....is....emotionless. His opening scene might THE worst acting seen in cinema history...& he only says \"Yeah\"!.\nWhere once Wick dodged damage by using his skills to not get hit (& we could genuinely see how he avoided it), now he just brushes off 'Superman' level damage (it's so ridiculous it gets genuinely annoying...from plummeting off buildings, to getting hit by multiple speeding cars, to smashing down 100's of stone steps) that makes EVERY fight pointless (who cares if he gets punched, when bone crushing falls literally do no damage)? Assassins suddenly either don't bother to shoot or punch him when they have a chance, or simply can't hit him even if when he's standing still! But who cares anyway right, when he's now seemingly made of Adamantium!?.\nAnd why tediously rehash \"Rogue One\" by making #DonnieYen blind again? Worse, it just adds to the annoying stupidity. That a blind swordsman could hear his enemy move, or feel the air moving when a sword strikes, makes (a fantastical) sense. But how does a blind man dodge getting shot by multiple gunmen standing 20-30 feet away? Can he 'hear' the direction a gun is pointing? What utter nonsense. In fact he's so not effected by being blind...why make him blind?!.\nThere's also a sorry lack of links to the other 3 films. You could watch this & fully understand most of it. Bar Fishburne, Reddick & McShane no characters return & even the shocking betrayal by #IanMcShane in \"3\" (including shooting Wick off a building) is completely ignored by the plot AND Wick! He's just back to being a friend & ally again as if nothing happened. Hell, even the damn dog gets ignored!.\nThe fact is if \"3\" had a better final 3rd with a satisfying ending we would've had a truly great action franchise trilogy.

There was never any indication how they received the information instantaneously or why all the assassins happened to be listening to the radio at the same time.

After watching Parabellum, and slightly wondering if the caliber and scope of it can be overtaken, I was gladly mistaken after seeing this film.

The film delivers on its promise of epic wall-to-wall action, with stunning choreography, inventive set pieces, and brutal violence. But it also offers more than just mindless spectacle, as it explores John Wick's personal journey, his motivations, and his connections with other characters.The film picks up where John Wick: Chapter 3 - Parabellum (2019) left off, with John being betrayed by Winston (Ian McShane), the manager of The Continental hotel in New York, and thrown off a building. John survives with the help of his old friend Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), who leads a network of underground informants. Together, they decide to wage war against The High Table and its enforcer, The Marquis (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd), a ruthless and cunning adversary who will stop at nothing to eliminate John Wick.John travels across the globe to seek allies and resources for his fight, from Berlin to Paris to Tokyo. Along the way, he encounters familiar faces such as Charon (Lance Reddick), Winston's loyal concierge; Sofia (Halle Berry), a former colleague who owes him a favor; and Zero (Mark Dacascos), a former rival who respects him. He also meets new allies such as Doc Q (Donnie Yen), an old friend from his past; Kazuya (Hiroyuki Sanada), a Japanese crime lord who has a history with John; and Akane (Rina Sawayama), Kazuya's daughter and prot\u00e9g\u00e9.The film is directed by Chad Stahelski, who has helmed all four John Wick films so far. He brings his expertise in stunt coordination and martial arts to create some of the most impressive action sequences ever seen on screen. The film features a variety of styles and weapons, from hand-to-hand combat to gunfights to sword fights to car chases. The film also pays homage to classic action films such as The Matrix trilogy (which also starred Reeves and Fishburne) and Kill Bill Vol. 1 & 2.The film is not without its flaws, however. Some may find the plot too thin or convoluted, or the dialogue too cheesy or exposition-heavy. Some may also find the violence too excessive or gratuitous, or the tone too dark or grim. The film also runs for almost three hours, which may test some viewers' patience or attention span.Nevertheless, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a thrilling and satisfying conclusion to one of the most successful action franchises of all time. It showcases Keanu Reeves' charisma and commitment as an actor and an action star. It also expands on the rich mythology and world-building of the John Wick universe. It is a must-watch for fans of action cinema and for anyone who enjoys watching Keanu Reeves kick ass.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 3}, "heading": "John Wick: Chapter 4 (2023) critical review", "date": "2023-03-23T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8946388"}, {"content": "Now thats how you make the final chapter.

I've always been a great admirer of the practical action sequences portrayed in the 'John Wick' films.Undoubtedly, 'John Wick Chapter 1' remains my favorite, followed closely by Chapter 3. It definitely has something to do with the fact that the type of action and gun-fu felt so new back then. That is also the one main thing this fourth film suffers from in my opinion: innovativeness. Though this issue only really exists throughout the first half of the film.The Paris sequences & pretty much all action sequences featuring Donnie Yen (as 'Caine') serve as a breathe of fresh air in this film. Some new weapons and technology such as the bow & arrow, the nunchucks and some fancy incendiary bullets make certain action scenes a joy to watch. Though the other sequences are certainly cool, I can't help but feel like I've seen it quite a few times already.The cinematography was definitely at it's highest point in this fourth film. The movie was absolutely gorgeous. The colors are vibrant and ultramodern, almost in a science fiction-y way. The way action sequences are shot have always been amazing; from long takes to overhead shots, back to running between cars on the Champs-Elysees and dueling like it's the wild west. It's a lot of bloody fun! I'm slightly saddened by the fact so much action was shot in dark and distractingly lit environments, but overall the practicality of it all was still there.I enjoyed the music more in the prior movies, though I haven't separately listened to the OST yet so I know what to do. Sound design, costumes and world building is another massive win for me. I love this world they've managed to create full of assassins and strange people. It was nice to explore so many different countries and 'continentals'. It really helped with making this film different from the others.Keanu Reeves is always a joy to watch, what else can I say? I'm also very happy they brought in legends like Clancy Brown, Donnie Yen and Hiroyuki Sanada. Their skills and overall badass vibes just fit so fell in this world. Speaking of legends, I'm saddened by the recent passing of Lance Reddick, who portrayed 'Charon' the concierge. I'm glad to have seen him one last time in this role and I pay my respects.Overall I rate this film a 8/10, on par for me with chapter 2.

In fact all three of the first films have the same IMDb rating of 7.4/10 and I noticed recently that I gave them all the same rating of 8/10. Incredibly, I think 'John Wick: Chapter 4' is the best the series has to offer. This movie was a wild ride.I was a little disappointed when I first saw the runtime for this one was going to be almost 3 hours. I find that is becoming a tough runtime for a lot of films to justify. This film does it with no trouble. The pacing is so incredibly fast that the 3 hours pass by in no time. I remember looking down at my watch early in the film thinking maybe 20-25 minutes had gone by and almost an hour had already passed.A large reason for this is the action sequences. When an action sequence starts in this film buckle in, because it is going to go for nearly 20-30 minutes and be non-stop craziness the for the duration.The action sequences in this film are perfectly shot as they always are in this series. Lovely, wide camera angles so we can see every thing that happens and know that it isn't all being edited to look this way. These people are actually doing these things.As always with these films you need to go in a rather incredible suspension of belief. Wick is nearing super-human level at this point. It doesn't matter how many cars you hit him with or how high the building he falls off is, he'll be back and fighting again 10 seconds later. It's best to switch your brain off at these points I have found.Finally, I loved the main villain in this movie played excellently by Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd. He was everything a villain should be.

Once again directed by Chad Stahleski and starring Keanu Reeves in the title role, it stands out as not only the best film in the series but also as one of the very best action films made in recent decades.Shortly after the events of the third film, John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is in the planning stages of taking down the powerful High Table once and for all. After executing the Elder (George Georgiou), a man ranked above the High Table, John travels to Osaka to seek refuge in their local Continental Hotel. While there, John learns from the manager that his old blind friend Caine (Donnie Yen) and a bounty hunter known only as \"Mr. Nobody\" (Shamier Anderson) have each been ordered to assassinate him by a High Table member named Marquis Vincent de Gramont (Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd). As he fights off various other assassins, John eventually meets up with New York's Continental manager Winston Scott (Ian McShane), who may hold the key to disbanding the High Table permanently.Almost a decade since its debut, the \"John Wick\" series has cemented itself as one of the most popular action film franchises to ever grace movie theatres. The films are known for their highly stylised action scenes, memorable supporting characters, and intriguing world building elements that always make audiences come back for more. At the centre of it all is of course Keanu Reeves, who has helped the titular character become one of the most recognisable action heroes of all time. Now four films in, you would expect the series to show signs of losing some steam but \"John Wick: Chapter 4\" proves all doubters wrong with an exhilarating action-packed experience that leaves other similar films in the dust.Now that he's \"excommunicado\", the stakes are at an all time high as we see John facing off against even more dangerous adversaries than before. Anybody who's watched these films since the beginning will know that John's worldwide infamy makes it increasingly difficult for him to find allies willing to assist, especially considering how the bounty on his head keeps rising with every powerful enemy he makes. Because of that, there's more tension this time around than in previous entries, allowing less room for error at the risk of sudden death. Most of the time, John relies solely on his own wit and ingenuity to take out his enemies, whether it's with his simple handgun or with any part of the surrounding environment. John is a resourceful assassin, not blinding shooting at any moving target but instead calculating the right time and technique to take out a particular foe, no matter how minor. It is this trait that separates a character like John Wick from the rest of the typical action heroes, as contemplating his next move is what has made him so interesting to watch over the past four films.Something else I've admired about \"John Wick\" series is the attention-to-detail that goes into virtually every scene. Regardless of where things are taking place, there's so much visual beauty and creativity on display in each shot. This film is certainly no exception as it contains some truly breathtaking cinematography that places the audience right at the forefront of the action. If these scenes don't rejuvenate you, then you probably have no pulse. From the brightly coloured neon lights of Osaka to the raving nightlife of Berlin, every location oozes so much personality that they almost become characters in their own right. It is in these places that some of the best choreographed, best edited, and best filmed fight scenes in recent memory are able to firmly establish this fourth entry as one of the most exciting action films to ever be released in theatres. Yet despite all the frenetic shoot-outs and hand-to-hand combat, they are all handled with such careful precision that it is still easy to follow everything happening without losing focus of who is fighting who. And to top it all off, at no point is shaky cam ever used during the action scenes, which makes these already entertaining segments even better.For someone approaching his 60s, Keanu Reeves shows absolutely no signs of slowing down in the iconic lead role. Every shot that he fires, every punch that he throws, and every sword that he swings proves that Reeves can still hold his own alongside any younger cast members. There were even times where I couldn't help but notice some of the other supporting cast struggling to keep up with Reeves, which helped make him stand out quite considerably. Although the character of John Wick has never really had a huge amount of depth behind him, he definitely has a level of intrigue, something I think Reeves is able to play into perfectly. He is man of few words, whose widespread notoriety and respect from other assassins combined with his compassion for the defenseless makes him an endearing hero for the audience to cheer for. After all, it's easy to care about somebody who has risked everything to avenge the death of his dog.Additionally, I don't think the film would have worked half as well without John's two worthy opponents - Donnie Yen as Caine and Shamier Anderson as Mr. Nobody. Yen's depiction of Caine draws comparisons to that of Marvel's Daredevil, in that he is blind but a highly skilled martial artist relying on his other senses to defeat enemies. Caine's proficiency in combat is so unparalleled that each time I saw him fight I kept forgetting about his blindness since his reflexes are so unusually fast. However, what I liked most was the mutual respect between him and John, being that they were once close friends in the past. On the other hand, Mr. Nobody is completely different as he has no personal connection to John. He is only doing this job for the money but along the way he learns that John is a force to be reckoned with. It is interesting to watch how Mr. Nobody learns more about John as the film progresses, and Anderson successfully brings out all the necessary layers of curiosity surrounding his character.Even after four movies, the \"John Wick\" series is still as impactful as it was when it first started, with each film being better than the last. What began as a relatively straightforward story of a man seeking revenge against those who killed his dog is now a multi-layered, action-packed, and beautifully shot set of films that exists within its own meticulously crafted world.

For me, a John Wick movie must, and I say this again, must make you eager for the thought of John Wick taking his revenge from other villians.

Also the set design from Osaka to Paris was gorgeous and had so many small details that i couldnt keep my eyes off the screen. We had also the story who introduced the new vilain who supposed to be French and was pretty convincing. We have also some interesting discoveries all along during the movie (the blind man who have his daughter in hostage, the way to put an end to all this and to recover the status of the guy in charge of the continental who get destroyed in the movie. The fights feel great even if we know that match a certain choregraphy and dont reflect a real fight but it was well made and have some interesting shots (when at the end they all tried to kill Wick in the building and the camera shot from above all the scene and transform it like a mini map). Some scenes really look gorgeous and awesome and like i said i saw so many action movies but this one was really different; even in the work of the lights and how they put the lights to create a certain tone. It was pretty effective and sometimes some scenes was pretty funny (with the dog). The end is pretty sad and thought that John Wick will made it trough all that but he died. The Caine Character have an interesting style: the way he fights, but i think it was not necessary to make him blind because some scenes lack of logic sometimes and questions us to the believable situations that dont feel believable sometimes(the fights, the fact that nobody had the idea to shot him in the head quickly)but it was ok and give a new opponent/friend to John Wick in this episode. Give it a try. The actions scenes (because its mostly an action movie)was pretty awesome (Arc de Triomphe, Osaka, sacr\u00e9 coeur).

Each conversation has a purpose, each scene makes a point. From the gunfight samurai scene in Tokyo to the phosphorus gunfight shot from above in Paris, the action doesn't diminish. Normally a sequel is \"lesser\" but John Wick 4 simply builds onto the quadrilogy. It makes sense, it continues the story and the characters get all the more interesting.I can tell you right now, if the phosphorus gunfight scene doesn't impress you (which it will), the Paris traffic carnage scene is brilliant. I can't say I have ever seen someone do full continuous 360 drifting in a muscle car either :DI know Keanu said that Chad Stahelski and himself were taking a long break from the John Wick series but should we have seen the end, it ended on a note I feel we could live with.

At that time, I had no plans at all what film to watch, so I finally decided to watch John Wick after seeing Keanu starring in him, I'm a huge fan of the Matrix. Also, I don't know what the film is about, what genre it is.After dozens of minutes of watching, I was dumbfounded. John Wick's character is very unique as an assassin -melancholy, his heart is soft so he can cry sadly, his nature is serious and quiet but sadistic and cold-blooded - and his gun-fu action is very cool. Of the hundreds of films I've watched since I was a child, none of the martial arts action films are as good as this one.A month ago, I purposely re-watched JW123 before watching JW4 last night which I've been waiting for since last year, to refresh my memory so it's more connected with the storyline. The result? Very satisfactory. JW4 is better than all three. Better in terms of selecting new supporting actors, cinematography, storyline, action choreography and in terms of Keanu's acting.1. Brilliant selection of new characters.Of the several new supporting actors, Donnie Yen brilliantly managed to play a very significant role in building the story of JW4. His acting is flexible, his appearance is cool, his action is cool, and his refreshing sense of humor helps reduce tension while watching this film, which is about 80% filled with gun-fu scenes. Previously I was a little disappointed with the selection of Mark Dacascos in JW3.2. Beautiful cinematography.If you pay close attention, there are a number of things related to cinematography that are relatively different from the previous three series. Starting from the sound system, lighting techniques, color themes and shooting angles. There are a number of scenes that remind me of the Matrix trilogy, including fights under a fountain that looks like rain and a scene at a train station. And the most special, the angle of shooting a la bird view in a fight scene.3. The storyline is more natural with a perfect ending.The outline of the story is about John Wick's efforts to free himself from the pressure of The High Table caused by his own actions, breaking the rules by killing Santino D'Antonio in The Continental of New York hotel. At first he had thought of killing all members of The High Table, but his close friends opposed the idea. The ending of the story is perfect, but it's better if I don't tell.4. Better duration, level and beauty of gun-fu action.The duration of the film is almost three hours. In some scenes, I almost felt bored, but the director cleverly stopped it and moved on to another scene at the right time. The fight choreography feels more beautiful and seems natural.5. Acting Keanu Reeves.In several scenes, John Wick's expressions and body gestures are clearly seen to be exhausted, moreover his opponents are really tougher. On his face were lines that showed he was on the verge of despair. This acting is the main part that makes the ending of the story perfect.After watching JW4, regardless of whether there was an intentional element of the story writer and director, it's as if JW123 was deliberately made only to form the perfection of the JW4 film. So, it is only fitting that JW4 will be flooded with praise from film critics such as IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes. Most likely this film will become the Top Box Office.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 6, "votes": 11}, "heading": "What Makes John Wick 4 A Flood of Praise?", "date": "2023-03-22T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8944183"}, {"content": "John wick is a power house of action movie franchise,\n1-3 were incredible for being an advancement in cinematography and choreography and incredible stunt work, so when they announced a fourth one, well, I was anticipating yet another awesome movie.I was...

Along the way, he faces new enemies and allies, as well as old friends and foes.The movie is a feast for action fans, as it showcases some of the most impressive and inventive fight scenes ever put on screen. From gunfights to knife fights, from car chases to horse chases, from Paris to Tokyo, John Wick: Chapter 4 never lets up on the adrenaline and excitement. Keanu Reeves once again proves his dedication and skill as an action star, performing most of his own stunts and delivering his trademark deadpan humor.The movie also deepens its mythology, exploring more aspects of The High Table's history and hierarchy. We learn more about John Wick's past and his connection to other characters in this world. We also meet new faces that add more flavor and diversity to the franchise. Donnie Yen plays Caine, a fellow assassin who shares a bond with John Wick. Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd plays Marquis, a mysterious figure who has ties to The High Table. Hiroyuki Sanada plays Shimazu, a ruthless leader of a Japanese crime syndicate.The movie is not without its flaws, however. At nearly three hours long, it feels bloated and overstuffed at times. Some scenes drag on for too long or feel unnecessary. Some plot points are confusing or underdeveloped. Some characters are underused or wasted. The movie also relies heavily on fan service and references to previous films, which may alienate newcomers or casual viewers.Overall, John Wick: Chapter 4 is a satisfying conclusion (or is it?) to one of the best action franchises of recent years.

Donnie Yen, Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd, and Lance Reddick join the cast, and their performances are nothing short of outstanding.Yen, a martial arts legend, brings his incredible skills to the movie and delivers some of the most brutal and cool action scenes in the film. Skarsg\u00e5rd plays a new villain who is as menacing as he is unpredictable, and his scenes with Reeves are intense and thrilling. Reddick, who has been a fan favorite since the first movie, continues to shine as the enigmatic hotel manager, and his interactions with John Wick are as entertaining as ever.The movie is directed by Chad Stahelski, who has been with the franchise since its inception, and he continues to showcase his expertise in creating thrilling and visually stunning action sequences.But it's not just the acting that makes John Wick 4 a standout action movie. The work of the stuntmen is absolutely incredible. The fight scenes are brutal and fast-paced, and the choreography is flawless. Every punch, kick, and gunshot feels real and impactful, and it's clear that a lot of time and effort went into perfecting each moment. The use of practical effects and minimal CGI is also noteworthy, as it makes the action feel more grounded and visceral.The supporting cast in John Wick 4 also deserves recognition for their performances. Halle Berry is a standout, and her character's relationship with John Wick adds an emotional layer to the movie. Laurence Fishburne and Ian McShane, who both appeared in previous films, continue to deliver excellent performances, and their characters' interactions with John Wick are always a joy to watch.The music in John Wick 4 is yet another aspect that deserves praise. Tyler Bates and Joel J. Richard once again provide a score that perfectly complements the action on screen. The music builds tension and excitement, and it enhances the overall experience of watching the movie.Of course, as with any action movie, there are some flaws.

Thanks to Chad Stahelski and Keanu Reeve's knowledge of the technical aspects of shooting action, they've been able to deliver expertly choreographed, shot, and edited action films that are now the go to as examples of great action filmmaking. And so, the expectations for the fourth film were fairly high, especially as it became more apparent this was not only the culmination of everything before it, but a whopping 169 minutes long. Rest assured, however, that it delivers in spades. Everything we have come to know and love is here, but with an infusion of creativity like we haven't seen from the franchise yet.John Wick is in a bad way as we open up. He's a man on a mission to get out from under the High Table with seemingly no end in sight. As he blazes a trail of bullets and corpses, those who have helped him or crossed his path find their own lives disrupted. With all hope lost, he soon finds the opportunity he's looking for when he discovers that he can put his life on the line for a chance to finally get out. The film brings with it a whole host of new characters, including Donnie Yen's Caine, Shamier Anderson's Tracker, Hiroyuki Senada's Shimazu, Rina Sawayama's (in a fantastic big screen debut) Akira, Scott Adkins' Killa, and of course Bill Skarsgard as new villain Marquis. It's a full cast, but everyone gets a chance to shine and could easily have their own films. Donnie Yen in particular demonstrates, once again, that he is a legend in this industry with several great fights of his own. But, of course, this is Keanu's film all the way and he gets to bring everything with him in the biggest film yet.Covering four continents, we get fights on a massive set of stairs, fights in the middle of traffic, at one of the coolest looking hotels ever shown on screen, and so on. The fighting, of course, is exceptional, and it brings nunchakus, dogs, throwing stars, swords, guns, and so much more. It's everything a John Wick fan could want and, because these films are so technically proficient, you never feel like you're missing any of the action. Possibly the most creative choice is my favorite scene, one that combines a visually fantastic weapon with a shot choice that is unusual for action films of this nature, but the combination of these two pushes the scene into maybe one of action film's greatest scenes.Admittedly, the story does leave a bit to be desired, but the minor complaints about these kinds of things pale in comparison to what we get.

Sanada, as is always the case, is a strong presence in the film and makes the most of every scene he is in. He is a great addition to the film. The Osaka Continental fight scenes are groundbreaking, and among the best and most exciting in the entire series. This is some of the best fight and action choreography you will see; only topped by other scenes in this same movie.Scott Adkins plays an unusually larger than life villain adeptly. The action and violence around the Berlin scenes involving his character, and his relationship to Reeves' past is fun to watch. Adkins is great to watch, whether starring in his own projects, or supporting, as he is here.Shamier Anderson and Clancy Brown are new to the series and add great value. Anderson as a cunning assassin conflicted between admiration and greed. Clancy Brown is a strong presence and welcome replacement in the role of Adjudicator. I found Asia Kate Dillon's version of the same character to be the weakest part of the prior film, and, perhaps, of the whole series.Mark Zaror, another great martial artist also has a prominent role as The Marquis' right hand man.Ian McShane and Laurence Fishburne return and offer more than just familiarity to the cast. Their roles are significant and meaningful.Donnie Yen brings not only his skills as one of the finest martial arts movie stars in the world, but lends his presence as a charismatic and riveting figure. He plays the role of Caine with complexity and humanity that is a terrific mirror to Reeves' Wick; his friend and adversary by circumstance. This was a fantastic choice to take the Wick series to a new level.Keanu Reeves continues to be engaging, empathetic, and dynamic in the role of John Wick. While the series has strayed a bit from the deeply reluctant anti-hero of the first film; we continue to cheer for the good guy caught up in a bad, bad world. One of the great strengths of the film is that Reeves and Stahelski are not afraid the let characters other than Wick shine. In fact, all of the stars of this one have their deeply profound and memorable moments in and out of the company of the main character. This really works.As for the fight and action choreography. The stunt team at 87eleven continue to elevate the game. The film has three major, larger than life action sequences, that each, individually, outdo anything you will see in any other non John Wick movie. As mentioned previously, the Osaka and Berlin scenes were high energy, high body count affairs. They were complete with gun fights, sword mastery, gun play, and one of the best nunchuck displays you will ever see outside of a Bruce Lee movie. As for the scenes in Paris, at the Arc De Tripomphe, and on the Church steps, they are unlikely to be forgotten and, unlikely, to be topped for years to come, if ever. They are unique and exciting and violent feasts for the eyes.While I have heard some say that John Wick: Chapter 4 is the best installment in the series I have to disagree, Nothing can top the original, in my opinion; however, Chapter 4 is a worthy installment for sure.Will there be a Chapter 5 to the JohnWick saga?

I had no idea. The time just flew right by.Chad Stahelski does not pull any punches (or engage the safety) at any time in this gun-fu epic. Combat scenes are not moments so much as they are entire acts. The amount of stunt choreography that everybody had to synchronize to was rather incredible, and they continue to find more ways to entertain us with kills, kill types, use of weapons, locations, teamwork, etc. I caught myself smiling for minutes on end several times while watching it.Of course though, as I said, they really lean into it. I'm sure this has been true of previous films as well, but it is very apparent that John Wick should virtually die in every scene that he is in. Whether it is how he is attacked or how they fail to attack him at the right times, he goes at every foe like the bear in The Revenant with full adrenaline and no signs of slowing down no matter what he is hit by. And again, I think if you look hard enough you will find enemies who have clear shots and choose not to take them because of plot armor, but you can forgive it enough if you're rewarded with a longer take or overall longer action sequence. What I really loved was how many of these scenes took place at night with dazzlingly lit environments all around, and the music in every scene kicks as much *** as what you see on screen. I had pondered over why John Wick doesn't have a video game yet, but if they ever make one I have decided I'd like one of those top-down shooter games (similar to The Hong Kong Massacre, and if not maybe like the GTA:SA MP rampage style).I acknowledge this franchise for what it is now, but I still pine for some of the missing components that I don't know if it'll ever be able to bring back. After watching John Wick, fun as it was, I found myself interested in seeing a prequel when he was the Baba Yaga in his prime, taking missions rather than being hunted. Even still, at least in that movie he was absolutely feared. In Chapter 2, I still found him heavily respected, but it was in that movie that I realized there would probably be a repetitive formula to the narrative and movie/action structure (which still has yet to break). In Chapter 3, there only lived assassins and they would go after him without hesitation, which did is not how I felt the world breathed the first time around. They continue down this path in Chapter 4, while opening the universe more to different characters breeding their own kind of loyalty. They are all insanely fun to watch, and you see the cogwheels of the John Wick universe spinning with the future Continental television show and the Ballerina movie spinoff. Where they remain faulty though is even with the existence of civilians during fight scenes, they act as droning NPC's like nothing is happening around them, or they aren't there whatsoever. It is clear that this is not our world that this movie takes place in, but rather a parallel one.I mentioned the introduction of new characters in this world, and you can't not bring up Donnie Yen when talking about them. He steals each and every scene that he is in, and it's crazy because you wonder how a character like his could thrive in such a world but you absolutely believe it when you watch it. I will absolutely take more of him and Rina Sawayama. She isn't featured as much, but she makes use of every second that she is in front of the camera. There are plenty of others (such as the great Hiroyuki Sanada), but the point remains that Wick is relegated to this greater universe with characters who-good, bad, or for themselves-are ones we can actually root for in any fight. Keanu Reeves is understandably less nimble at his age than the others (and it's either bad acting or he really has taken on this John Wick role in his line delivery to hilarious new heights), but he and Stahelski have found a groove that still makes him the most impenetrable force around, to the point that I go back and watch the action scenes in The Matrix Resurrections and wonder what happened there. I didn't love one particular character in their big fighting moment(s), but they go for versatility and I have to give them that much.March has had an incredible run of theatrical films, and John Wick: Chapter 4 is no different. You will lean forward during the action which there is plenty, and if I'm one to go off of you will not feel the runtime. There is an end credits scene as well if you're able to stay for a moment longer. I would love to go back and see this one again.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 146, "votes": 199}, "heading": "May possibly be the best John Wick, but is absolutely the most John Wick.", "date": "2023-03-17T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8935086"}, {"content": "Keanu Reeves is freaking Awesome this is by far his best performance yet.

Director Chad Stahelski's John Wick: Chapter 4 is no exception. And it abundantly delivers on the franchise's hallmarks - snazzy guns, lovable dogs, and one very haggard man in black. John Wick: Chapter 4 isn't a movie you casually sit down to watch apropos of nothing. It's a commitment, both in terms of how long it is and in how invested you really have to be in the idea of John Wick for the film to be engaging. To its credit, John Wick: Chapter 4 does an admirable job of leaving open possibilities for a future filled with stories of some of the movie's new supporting characters. It comes as a pleasant surprise given how much time this story spends trying to remind you that Wick is the baddest man in town. It's a movie that's meant to be watched loud and big. Remember !

The patina and the screenplay are always those of a very high-budget b-movie, full of nonsense and absurdity without explanation: at a certain point one would hope for a narrative turn that goes a bit deeper to explain why the good Keanu Reeves still takes more beatings than usual without ever dying. But nothing, not even that suggestion that had made us think of a parallelism between the Matrix and John Wick is addressed. Too bad, because the idea that Wick was a sort of spin off from the sci-fi dystopia created by the Wachowski sisters could have been suggestive, but I think it was a totally random intuition of some dumb spectator like me. In short, this time the 3 hours of duration and meaningless killings weigh even more than usual, because it lacks the magic or mystery of something other than mere entertainment for decerebrated Russian oligarchs or similar, which John Wick has always been since it's first chapter, after all...", "rating": 5, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 53, "votes": 329}, "heading": "Surreal and macabre but meaningless", "date": "2023-03-16T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8932291"}, {"content": "Stuntman turned writer/director Chad Stahelski struck gold with his 2014 surprise hit John Wick. It was somewhat of a comeback for the legendary Keanu Reeves and reinvigorated the action genre. Since then it's become THE action juggernaut franchise. Now we are on number 4 and while usually things get redone with that amount of sequels, this film innovates and thrills to new heights in an absolute epic.One of the most surprising aspects of this particular entry, is the story being written as well as it is. Something that is hard to come by in the genre at times. Not saying the others in the franchise weren't but this is easily the best story diving deeper in the high table aspects as well as John Wick's true emotions . The rich characterization is also at its best with outstanding additions like Skaarsgard, and even more screen time for supporting greats like Fishburne to compliment the magnificent Reeves. RIP Lance Reddick. It's nice to have such substance amongst the endless high octane ballistic visuals.Speaking of ballistic, this movie goes more all out than any I've seen for insanely well crafted choreographed shootout and fight scenes. Just when you thought you've seen it all, Stahelski/Reeves prove their action minds are ever evolving. These guys were born to make action movies together.The extremely vibrant colors and plethora of locations is also a feast for the eyes. The sharp atmospheric imagery creates the ultimate backdrop for not only the action but also just the dialogue. The sound is also top notch and perfectly compliments the intensity. It's just an absolute sensory journey that you don't get in too many action films aside from the Wick genre.Overall the limitless and outrageous action alone is nothing like we've seen before for the genre or just cinema in general . But also this rich unique story may only build Wick's timeless character for more films in the future which at this momentum will be welcomed.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 283, "votes": 357}, "heading": "While the Wick franchise has already solidified itself one of the best in the action genre, this massive film is the most spectacular entry of the genre in 30 years.", "date": "2023-03-16T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8932278"}]}
