But just as they think they are safe an old friend is forced into betrayal.There are three major settings in the second installment of the regional trilogy, Hoth, Dagobah and Bespin. Although the action is (mostly) limited to these locations they are drawn with such care and attention to detail you don't feel any limitation or claustrophobia. The Ice planet feels enormous, the swamp planet truly alive like no other and the cloud giant plain different.The second instalment of the series sees more character development, some passive and some active. This greatly enhance the movie and allows e audience greater insight into the drives and motivations of the motley group. Producing Yoda in such a way that he is easily to accept as a character rather than a puppet was no mean feat and the voice talents of Frank Oz unquestionably breathe life into a pivotal character.The inner darkness that Luke has to fight (actual and metaphorical) is well engineered, could even upset some younger viewers.Vader and Luke's showdown in Cloud City is cinema legend!The two droids are split up but still the central line of the plot, all be it forked into the twin stories of Leia/Han/C-3PO and Luke/R2-D2. This allows the two robots the chance to grow in the hearts of the viewers too, less of a comedy double act. Having said that they still get most of the funny bits.R2-D2's discomfort on Dagobah is palpable. Not bad for a droid that doesn't speak (English).This movie does feel the absence of a movie monolith like Peter Cushing or Alec Guinness. Yes, the latter is present as a apparition but it isn't the same. The primary cast do step up though and pull the viewer on and into the story.Things to look out for: eh?

This film is the epitome of a timeless classic and a must-see for any movie lover. Even if you're not a Star Wars fan, the plot, characters, and special effects will captivate you from beginning to end.The Empire Strikes Back takes us deeper into the Star Wars universe and introduces us to new worlds, creatures, and characters, including the legendary Jedi Master, Yoda. The story follows the Rebel Alliance as they face their toughest challenge yet: the evil Empire has regrouped and is hunting them down. Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker is on a journey to discover the truth about his past and become a Jedi Knight.What makes The Empire Strikes Back stand out from the rest of the Star Wars movies is its darker tone and complex storytelling. The characters face real challenges and the stakes are higher than ever before. The relationships between the characters are also more nuanced, especially the dynamic between Luke, Leia, and Han. And who could forget the iconic plot twist that shocked audiences around the world?One of the things that sets The Empire Strikes Back apart is its stunning visual effects. From the epic battle scenes to the breathtaking landscapes, every shot is a work of art. The music by John Williams is also top-notch and adds to the overall experience.In conclusion, The Empire Strikes Back is a masterpiece of cinema and a true gem in the Star Wars franchise. It's a film that you can watch over and over again and still discover new things to appreciate. As Yoda would say, \"Do or do not.

But still, he was an impatient man who focused more on what was possible or not rather than the belief of necessity where trying was more important than doing. It was exciting to see him evolve, both (soon) as a Jedi Knight and a person himself, and jump right into dangerous challenges, mainly for his friends, but also for himself. The meeting between him and Vader was interesting, especially with their lightsaber fight, which was pleasantly faster than the first movie, and of course their verbal conflict. However, like in the first movie, this one has unfortunately some slow scenes, especially the Dagobah scenes, and the Cloud City scenes (except from the fight between Luke and Vader), which makes some feeling of boredom, even though they were also entertaining. The technical aspects are great, especially the sets and the sound effects, and they truly give a good, cinematic experience.In conclusion, this is a well-executed sequel where the story is more focused on the Force, and it's exciting to see Luke evolve both as a Jedi Knight and a person. The film has its slow moments, but the technical aspects, such as the sets and sound effects, are impressive and provide a great cinematic experience.", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Closer to the Force", "date": "2023-04-28T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9021978", "sentiment score": [0.0008, 0.007, 0.1866, 0.7649, 0.0407]}, {"content": "Arguably the best film from the original trilogy (and entire Star Wars saga), The Empire Strikes Back strikes a more mature tone than it's predecessor; still fantastical and exploring a labyrinth of imagination that you could get lost in, but delving deeper into the mysticism of the force and division between good and evil.Some of the most famous quotes and scenes in cinema history are found within these two hours, influential and replicated or parodied countless times. It's difficult to find someone not aware of the film's 'twist', even if they haven't seen the film, and that cultural impact shows what a behemoth this film is. The storytelling takes an almighty step forward with these plot points, keeping the story engrossing and well paced.Empire sees the introduction of some of the most recognisable characters in media; fan favourites who's mannerisms and qualities endure beyond the film. Without losing any of the core characters from A New Hope, these new characters are integrated well, having meaningful contributions to the story and wider context, without overwhelming screentime.Relationships develop tenfold, creating more chemistry between all the characters, new and old. Whilst more apparent arcs of friendship, romance, and betrayal flourish, smaller interactions between less noticeable relationships show the evolution off screen - such as Chewbacca and C3PO. Leia in particular is given the opportunity to stamp her personality in the film, even more so than previously - an excellent character leading the way instead of falling into the royal category of damsel in distress.Once again, the settings as magnificent, none more so than the original locations in the likes of Hoth and Dagobah. Cloud CIty benefits from Lucas' later edits, but these built sets create such an atmosphere. These are supported by the costuming, props and puppetry, which are as iconic as the heroes utilising them.The soundtrack is still excellent and transitions the story between scenes so well.

The original film gave the audience an opportunity to get to know Hans Solo, Luke Skywalker and Princess Leia as well as robots C3 PO and RQDQ and villain. Darth Vader. The time has been taken for the sequel to really flesh those characters out, and the result means that the audience will root for the 3 heroes all the more even though they had loyalty from the start. There's an amusing battle of the sexes presented with the obviously attracted Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Hans (Harrison Ford), and the youthful Luke (Mark Hamill) truly has become a man after winning the battle against the Death Star. With his rise to power as the main villain, Darth Vader is all the more fascinating, and James Earl Jones is even more commanding than he was before.While I do not consider the original \"Star Wars\" a B movie in any way, and certainly one of the best films of all time let alone science fiction film, the three Years in between films have given an opportunity for the special effects to truly get better, not that they were shabby in the first place, but now they are more sophisticated and even more riveting, and that makes the film more exciting on the action scale. So an already classic film has become all the more memorable with elements that the 1st film didn't get the chance to reveal, Including the now classic plot twist of just who darth data really is. Alec Guinness continues to advise Luke from beyond as Obi-Wan, but he obviously could do this in his sleep, so it's just a nice little cameo to bring some heart and fatherly advice to Luke since he obviously wouldn't get that from his own father. The search for Yoda adds another interesting creature to the series, and fans of the Muppets will be thrilled by his voice.There is still some delightful silliness, as the relationship between C3PO and R2-D2 takes on some touching elements of protection from one to the other, and as complex as certain elements of the story are , the film is delightfully easy to follow even for non fans of science fiction. While Fisher still has a humorous looking hairstyle, the cinnamon bun look is gone, and her attractiveness becomes all the more apparent. In a sense, the acting skills of the three leads has greatly approved, and thus along a somewhat better script, I can see why some viewers have attributed this to be shakespearian in nature which of course comes out in the elements that are revealed about Luke's past. The battle sequence with Luke going after the legs of the walking battleships is brilliant, taking movie art direction to a much more complex level.

I have seen someone state this already, but I will say it again here, as it is a very good reason why this movie is arguably better: character development. We get introduced to the main cast in A New Hope, but even by the end of that film, they're not fully fleshed out yet. We never really get to see how adept Luke is at using The Force, and Darth Vader, one of the most feared men in the galaxy, appears completely subservient to Peter Cushing's character, Grand Moff Tarkin. Episode V takes Star Wars in a risky direction, as Luke is separated from his friends for most of the runtime, but this decision totally paid off and I don't think the movie could have gone any better. The story picks up 3 whole years after Luke has destroyed the Death Star: the Empire's feared space station capable of obliterating entire planets. Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine, the two most powerful men in the Empire, send floating droids all over the galaxy to locate the secret base of the Rebel Alliance (the empire's enemy), under the command of Luke's sister Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). Vader eventually finds what he's looking for and locates what looks like a stronghold on the frigid planet of Hoth. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is investigating an area around the rebel base and is attacked and nearly killed by a yeti-esque creature called a Wampa. Luke manages to slice off one of its arms with his lightsaber and is then rescued by Han Solo (Harrison Ford). Before being saved, Luke sees a vision of his late trainer, Obi-Wan (Alec Guinness) telling him to travel to a planet called Dagobah for some reason. Confident they have the rebel base in their sights, the Imperials launch a brutal onslaught on it using huge, walking, mechanized assault vehicles called AT AT's that decimate everything in their path. Luke and a few other rebels pilot rather slow spaceships known as snowspeeders in order to destroy the imperial walkers by tying their legs with tow cables and then blasting the weak armor on their neck joints. Despite their best efforts, the base is hit too hard and has to evacuate. Leia, Han, C-3PO, Chewbacca and R2D2 pile into the Millennium Falcon, Solo's rather mediocre but dependable starship, and fly off just as Vader enters the hangar. Luke doesn't regroup with his allies right away, and instead flies to the planet Dagobah as Obi-Wan's ghost told him to. Upon arriving in the planet's atmosphere, he loses control of his X-Wing and crashes into a swamp. Here, he meets Yoda, a centuries old Jedi Master who trains Luke in the way of the force. While Han and the others try to elude Vader's fleet of ships and star destroyers by weaving through asteroid fields, Luke expresses frustration at the difficulty of his training. He knows the force seems to be a magical aura of divine, supernatural energy that surrounds everything and inhabits all living beings, but he is not willing to put up with the time required to bend it to his will. Yoda makes things easier for him and uses his mastery over the force to easily lift Luke's crashed spaceship out of the swamp using only his mind. Luke quits his training early to pursue his friends to a planet called Bespin, since he can tell they're walking into a trap. Concurrently, Han Solo and the others arrive at Cloud City on bespin; a huge floating metropolis situated entirely in the sky. There, they meet Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), who is a no good smuggler (like Han) and an old acquaintance of his. While on cloud city, Lando reveals to the group that he's actually betrayed them to the empire. Vader, accompanied by the ruthless bounty hunter Boba Fett, take Han to a specialized chamber where he is frozen in carbonite so Boba can transport him to Jabba the Hutt for a reward. As the group (minus Solo) tries to fight their way out of cloud city, Luke comes face to face with Vader. Even with the force training he has received, Luke is no match for the dark lord's lightsaber proficiency and powerful strikes. Vader corners Luke, severs his hand, and reveals he is actually his father. Vader wants his son to join him so they can kill Palpatine together and end this galactic war, but Luke refuses and lets himself fall down a waste disposal chute that leads directly out of cloud city. Barely managing to hang on to a flimsy piece of metal, Leia senses something isn't right and flies underneath cloud city to rescue her brother. The ship jumps to hyperspace, slipping out of Vader's grasp once again. Back on a rebel medical ship, Luke receives an artificial right hand, and Lando promises to look for his friend Solo. Aside from the fact that this is a star wars movie, there are no doubt a ton of other reasons why it is worthy of adoration. Probably the most visually obvious reason are the special effects. Despite being over 4 decades old, this movie still looks great, and the effects will always look good no matter what year it is. The battle on hoth is amazing. We see the empire's enormous AT AT tanks, and how even their footsteps cause destruction. We see the millennium falcon get chased by massive, dagger shaped spaceships. Most of all, we see much appreciated character development. Luke still hasn't mastered all his force powers by the end of this movie, but he's come a long way thanks to Yoda. Speaking of which, Frank Oz did a great job puppeteering him and basically created one of cinema's most beloved characters. Even the villains are interesting and likable. Vader I believe needs no introduction, but he contrasts heavily with how he was in the first film. He's completely in control here and does what he wants, unlike in episode IV where Tarkin bosses him around, and episode VI where Palpatine does. While still a cool bad guy, it's always annoyed me how Boba Fett is consistently ranked as one of star wars' most popular characters, mostly just because of how he looks. He only has 4 lines in this entire movie, but he's still memorable for being one of the few people who can talk back to Vader and still be alive afterwards. It's not like I need to state the obvious, but John Williams' score really serves to make an epic film even more epic. All I have to say for my closing remark is that The Empire Strikes Back has clearly secured its place as one of the most well made star wars films, which should be common knowledge for any fan of this immortal franchise.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 5, "votes": 5}, "heading": "\"It is your destiny\"", "date": "2022-09-04T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8513636", "sentiment score": [0.0231, 0.2902, 0.5576, 0.1229, 0.0062]}, {"content": "In this Episode V the prologue has much more logic.

My favorite films are those that depict the story before it has been shown, and the title alone, clearly foreshadows what's to expect in this film. It reveals a tragedy in which we see the first glimpse of victory for the Galactic Empire since the fall of the dreaded Death Star.If there's one thing I've noticed with Empire, it's that it's more of a 'darker' film that is particularly shown through the perspective of Darth Vader. After only 8 minutes of screen time in Star Wars, Empire has really given us the chance to delve into his backstory, and really understand more about the mysterious figure behind the mask. I say figure because he has no formal identity, and we as the audience are given the challenge of making our own assumptions. As we've come to expect, Darth Vader is intriguingly more involved during this installment, as his intimidating demeanor continues to shroud our interpretation of the character, and his relationships with other characters, in particular Luke, which is quite the treat and one of the most captivating moments of the whole film. They really couldn't have selected a better, more talented actor than James Earl Jones, who I feel doesn't receive as much recognition for the role than he deserves. With all due respect to the great David Prowse who did great in the suit, Jones truly enlightens the character. His voice is really special, and a lot of aspiring actors look up to him.Throughout the film we also explore the relationship between Leia and Han and how their story becomes a core part of this film, and the introduction to so many new and loving characters such as Lando and Yoda, including countless planets which continue to expand. Of course, I can't write a review without the mentioning of John Williams. What a wonderful job once again with the classic score of this film, which I would say is better than the first score. Its truly amazing how music can create such emotion so powerful that only the goosebumps on my arms can describe it. There is simply not enough words in the vocabulary that can truly capture its meaning. Not to mention the people working at ILM. They are the magicians in film. Film is visual effects, the two interconnect with each other, and without the visuals there is no film, and the visual effects have significantly improved since the first film and are truly spectacular - a work of art, that really immerses you into the experience.There are so many more people to appreciate, during the making of this film, none more than George Lucas of course, but also Irvin Kershner. He has incredible vision. His level of passion for the franchise and the way in which he interpreted the film has won me over, to the point in which I would argue, Empire is the greatest film of the trilogy and the franchise, and that is not an easy feat to accomplish. Empire has laid foundations for future movie sequels in which many of them follow that same formula.Compelling narratives, dark tone, deep character developments, Empire has it all. I like it when films 'strangle you', you know really keep you into it, and Empire has done just that. There is no other film (apart from the first film) that has had such a profound impact on my life, and I'll forever appreciate the pioneers behind the scenes. It is a film of the ages, and a must watch. There is so much more to say about this film, but the rest is for you for you decide. 5/5!!!", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 3}, "heading": "When Everything Clicks", "date": "2022-08-10T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8422422", "sentiment score": [0.0024, 0.0105, 0.0547, 0.5051, 0.4272]}, {"content": "Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) face attack by the Imperial forces and its AT-AT walkers on the ice planet Hoth.

Darth Vader(physical: David Prowse, voice: James Earl Jones) continues his search for Skywalker and eventually finds the rebel base with the rebel forces forced to retreat and Luke is separated while Han and the others attempt to elude pursuit of the Empire. Luke travels to the Dagobah system at the direction of his deceased master Obi-Wan (Alec Guinness) and directs Luke to locate his former master Yoda. As Luke dives deeper into the teachings of the Jedi and The Force, Luke's friends will face a danger that will force Luke to make a choice that could lead him to the Dark Side and discover revelations that challenge everything he's learned.George Lucas had always planned to expand Star Wars even if the first film proved unsuccessful down to contracting author Alan Dean Foster who wrote the novelization of Star Wars to write a limited location sequel novel that could be adapted on a low budget released as Splinter of the Mind's Eye. When Star Wars broke Box Office Records, Lucas reappraised his approach to the sequel leaving the Foster adaptation as novel (which became a success in its own right and the start of the Expanded Universe) and proceeding to plan a much more ambitious sequel. Lucas having felt the strain of directing Star Wars opted to take a role as Executive Producer and instead handed the reins to Irvin Kershner. The script received a lot of input from multiple parties as Lucas had many different ideas on how to approach the subject of Luke's father (who was not yet the reveal we know), Luke's sister (also originally a new character), and expanded roles for the Galactic Emperor and other planets which weren't deemed feasible. The script was given multiple passes by several writers including notably Lawrence Kasdan who had impressed Lucas with his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark. Upon initial release some critics were mixed in the darker tone from the original film with some outright lambasting the film, but overtime The Empire Strikes Back has been re-evaluated as not just the best film in the series, but one of the best sequels of all time.From the movie's introduction, it makes it clear to the audience that while the destruction of the Death Star was a victory slowing the threat of the Empire, it didn't stop them as the Rebels are forced to hide on the desolate ice planet of Hoth while Vader searches the galaxy intent on finding Luke. The harshness of the ice world is a fantastic setup with its bitter and inhospitable cold serving as a nice counterpoint to the original desert planet we saw in Star Wars and gives us the feeling of a new and unfamiliar place we've not yet explored. The characters also feel like they've advanced with Luke Skywalker carrying a more hardened demeanor in contrast to the fresh faced youth we were introduced to him as and Han and Leia have both advanced with the two developing a relationship and Han having become less cynical and self-serving as a character. The movie keeps itself mostly pretty simple with Luke embarking on a journey of self-discovery with Jedi master Yoda voiced and puppeted by Frank Oz and the character is a solid mixture of quirky, weird, and wise that makes him a unique mentor figure for Luke to play off against. The action scenes have also been expanded upon with a larger scale and more ambitious effects with the Battle of Hoth sequence featuring some great computer assisted Stop Motion to bring to life walking battle tanks called \"Walkers\" that look amazing in motion as well as destruction. We also get Billy Dee Williams as Han's former friend Lando who plays the role with the same cocky swagger as Han but still gives his own spin on it and gets some good moments in the film as a character. Darth Vader remains a solid antagonist in the film with his menace dialed up as the primary antagonist this time around, but also some solid revelations that are now famous (you know what I'm talking about) and some terrific pitch black humor of Darth Vader \"promoting\" various officers to Admiral after the previous one failed him.The Empire Strikes Back is a great film in its own right and one of the best sequels of all time.

A new film was needed that would continue the story of the confrontation between a small army of rebels and an unshakable and gloomy Empire led by Darth Vader. The fans got such a movie.The very title reveals the essence of the upcoming conflict. The Empire and its Death Star had suffered a crushing defeat, which meant that a retaliatory strike was needed, a step that would make the rebels lose. And this film perfectly demonstrates how the stakes are rising in this legendary confrontation.The main characters have matured noticeably, they have grown up, become more serious. Their characters are perfectly shown in the events that surround them. It seems that the actions in the previous movie were like a starting point. Now each of the heroes chooses his own unique path. Luke Skywalker, as the main character, decides to become what he did not think a few years ago - a Jedi, a warrior of light, who once and for all must defeat evil in the person of Vader and Emperor Sidious, who is still flashing in the background. Obi-Wan Kenobi's self-sacrifice seems to have made him an adult overnight, made him feel indebted to this old teacher. And then Luke accepts this burden of fate, intending to fight to the last.Leia Organa and Han Solo are testing the strength of their fragile relationship so far, they do not want to give in to each other. All this happens against the background of the struggle with the imperial armies and a series of betrayals, when it turns out that friends can no longer be trusted. In the maelstrom of events, news comes under the finale, which is now fashionable to call a \"twist\". This is an event that turns out unexpectedly, something that turns the whole narrative upside down or vice versa. The history of Star Wars was probably one of the first to show this technique in the cinema. This is remembered for many years, and the play of the actors (those who saw it will understand which actor and what situation I'm talking about) amazes with its sincerity and literally makes the audience tremble from the discovery that happened.However, this seemingly gloomy picture is not devoid of positive interesting moments. Huge Wookiees, droids and ridiculous situations allow you to dilute this tragic story of one family.The creators of the picture skillfully use the technologies available at that time, which enable viewers to see and, most importantly, believe in the reality of those worlds that are shown to us on the screen. All this is flavored with excellent dialogues, colorful characters and a wonderful musical component. What the Imperial March that appeared here is worth, which for decades will become the personification of the yoke of evil, the approaching dangerous Darth Vader.The creators perfectly show several storylines and interactions between the characters at once. There is a love relationship, and the relationship between mentor and student, a test of friendly feelings. And each of the lines is successfully woven into the overall plot, makes you empathize and see yourself in these diverse characters, understand their motives, agree or not with their opinion.\"The Empire strikes back\" makes it possible to leave our native Land and go on an unprecedented journey, makes you throw away your earthly experiences, understand how much brighter and more dynamic life can be, because it is in a galaxy far, far away, where events happened a long time ago. Cinema will allow you to ask a lot of questions about the meaning of life, about relationships, about the world, which is not only black and white. The world is multifaceted, with its own complexities and ambiguity. And, most importantly, this film will encourage you to see the next one, the one that will complete the classic trilogy and finally put all the dots on the \"E\" for these heroes.9 out of 10.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "The Retaliatory move of Darth Vader and the Empire", "date": "2022-07-21T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8355176", "sentiment score": [0.0193, 0.1352, 0.3081, 0.4626, 0.0749]}, {"content": "Empire Strikes Back takes everything done by A New Hope and improves upon it and it's during these two hours we see the most development for our main characters. All the substantial characters go on a journey in this film where we see just what they'd fight for and why. But more on that later.At the start of ESB we see the rebels still under attack by the empire despite taking out the Death Star in the last film. The first act on Hoth is brilliant with such iconic images such as the AT-ATs crushing rebels underfoot. We also get to see our characters start to really build their bonds with each other as Han and Leia start their eventual romance as well as Han and Chewbacca carry On to be a dynamic duo. We also see Han start to show his true colours when he is the only one to take the journey to go and save Luke when he's stranded on the ice.The second act of the film sees Luke leave his friends to go and train with Yoda while Han, Leia and Chewbacca are on the run from the empire. While not a lot substantial happens with the trio, it's the scenes with Luke and Yoda that give us the important insight. We see that a once great Jedi Master is reduced to a hermit because he failed to stop Darth Vader and his master the emperor. These are important for the audience later when Luke goes to fight Vader as we see Luke has only had a few days worth of training compared to Yoda who studied for years.The final act comes to a head on Cloud City where Han is betrayed by his old friend Lando and sold out to the empire, laying the trap for Luke. This is also the part where Luke makes his decision of what means more to him: his friends or becoming a Jedi like his father. He chooses the former despite being told he isn't ready which leads to the duel on Bespin.The final duel between Luke and Vader is one that also has iconic moments and for good reason. We see that Vader doesn't try during this duel whereas Luke puts in all of his effort to defeat the dark lord echoing the point Yoda made earlier about Luke not being ready to face Vader and from the choreography we can clearly see this is the case. The climax of this duel results in Luke losing a hand and having his reality crushed around him as he learns that Vader is his father. This is a powerful reveal purely based on what it means to Luke, someone who has spent years wondering who his father was and then being told he was a great man and arguably the reason why Luke would want to become a Jedi. While you could argue him screaming \"NO\" is over the top, I love it due to the fact Luke sees his idol is in reality the epitome of evil.So what journeys are taken by our characters.Leia learns that she loves Han and wants to be with him, dropping her sassy and bossy nature when things turn dire to be vulnerable and confess her feelings to him.Luke discovers he's willing to drop all his ideas of being a Jedi and fight Vader due to his reckless nature to save the people who are his family by this point.Lando decides to put the people of cloud city first but then realises what a fatal error he makes and decides to save Han.Han goes through the best out of them all In my opinion where our rogue who can't wait to leave the rebellion decides to stay having found people who he cares for and have his back.Empire Strikes Back is a masterpiece and an iconic piece of cinema.

So, it goes without saying that no one knew what to expect.Written by George Lucas and directed by Irvin Kershner, Episode 5 takes place not too long after it's predecessor. The Rebellion is still fighting the Empire as they just barely manage to escape from another battle as Luke is sent to be trained by one of Obi-Wans former teachers, Yoda. Han, Leia and Chewbacca are on the run from the Empire and are forced to seek help from an old friend of Hans, Lando, as their ship is damaged.Meanwhile, Darth Vader is not only hunting for them but Luke as well. We see him go to great lengths to find them and eventually threatens Lando to turn them in.All the while, Luke finally finds Yoda and proceeds with his Jedi training. However, he senses the danger everyone is in and leaves Yoda to save them. During this time, Han is frozen and taken away and Lando helps Leia and Chewbacca escape. Luke arrives and duels with Darth Vader, not only losing the battle but discovering that Vader is indeed Anakin Skywalker, his father.The combination of Kershner and Lucas is one that I'm sure fans (myself included) wanted more often. This is not only the easiest Star Wars to follow but also the most down to earth. Kershner helps ground Lucas' broad imagination, making not only the settings more realistic but the characters more relatable.The story is expertly paced, leaving little to no filler within the film. Every moment matters, and none is wasted on needless visuals, something Lucas is notorious for.The characters are given unbelievable depth, with Darth Vader probably being the most intriguing. Even when not factoring in the prequels and recent season finale of Kenobi, Vader's presence and power is on another level when compared to Episode 4 and learning of his connection to Luke makes him even more interesting.I also love the love triangle between Luke, Han and Leia. Yes I know what the third film will reveal but it not only helps establish the dilemma between the three but it also makes their relationship appear stronger, especially with Han and Luke, as they still will do anything to help one another.The action is splendid. The effects still look tremendous and like I said before, they aren't just there to look cool, they help tell the story.The acting in this film is why I really wish Kershner was kept on for later films, including Episodes 2 and 3. He not only allows a lot more improvisation and leeway with the scripting but makes sure that each actor delivers their all with each take.So overall, this is the perfect Star Wars movie.

On the one hand, in terms of plot development and pacing it feels like a step back from A New Hope. Luke goes to train with Yoda, while his friends evade a Star Destroyer through the power of plot armor. Eventually he goes to save his friends.However, it does a few things exceptionally well:1. Expand the world building of the original film. A New Hope was largely a fairy tale story which could stand on its own. But Empire Strikes back grounds it in a believable universe. The death star is gone, but that barely made a dent in the power of the Empire. The nature of the force is expanded on. The emperor is introduced. Darth Vader isnt just some random bad guy anymore.2. Subverting expectations done right. Structurally, the Empire Strikes back is kind of an odd movie, and its even more unique in that it ends on a pretty dark note. Luke going to save his friends doesn't really work at all. He instead gets his hand chopped off, almost dies and needs their help. But this subversion doesn't just come out of nowhere like a The Last Jedi gotcha, it actually makes sense.3. The plot twist at the end is so well known that people dont really factor it in when reviewing the story 40 years later. But keeping it in mind, this really would be a shocking moment to anyone watching it the first time.Also, with a better director at the helm, Empire Strikes back has better dialogue (slightly, its still not great), better acting, and better cinematography. John Williams even steps it up a notch with the music.Overall, the somewhat weak plot development (it spends far too much time in asteroid fields, a cheesy romance, and training montages), still makes me think its a bit overrated.

It too was considered a one shot deal, just like any other movie. It too, like every other film, had to pass the big test at the box office first, before anything else could happen. As everyone knows, this George Lucas directed film, was a huge box office smash, becoming the highest grossing movie of all time. It still held the record in 1980, thus giving the green-light for Lucas to develop a trilogy of films. What makes Empire Strikes Back (1980), so good, is the fact that, the film is one of those bridge-films. It bridges the gap from the first film to the third film. Some number two films in a trilogy, are susceptible to taxing pacing, caused by the need to be a set-up for the big finale in the third film. If done correctly, the film can be a successful bridge-film, while still completing its goal of being an exciting entry in the trilogy. This film accomplishes the goal of being an exciting adventure, full of maturing characters and it comes with a more darker side to it. It also successfully bridges the gap to the third film, Return of the Jedi (1983). It creates major implications for the main cast of characters. It is a cliff-hanger of a story.George Lucas stepped aside as the director for this film, for director Irvin Kershner. Kershner creates a slick, exciting, action-packed adventure, full of dazzle, flare and artistry. It has one of the most incredible soundtracks ever, thanks to legendary composer John Williams. It is pure pleasure watching this film. It is the stuff of legends now. It is still hailed as being the best Star Wars movie ever. The film starts with the main cast together, but splits them up into two stories, that carries the film to the end, eventually bringing them together again, but with a price. The first sub-plot involves Luke (Mark Hamill), meeting the Muppet-like, Jedi master, Yoda (Frank Oz), who begins training Luke to be a Jedi. The other sub-plot involves Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), being chased by Darth Vader (Peter Mayhew/James Earl Jones) and enlisting the aid of Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), the leader of Cloud City.

That battle in this movie was so visually pleasing and was the climax of what had been building up in the previous 4 films. And of course, one of the most iconic dialogues of all time occurred when Vader tells says to Luke \"I am your Father\", which I can imagine was way more impactful at the time of release considering the prequels weren't made.This movie was also packed with many other amazing moments, including the dynamic between Han and Lando and the carbon-freezing of Han.

The film is near enough flawless.The positivesThis film is sort of historical mostly because it has one of the greatest twists in cinematic history and has an ending which no one saw coming. The film isn't about the rebels getting another win over the empire, it's about the heroes struggling and managing to survive in the end. It's an emotional ending that is really satisfying and gets you excited for the finale. The twist is something I won't spoil but I'll always remember the first time I saw this film and just being shocked to the core with what was said. The lightsaber fight is the heat of the entire Star Wars saga. It holds plenty of emotion and it's not a fight where \"Vader\" and \"Luke\" try to kill each-other. \"Vader\" is toying with \"Luke\" to show him the power of the dark side. To try and show how powerful he can become. The characters are well written. Mostly with \"Luke\". He fails so much in the film. He gives up sometimes but he always tries again later. He has no fear too. He does not hesitate to face \"Vader\" when he has a vision. His arc also teaches us to be patient. We can't rush into things all the time no matter how much we want to do the thing we're trying to do. His teachings with \"Yoda\" also teach the audience in some ways. Lessons of patience and not letting your emotions get the better of you are told brilliantly. The acting is great too. Everyone does a better job in this film. The romance that develops between \"Han\" and \"Leia\" is charming. It's not awkward, the dialogue is great and the chemistry between the actors is great. The special effects look better than the first film. Thankfully \"George\" knew this was a great film that didn't need changing much. So we still see a lot of the original effects. Finally, the film is also incredibly funny. So many of the jokes and funny lines are placed perfectly. They don't interfere with the emotional moments and they bring some light hearted moments to an all round sad film.The negativesThe only slight negative I have is that the film isn't laced amazingly. It feels slightly longer than it's runtime. But it's only a small negative that doesn't affect the rating.Conclusion\"The Empire strikes back\" is near enough a perfect movie.

Empire Strikes Back takes everything that was good about A New Hope and just completely expands upon it. It is arguably the greatest sequel in cinematic history.Each character is given more emotional depth including Luke, Leia, Han, and even Vader this time. A New Hope is a fun movie, this movie feels more like an emotional experience in comparison. This is the first film in which the Imperial March, one of the best songs created for a movie ever is heard. Also, this movie contains probably the most shocking reveal in all of cinematic history.The sets are more grand, the effects are more spectacular, and the music is absolutely some of the best in all of Star Wars. The film sets genuinely feel completely real. From Hoth to Dagobah to Bespin the locations in this film are so incredibly detailed and well made. Dagobah especially feels like a completely different planet. None of the sets even feel like sets. They feel like real places. Also the special effects are marvelous especially for its time. The asteroid belt scene in particular is not only breathtaking to see but the music mixed in as well makes it so much fun to watch.Which brings me to the action. Much more fun and much more grand in comparison to A New Hope. The opening Hoth battle is such a great scene not only because of the special effects and the captivating action but also because of the stakes. The fact that we are following all the characters and they are all doing something makes it feel like they are actually in trouble and it makes for an engrossing scene. The fight with Luke and Vader is also a great action scene. The scene where Luke is looking for his friends and runs into Vader. The lack of music, the choreography, and all the colors work together to tell the story. One of the best set ups to a fight, like ever. The fight itself is very emotional for both characters which leads up to the big reveal at the end. Luke willingly chose death over joining Vader. It's a cliffhanger, literally.I feel like the Yoda stuff is shorter than it should be. Don't get me wrong I think the training scenes with Yoda on Dagobah are great. But, it feels too short and almost underwhelming. It starts off very funny when we meet Yoda, I love that scene after Luke crashes. I also think the dialogue between Yoda and Luke as well as Yoda and Ben is really well written. Yoda feels like a goofball at first, but quickly begins to come out as a genuine and wise character. All of those scenes are extremely quotable as well like Yoda says some really smart things. In the end it feels like Lukes training is extremely rushed and I understand it's because he chose to leave, but still I would have liked to see more. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate the scenes we did get. The tie fighter scene is awesome and I think about Yoda's quotes to Luke on a daily basis.Overall, The Empire Strikes Back is honestly a masterpiece of cinema. It is one of the best movies ever made without a doubt. The characters all have so much more depth to them. It completely steps it up in comparison to A New Hope. In terms of the character development, special effects, script, and execution. There is never a dull moment, and it is filled with iconic moments. The whole third act is so emotionally powerful. The scene where they lose Han, and then the Vader and Luke scene afterwards. Such well shot, emotional and beautifully filmed scenes. It ends with one of the best cliffhangers ever. Everyone is on a low note, and no one knows what's gonna happen next. The Empire Strikes Back is nothing shy of a masterpiece. *chefs kiss*I like New Hope better because it's much more simple and fun.

It marked an early peak for the franchise and unfortunately it all went down hill from here (with some minor spikes later on).I genuinely have difficulty finding things wrong with this film, even in the special edition versions. The pacing is slower, yet more methodical and introspective. The character work is more well done, and the acting has gone up a couple notches.This is also the film that made Darth Vader iconic. Though Star Wars was his first appearance, he had much more screen time here and was much more of a threat. Of course there is the infamous \"No, I am your father\" twist that changed our perspective of the events of both this film and the previous one.There was a genuine effort to continue and expand the story and setting of this universe. This movie is not interested with fan-pandering and retreading the same water, but breaking new ground and the result is a different, but superior sequel.The Empire Strikes Back is a darker and more mature film than its predecessor. There is less hopeful triumph and more loss and consequences. There is less black and white and much more grey. It continued the simple plot of the original, but made it just a bit more complicated and a lot more interesting.The best part of Star Wars was its structure and pacing, whereas Empire's greatest strength is its character work and themes.I should also mention that this was the film that introduced Yoda and further explained what the Force really is. That vague, poetic description that he gave was all we really needed. It was a plot device that enriched the mythos of the franchise.Luke, the main character was good in the original, but like most aspects of this film, he is expanded upon and improved as a result. His struggle is with his own impulsiveness and over reliance on strength and power, which is what he needs to work on if he is to become a true Jedi. He deliberately goes against the wishes of his master to save his friends, but fails and loses a hand as a result. He learns the truth that neither Obi-Wan, nor Yoda ever told him, which gives their actions and words (or the lack thereof) a different meaning in this context.The Jedi masters are not without their flaws after all.The Empire Strikes Back is a movie about facing the consequences for your actions, whether they be good or evil. It is realistic and grounded in that sense. It presents the audience with a story about struggle and failure and is not afraid to shy away from the more difficult aspects of life personified in this filmIf I said much more about Empire, I would consider it an essay so I should wrap up. As a whole, this movie is incredible and thought provoking. There is not a single bad or tedious moment in this movie and hits all the right beats.

The premise of the film sees Luke Skywalker travel to the planet Dagobah and learn from a Jedi Master in order to improve his skills, while Leia, Han, Chewbacca & C-3PO are on the run from The Empire with Darth Vader in charge of everything.Main Character\nThere is sometimes some criticism of Mark Hamill's performance in the first two Star Wars films because he does complain and wine quite a bit. However, I think this helps make this character feel interesting to me, the other two jedi's we meet in the first two films in Obi-Wan & Yoda are very wise and all knowing so easy to respect but hard to relate to. Luke is us the audience, we don't understand the teachings of the Jedi and we get frustrated easily, Luke makes mistakes as a character which makes him easier to root for as he feels very human compared to these other characters who feel like gods. This film does a great job in making Luke flawed but also making us care about him and want to see him succeed in his mission despite these flaws.Supporting Characters\nAs mentioned in my previous review Harrison Ford as Han Solo & Carrie Fish as Leia are brilliant supporting characters and they are great in this film together. They have so much charisma and there chemistry together is off the charts (probably due to real life chemistry), they have some of the most iconic scenes in film history together in this film and there romance really evolves in the film and feels very natural and appropriate for the two characters on screen. Now onto possibly the star of the show the character of Darth Vader, in A New Hope we are given a brief introduction to Vader but in this film he is centre stage and he is the embodiment of pure evil in this film. He is menacing and you are scared of his power as we aren't really shown that in the previous film, he is very commanding and you learn more about his character that makes him even more interesting then he was in the previous film. Frank Oz voices Yoda in the film and he was a great addition to the film, you can really see how wise Yoda is as a character and I really liked his dynamic with Luke in the film as you see two people pretty much at different points of life and how they treat things which leads to them clashing. Billy Dee Williams plays Lando Carrissian, a smuggler that are heroes meet and he also has loads of charisma and charm to him even though you can tell he maybe isn't as honest as he lets on and like Han from the previosu film he has his own motivations to help the team.Story\nThis film takes risks with its story by splitting the characters up into two different storylines but it really pays off. You have the slower but really interesting personal story with Luke & Yoda and you have the faster more exciting romantic story involving Han & Leia. They both mesh incredibly well and they both give an audience member different things to enjoy and it allows the pacing to feel perfect and well done. Obviously this film has some twists in it that are very well known but I wn't mention them specifically in case there is somebody who doesn't know about it, but it is all handled perfectly and really adds drama to this film but also the future films aswell that was pretty revolutionary at the time and even holds up now even though I know the twists.Script\nThe script for this film is so well written, the dialogue makes the characters feel so real and the drama is amped up in this one to truly make you care about the characters and the plight that they are in. The humour is good too especially with Han & Leia as it fits there characters perfectly and feels right for them and their romance. Also the twists are perfectly handled and written brilliantly to allow you to really sink them in and understand them.Style\nThis film's style is darker then A New Hope but it feels right as the heroes are plunged into a darker story and as the title of the film suggests the villains are all over them from very early on. In terms of action scenes The Battle of Hoth at the beginning of the film is one of my favourite battles not just in Star Wars history but in film history. Also the lightsaber battle between Vader & Luke is faster and just as personal as the one between Vader & Obi-Wan making it more exciting and a much better watch. Also John Williams score is even better in this film and really adds to the suspense and the darker story that is being told. I should also mention that I watched the newer Blu Ray version but unlike A New Hope the changes are very small and I actually thought they were fine and didn't change the film one bit.Overall\nOverall, I literally struggle to find any faults with this movie. It is the perfect middle part of a trilogy and should be watched as that so watch A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back & Return Of The Jedi in a short time frame to truly appreciate the development of the characters and the story. With this being my favourite film of all time I heavily recommend this film and the other two films in the trilogy.Rating - 10/10.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 4, "votes": 4}, "heading": "My Favourite Film Ever", "date": "2021-12-12T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7639689", "sentiment score": [0.0022, 0.0134, 0.1414, 0.6685, 0.1745]}, {"content": "I love this movie so incredibly much it's so nostalgic for me watching it as a kid but even excluding that this movie is an apsalute gem giving us tonnes of memorable characters and lines that have been so iconic.

What am I supposed to say? \"it's good, yeah\". It's one of the founding films that makes up my cultural mentality. I've been watching it for most of the 40 years that I've been alive. Anyway... let's put something down.The destruction of the Death Star did not signal the end of the war against the Empire. From an Ice Station on the planet Hoth, the rebel command structure is operating, but the Empires probe droids have found them, and an attack is imminent. Han Solo (Harrison Ford) delays again paying off his debt to Jabba The Hutt to remain part of the struggle but his escape from Hoth does not go well, and leads to a fateful meeting on Bespin. Luke (Mark Hamill) is told to visit the Dagobah system, to find a reclusive Jedi Master for further training.It's the dark cool one, isn't it. That's why we like \"Empire\". There's no happy ending, things are much worse at the end that they are at the beginning, but they knew the third one was coming to put it right. I can't imagine what it was like to hear the twist for the first time. It's now, of course, one of the most quoted (misquoted) lines in the history of cinema and an Iconic moment, but then it must have been quite the stunning moment.The visual effects are still pretty solid. I suspect I was watching another version of it that Lucas tinkered with in '97 and maybe even again after. I wish Disney Plus had the option for you to choose which version of the film you wanted to watch, but that's not the case yet.I'm going to stop writing, as I doubt most people will read this, let alone decide whether or not to watch \"Empire\" based on it but, on the off chance you're still here, it's good yeah!", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Hoth and bothered.", "date": "2021-12-03T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7611225", "sentiment score": [0.0541, 0.2326, 0.3557, 0.3072, 0.0503]}, {"content": "This is the pinnacle of all Star Wars. The only SW film which is truly great, at least in my opinion. Let's first talk about the story.

It also became a much better crafted, much more engaging adventure with some incredible high-spirited sequences such as the asteroid chase scene which is the finest action scene here. Lando is solid but not too memorable and Boba Fett is entirely forgettable and overrated, but the part with Han and Leia is still excellent and very well done.But of course the highlight is Luke's storyline. It is the greatest Jedi storyline so far and the one which is emotional and also stupendously well told with great dialogue. I loved that swamp planet and it was a perfect location for Luke's training. And of course the fight with Vader is unforgettable, the twist remains great to this day and the ending is an excellent tease for the sequel.

In fact it seems to pretty much be the favourite of all of the Star Wars films, probably because there is so much happening, and also because of the big reveal at the end. In fact, the big reveal was kept so secret that only Mark Hammil, James Earl Jones, and the creators knew about it, which was why it was such a shock.In a way this film pretty much feels like it is the middle part of the trilogy, particularly since the end isn't really all that conclusive. In fact, it sort of feels more like a phyrric victory, though the fact that Han Solo has been captured, the Empire hasn't really suffered a defeat, and that the film closes with Luke and Leah simply standing on the deck looking out at the rebel fleet is a clear indication that there is more to come.Yet, I felt that this was the best ending of any of the Star Wars films, though it is probably the only one that could get away with it. The first one had to have a fairly conclusive ending, namely because there wasn't really much indication that there would be any more after that, and of course Return of the Jedi had to be conclusive because there was no indication that there was going to be any more after that either (the latest trilogy came about after Disney had purchased the franchise).I guess the thing that I loved about the film is that there is so much action, from the battle on the ice planet of Hoth, to the asteroid chase. In fact, the asteroid chase is probably the best of any film that I have ever seen - there isn't many space opera's that I've seen that happen to have a full blown chase through an asteroid belt. Yet there are some nice touches as well, particularly the commander that keels over and dies, and the holographic connection cuts out when his ship is hit by an asteroid. Oh, and the Emperor is also revealed in this film - in fact I'm not entirely sure whether he was even mentioned in the first film, though I probably should have paid a bit more attention when I watched it a couple of weeks previously.Honestly, there is little that I can probably say that hasn't already been said, and since this film seriously has a huge cult following, or at least the series does, then no doubt this is one of the films that pretty much everybody has seen, or at least everybody who has wanted to see this film has basically seen this film. The other interesting thing is that it didn't seem to be as altered as the previous film was, but as I have indicated previously, these films really didn't need to be altered since they were good enough as is.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "The Best of the Franchise", "date": "2021-09-19T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7358842", "sentiment score": [0.0076, 0.0265, 0.0938, 0.5824, 0.2897]}, {"content": "Straight up, this movie is just so enjoyable to watch. I couldn't tell you the amount of quotable moments or movie influence this film has had at the time of its release. The characters, as if they weren't good enough already, are thrown into completely different scenarios to what they were presented with in 'A New Hope', and it's because of that, we as the audience only grow to love them more. Han Solo's character in this film has changed significantly from the last film, and we are now presented with this half rebel, half scoundrel character that is trying to become a better person and leave his life of smuggling behind, only for him to be chased by the galactic empire across the galaxy alongside Leia, Chewbacca and C-3PO. Luke skywalker begins training to become a Jedi, but still has this reckless trait about him that ultimately leads to his defeat in an impulsive and deadly duel against Darth Vader, who reveals to Luke in one of the most memorable parts of the movie that he is Luke's father. Combined with breathtaking special effects and immersive storytelling, this film has risen to become one of the most influential films of all time, inspiring captivating and exciting storytelling and giving birth to the modern cliffhanger ending that many blockbuster films utilise to this very day.

After all this time, it's still one of the best Star Wars movies to date and the best of the original trilogy.The opening Hoth sequence is extremely tense, dramatic, well-paced, and explosive. The cold environment works as a great way to show how much darker and grim this film is going to be. Luke's training with Yoda on Dagobah is awe-inspiring and this subplot has a ton of character development. We learn much more about the force and what it truly means to be a Jedi, Luke's character flaws are explored, and we get more hints and Obi-Wan and Vader's past. The Empire chasing the Millennium Falcon is intense and suspenseful. Darth Vader's fearsome presence and brutal executions give chills. Lando's betrayal and Han being frozen in Carbonite is impactful. Vader and Luke's lightsaber duel is one of the finest, most brutal and nail-biting fights in all of Star Wars, and Vader's reveal that he is Luke's father is powerful. The entire movie is an immensely thrilling and entertaining ride.All of the performances are top notch, and so is the character development and dialogue. We get to see Luke learning how to become a Jedi and a deep exploration of his character flaws, Han and Leia fall in love (while Han continues to be his awesome witty self), Leia opens herself up to relationships, and Vader gets a lot more screentime in this one. We see more of how ruthless, passionate, hateful, terrifying, and selfish he is, all of which make him such a great Sith, but also a small bit of his softer side at the end when he speaks with Luke through the force, foreshadowing his change in Return of the Jedi. We are also introduced to Yoda, who is an inspiring and unique mentor figure, and the puppet used to portray him has aged quite well in it's execution.Speaking of which, like the entire original trilogy, the special effects are stunning and groundbreaking, with lots of astounding practical sets, puppets, animatronics and miniatures and gorgeous green screen and matte shots (though in terms of the latter two, these haven't aged the best, but they were top notch for their time). And finally, John Williams continues to outdo himself with the amazing, exhilarating musical score.

Then there are the special effects and the sets that, obviously, were made in a time when making them was a much harder process than in the twenty-first century, but they look real. All this physical material ages well. Even the \"special editions\" are not an obstacle.The plot is structured in a different way than the one from three years earlier. It does not have that clear line between the loud and the quiet parts of the story. Different things are not placed far from one another. They are numerous and aren't given as much room to breathe as the last time. The overall tone of the picture is, apparently, the reason for many to regard \"Episode V\" as the best in the whole franchise. It is dark and bold for a mainstream movie, which isn't something you often find.Still, there are things to criticize, like the battle on the ice planet. Of course, it is beautiful, but the design of the imperial walking machines, as menacing as it may look, makes no sense. They are big, clumsy and slow. Then there is the plot itself. We have this huge imperial fleet of colossal starships with great firepower chasing one little rebel ship because the person in charge of that fleet wants to get their hands on one particular rebel person. Of course, the prior movie is proof enough of how important that one young rebel fighter is, but still, how about the rest of the rebel fleet? The movie has it in the beginning and at the very end. For the most part it is ignored. Of course, one can say that this isn't exactly science fiction, which is correct.

As every true geek knows, George Lucas liked the book \"The Hero with a Thousand Faces\" by Joseph Campbell so much that he incorporated many influences from it into the Star Wars script. Campbell studied myths and religions from around the world and he realized that there is a story that is repeated insistently in many cultures because it seems to convey a very important knowledge about the human soul. It is what has been called the \"Hero's Journey\" or \"Monomyth\". So Lucas wrote the Star Wars script following the steps of this mythical story.Luke enters the Death Star, just as Theseus entered the labyrinth of the Minotaur (a labyrinth that could well symbolize the intricacies of the human mind). When Luke finally confronts the \"dragon\" Darth Vader, he discovers that he is his father, and Luke is afraid that Vader's evil could also potentially be inside him. If his father fell into the dark side, perhaps he could do so as well. Thus, for example, Siegfried became cursed after killing the dragon Fafnir, because he kept the ring of power that the beast kept in his cave. The Hero's Journey is, in short, an inner psychological travel to learn more about the good and the bad within a person. The Jedi are so skilled in this self-knowledge and their wisdom about the force is so great that they can have premonitions about the future. That is, because they know themselves very well, they also believe they know what other individuals in the universe are like, so they will be able to predict their future behaviors. The failure that seems to me to have the Monomyth, and thus the Star Wars saga, is that a man, by introspection, can know himself, but not those who are different of him. It is very unlikely that a moral human being can predict the behavior of a psychopath who has no conscience and feels no remorse when he commits perverse acts. On the contrary, this technique can lead him to make fatal mistakes in predicting the future behavior of individuals who are psychopaths. A person capable of empathy will hardly understand the personality of a conscienceless egoist who only seeks his own interest, regardless of the people he has to destroy to achieve it. So the jedi have a more complicated job than they think to know all the sith and predict their selfish and evil future moves. Is Luke as similar to his father as he seems to think? Could he go from being a defender of freedom to becoming an evil galactic dictator? Or is he so different from his father that he would be incapable of join the dark side? Probably only a genetic expert could answer these questions.There is no doubt that we should enjoy the impressive visual spectacle that George Lucas has created with his galactic saga, but I think we should always keep in mind that the Monomyth has a very weak point and is not the answer to all the questions about the human being. Introspection is useful for a person to understand himself, but not to understand those who are different. Believing the opposite, can be a very dangerous thing. So it seems to me that the jedi and George Lucas need to consider that knowing the galaxy and the people who live in it is much more complicated than they assume. Some sith can be far more cold-hearted and villainous than a good jedi can imagine.", "rating": 6, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Star Wars, the Monomyth of Joseph Campbell and the psychopaths.", "date": "2021-07-07T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7100618", "sentiment score": [0.121, 0.3831, 0.2623, 0.1944, 0.0391]}, {"content": "This film is absolutely incredible if you have not seen this movie your insane 41 years still holds up as one of the greatest films of all time.Yoda is a great add to the franchise and you have the most shocking reveal of all time (spoilers!!!) darth Vader telling Luke he is his father.... mind blown when I first saw and the action and special effects are so much better.When I first saw this movie I was like aw man there splitting up the team the film is not going to work and then it did a fantastic job doing soBest sequel of all time no question this how you do a sequel that lives up to the expectations.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Sorry Lucas this film is the best in the franchise", "date": "2021-07-06T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7097318", "sentiment score": [0.0227, 0.0202, 0.0214, 0.0957, 0.84]}, {"content": "There's literally nothing I can say that's not already been said.

So as I watched The Empire Strikes Back, I was actually really disappointed. Because of how much people speak about it, I was expecting it to be something more than that. But as I grew up, I started appreciating it more and more. Why I hated it earlier and why I like it now, I'll explain it further in the review.Back when I saw this movie for the first time, I was getting more and more surprised at every scene. I had heard about all the characters like Yoda, Darth Vader, Han Solo, Chewbacca, R2D2, C3PO etc, but I didn't know what was their deal. I did know Yoda was a green guy who was very skilled, but I didn't know anything else about him. This is the reason why I liked his introduction so much. The problem was, however, that I already knew he was Yoda. So all that acting, I wasn't going to buy it.Similarly the Darth Vader scene was a huge bummer. The way people used to describe it was as if he removes his mask and says it with an emotional background music. But instead he just simply speaks it out in a claustrophobic environment, with the background music completely quenching the impact. It was in no way as good as everyone described it. I might have liked the scene if I didn't already know about it, which basically shows how this movie suffered from the success it received.The camera quality has also aged very poorly. I don't know why, but somehow I just can't watch old movies. I get bored and start feeling sleepy very quickly. It happened as I watched Episode IV, it happened as I watched Superman and it happened as I watched The Godfather. I actually slept at the part where Luke is training on Yoda's planet. This is the first movie ever that I watched in two different days. Once as I slept and once after I woke up the next day. And somehow it left such an impact that even today I feel sleepy whenever I watch any Star Wars movie.With all the bad things said, now let's move on to why I like this movie now. First of all the whole idea of a space opera is so awesome. I have always been very much into astronomy since I was a kid so an entire movie series made around this is something like a dream for me. I can imagine this could also be true for many kids in the 60's and 70's. The CGI is quite awesome for the time. Like I said about the Darth Vader scene or the Yoda scene, they must have looked so cool when they were seen for the first time. The part where Han is embossed rises too much tension, since he's such a likeable character and now he's at stake. If George Lucas went by his multiple movies idea instead of a franchise then this could have been such an awesome take.I feel really mad at myself that I learnt about all the spoilers from this movie except for Han getting embossed. I wish I could rewatch this after having removed everything I know from my memory. This movie should be re-released in 4K HDR so that I don't fall asleep while watching it again. It is a pinnacle in the Star Wars series and I really hope the franchise can return back to this level.", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 6}, "heading": "I will remove a star each time a toxic fan marks my review unhelpful, and increase one if they mark my review helpful", "date": "2021-06-30T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7077702", "sentiment score": [0.0869, 0.351, 0.289, 0.2023, 0.0708]}, {"content": "The stakes are super high, it's super fast pace, the duel in the end is Well made and looks beatifull, the soundtrack is one of the best things John Williams have made.

So much of pop culture changed once Star Wars came out it was insane, from toys, magazine articles, music, media coverage, video games (eventually), and dance clubs (disco was huge).Three years later came Empire Strikes Back and while it was a better film (imo) it wasn't as loved (by critics and movie goers though less by critics) it was still amazing. Out of the three films, Empire has clearly aged the best and has become probably the fan favorite of all the films (including the prequels/sequels). There isn't much I can add to the long debate and what has already been said, but I can add another voice to the discussion surrounding Empire.The biggest reveal that Empire brought was the revelation surrounding Darth Vader and Luke but for those seeing it for the first time today it will have little impact as it will probably already be known. Even so, Empire offers so much more than Star Wars had including bigger battles, Lando, Boba Fett & bounty hunters, better Darth Vader outfit, Luke learning about the force/introduction to Yoda, and Darth Vader being in charge. The tone of Empire was also much darker though today's audiences will probably not agree as other films under the Star Wars label will be more so.Overall, Empire Strikes back offers so much more than Star Wars and even some of the other films but for those of us who saw Star Wars in 1977 nothing will beat the experience of the original though Empire will always be my favorite.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "The Best of the Saga", "date": "2021-06-22T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7053282", "sentiment score": [0.0046, 0.0305, 0.1683, 0.621, 0.1756]}, {"content": "Watched as part of a Star Wars Marathon, hence the shorter review.This is it.

The Empire are also at their most menacing after the events of the previous film where the Death Star was destroyed and are hunting down the Rebels. This chapter also continues the journey of young Luke Skywalker to become a Jedi.We start on the ice and snowy planet Hoth where Luke encounters a Wampa who captures him and ties him upside down in order to eat him. The gang are concerned and Han goes out looking for the missing Luke. Here we get to witness a glimpse of the Force and the \"ghost\" Force of Obi-Wan-Kenobi. Once Luke is rescued and taken back to the Rebel base, the planet is under threat by the Empire and soon a battle commences with the Rebels fighting with the Imperial AT-AT Walkers. The Walker machines themselves are so creatively made and give the extra punch to the battle.This film soon splits up the heroes where Luke and R2 travel to a distant swamp planet so Luke can receive further Jedi training from Master Yoda. The problem is, Yoda does not want to teach him how to become a Jedi, since he finds Luke extremely impatient and can sense Luke's anger similar to his father Anakin. Obi Wan tries to change Yoda's mind, but only when Luke promises to really gives his best, Yoda accepts the challenge. The training sequence with Luke and Master Yoda were excellent and epic. One of the greatest lines in the series are found in this film given by Yoda, \"do or do not, there is no try.\"The Degobah set is just one of the best sets ever. It looks like a real environment. It's dirty, slimy and foggy and makes you wonder why Yoda would ever want to live there in the first place. Luke has this dark vision of himself battling Vader, which is a vision of the future that might happen and kills Vader and sees himself in the helmet, just before it explodes.Meanwhile, Han, Leia, Chewie and C3PO are on the run and with the Falcon's hyperdrive broken, they are chased by the Empire's Tie Fighter. The gang are also trying to escape Imperial battleships and use different manoeuvres including flying through asteroid fields. We see Han's pilot capabilities including hiding in one of the asteroid rocks which happened to be a giant alien creature's stomach. Han Solo and Princess Leia maintain the personalities that they developed in New Hope and we get to see a love/hate relationship between the two of them, where neither one of them wants to admit their feelings for the other. This romantic subplot is characterized perfectly and both actors have the chemistry to show their feelings for each other grow more and more as the film progresses.Darth Vader is defs badass evil in this film which can be demonstrated with his lack of patience for failure among his fleet. Yeppp the scene where he force chokes those who fail him one after the other. He promotes an imperial guard to a higher rank and there's just this look of fear on this guard's face.So manyyyy things happen in this film, we get see Lando Calrissian, a smuggler who is looking after the people on Cloud City and an old acquaintance of Solo and Chewie. We get to see Bobba Fett and Vader together, we see the Emperor in a Hologram talking to Darth Vader and towards the end of the film we have the startling revelations which reveals the origins of young Skywalker. The scene when Solo is about to be carbon frozen and we see Leia taking the chance to let emotions go with providing cheesy romantic moment by saying 'I love you' just before Han is lowered into the freezing chamber, and he saves the moment by responding, \"I know\"....chillss...typical Han Solo way.The movie from start to end was mind blowing, the direction is creative, the characters feel real, the nature of the Force is explored more without losing its mysticism and the pacing is fast and more intense than its predecessor. Darker and more mature with great effects for an 80's movie, appealing characters and lots of spellbinding action. The storyline is tighter, and goes much deeper into character development. The performances are terrific, especially by Harrison Ford and Billy Dee Williams. The scenes between Luke and Yoda are just timeless along with the lightsabre duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, which is truly one of the most suspenseful and dramatic scenes in the entire saga.

Most say Return of the Jedi because of its climactic ending, and although I can't argue with them at all, my pick is Empire Strikes Back.This movie accurately conveys the power the Empire has over the Rebellion and the many daring and courageous feats the Rebellion must be forced to go through in order to achieve not just victory, but survival. The acting again in this movie is second to no other space drama, very mature and makes you feel the realism in the story. The battles depicted are somewhat futile for the rebels as you feel throughout the story that the mighty Empire is just closing in on our beloved characters, culminating in the loss of Han and Luke's hand.The maturity continues in the relationships between Han and Leia, Luke and Yoda and Darth Vader. The comical love/hate relationship Han and Leia have blossoms into this yearning Leia has for Han to be more and this yearning for Han for Leia to love him for who he is. It becomes evident that although they don't share their feelings for each, there is a connection there that builds into a longing to see them together. The master and the student relationship between Yoda and Luke builds on the teachings of Obi-Wan and the Luke's recklessness as all students at one point or another show. And finally the relationship between Darth Vader and the viewer. Whereas once you found yourself hating this figure, cheering and laughing watching him helplessly corkscrew off into space after Han saves Luke during Luke's Death Star run, to cringing at his ugly, scarred head in his chamber, you suddenly found yourself intrigued at the cliffhanger this movie leaves you in. He is evil personified, but suddenly flawed and you find yourself wondering what will become of him.It's such a dark movie. The good guy doesn't win here. There is no celebration at the end. It leaves you in agony. For me, having to wait another 3 years to find out what will become of everyone. Will or Can the rebels really win? By the end of this movie, I wasn't really sure.Enough can't be said about the soundtrack for the movie. The way John Williams made you feel with the different themes used and the background of each scene. You felt the Imperial Walkers in the music. The swashbuckling sounds of the Millenium Falcon in the asteroid field. Darth Vader's theme expresses that military might that only a superpower can embody and Yoda's theme makes you feel and understand the spirituality of the Force. All brilliantly wrapped up in the main theme and expressed beautifully in the end credits.This is my favorite Star Wars movie of all time. I can't say that Jedi isn't a close second, but the way this movie made me feel way back when and the edge of my seat longing for the 3rd movie to tell me what the hell will happen to everybody will always make me feel that this was without a doubt the best sequel of all time.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "The Best Star Wars Movie Of All Time", "date": "2021-04-23T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6841537", "sentiment score": [0.0052, 0.0308, 0.146, 0.6271, 0.1908]}, {"content": "I saw \"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back\" in the the theater.

I think the overall character line up of this film was nearly as good as A New Hope, as whilst Obi-Wan still made some appearances he wasn't in this nowhere near as much as A New Hope, though Yoda in this film makes up for that a lot. The lightsaber duel between Vader and Luke in this was much more better than the duel between Obi-Wan and Vader in A New Hope so it's definitely far better than a New Hope on that. This film has many great parts such as the Dagobah part and some of the spaceship parts in this (particularly the asteroid field part) were pretty entertaining.The romance in this movie had a lot of emotion and chemistry in it, The romance added another ark to the tension between Han and Luke as they were both competing for Leia's affection so I found that quite interesting and complex. Overall this film is the 5th best Star Wars movie for me and the 71st best film for me.A lot of people put this film first or second on their list of best Star Wars films but I feel a lot of people do that because they watched Star Wars saga for the first time in non-chronological order and instead by release date which would make that big reveal at the end more memorable and emotional for them. The problem with rating a movie based on shock value is because the shock or surprises a film has only really does that on the first viewing so yes if you watched Empire Strikes Back before the Prequels then that scene would be very shocking but I don't tend to include shock value in my rating as a lot of people watch a film more than once. Besides I think watching the films in chronological order (starting with TPM) is better and more shocking, seeing Anakin become Vader, chopping Windu's hand off, as a person who watched the Prequels before the Originals I think that scene was more shocking on first viewing than what it would be if I had watched the bit where Vader reveals he's Luke's father in Empire Strikes Back before the Prequels.The first 30-35 minutes of this film were somewhat boring for me, there just wasn't much interesting complex things happening all it was was Vader simply finding the Rebel's secret base on Hoth and most of it was just mindless boring basic action involving a spaceship battle (though the bit with the yeti like monster and some lines Han said were quite good). The rest of the film though is what makes this film truly great. The Empire Strikes Back is also the only Original trilogy film which has bits of truly great scenery as I really liked the look of Cloud City, the rest of the scenery though (with a mild exception for Dagobah) was pretty drab and dull I think.The Vader scenes where Vader seemed to be hesitant to violently face his son and tried his best to convince the Emperor to spare him I felt were pretty interesting and emotional. I also really liked the bits where Obi-Wan and Yoda are hesitant to train Luke because they see too much of Anakin in Luke which I felt was a great way to really connect Luke and Anakin and I always felt that Yoda probably wouldn't have accepted Luke being further trained in the force if Yoda and Obi-Wan weren't so desperate to defeat the Emperor.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "A masterpiece after the first 35 minutes", "date": "2021-03-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6675085", "sentiment score": [0.0024, 0.0106, 0.0784, 0.6408, 0.2679]}, {"content": "This is the greatest most exciting Star Wars movie ever.

It was until 10 years later when i was 17 years old, that i was visiting my grandparents for the day and i decided to watch some cable, I came across a star wars marathon, it happened to be the final battle of Ep 1, where Darth maul fights Quigon and kenobi, i was spellbound. I was blown away by star wars that i didn't change the channel and i decided to watch the rest of the 6 movie saga in one night. My life was forever changed that day. Recently I decided to have a star wars marathon, and give an up to date review of the 6 movies.The Story: After the destruction of the death star, the empire is determined to find and destroy the rebellion, and Darth vader has special interest in finding Luke skywalker, to turn him to the dark side. After an extraordinary battle on the ice planet of hoth, the rebellion are now on the run, with Han, Leia and chewbacca being mercilessily chased by the empire. Meanwhile Luke is told by the ghost of his old mentor, ben kenobi to travel to an obscure planet to find an ancient jedi master named Yoda, to complete his training as a jedi knight. Despite yodas best efforts, luke is still not ready, which complicates things, when his friends are captured by the empire, and he decides to go rescue them, defying yoda and kenobis advice. What proceeds, is the most impactful confrontation in all of fiction. With luke having a lightsaber duel with Darth vader, and ending with vader revealing that he is lukes long lost father. If there is a person alive who doesn't know this spoiler than i would be surprised, even i knew about the\" I Am Your father \" way before watching it, but i will say every time i see it i am amazed and shocked by this impressive plot twistThe Characters: Luke is far more mature in this movie, but can still be reckless, despite his efforts to be trained by yoda, he chooses to save his friends over his much needed training, and is handed his ass by vader, which humbles luke and puts him back on the path to being a powerful jedi with experience. Darth vader is also given a lot of development in this film, instead of being the faceless big bad, we understand he is a servant to an even greater evil, but we are reminded that vader is ruthless and not to be trusted, which is what makes his reveal to luke seem questionable. Despite this you can feel his disappointment when luke refuses to join him, and that he is not the emotionless monster we all believed him to be. The rejection of his own son could have very well awakened anakin within him, and in fact it is luke that creates the potential for vaders redemption. Han is shown to be just as smug as ever, as he tries to gain the affection of leia throughout the movie, but it is his love for his friends and leia that make him so much more than a scruffy looking nerf herder. Leia is quite aggressive in this movie, mostly towards Han, but that could be because she has repressed feelings for him, that she doesnt not want to acknowledge since it might bring down her authority, but as we all know love makes you stronger. lando Calrissian has to be the smoothest talker in this galaxy, and despite his betrayal, he is still likeable, which is why its a relief when he helps the heroes in the end. Boba Fett doesn't have many lines, but his mere presence is spine tingling, and being the first Mandalorian on screen is quite impressive. Yoda is goofy and cute at first, he then makes the transition to the wise grandmaster of the jedi we know and love, never once is the illusion shattered for me, by his puppetry work, instead i believe he is a living breathing creature.The Action: The battle of hoth is quite impressive, with the walkers, space fighters, and ground troops all creating an amazing action sequence that is both energetic and immersive. The millennium Falcon chase, can seem quite long, but there is so much done with it, such as going through an asteroid field, that it contributes to the adventure aspect of the film. While the lightsaber fight is not as energetic or as spectacular as the ones seen in the prequels or clone wars tv show, this fight is still well choreographed, with vader also using a lot of force powers during the fight, as well as a lot of suspense being included with Luke being hopelessly outclassed. All the effects from the creature to the lightsabers, are highly better in this movie than the first, and it really makes you feel that this is a real galaxy.The legacy: This is without a doubt the best star wars movie that not only gives the audience a good dose of action, adventure, romance, and wonder, it is also the movie that defined star wars. Yoda educating luke about the force is both profound and engrossing, and is probably what helps lead to the grand expanded universe of star wars that makes it one of the most unique works of science fiction ever. Allowing star wars to be so much more than just the movies, and why it affects so many people, past, present, and future. The training scenes with yoda are compelling, the action is enthralling, the romance between Han and leia is great, the build up of luke and vaders confrontation is full of tension, and the reveal always leaves me in awe. This movie will forever be timeless and touch everyone's heart who see's it.

Episode 5 was proven to not be the worst episode and instead, was rather flattered by the critics, gaining 94% on Rotten Tomatoes and 8.7/10 on IMDb. The ensemble cast is carried over from The first film released 3 years before Episode 5, 'A New Hope' and produces a thrilling encounter of the Rebellion' resurrection. It is evident that the titles are almost back and forth for the Rebellion's sake, whenever a title is in their favour, the next Episode pushes them back. It has been 3 years since the destruction of the Death Star and the Rebel Alliance, led by Princess Leia, has set up a new base on the ice planet Hoth, a desolate, low-temperature, snow-blizzard land. The Imperial fleet, led by merciless Darth Vader, hunts for the new Rebel base by dispatching probe droids across the Galaxy. Luke Skywalker, struggling to control himself in the cold, is captured by a wampa while investigating one such probe. He finds himself tied up, hanging from above in a dark cage, the newly named Jedi is able to escape by using the Force and his lightsaber. Before Luke succumbs to hypothermia, the Force spirit of his deceased mentor, Obi Wan Kenobi, instructs him to go to the swamp planet Dagobah to train under Jedi Master Yoda. Han Solo discovers Luke and keeps him alive by keeping him under the body fat of his dead Tauntaun mount, and the two are rescued by a search party the following morning. Luke as clearly matured in the three years he has been present in the Rebellion, and he see his character develop throughout. Being more independent, wiser and learning to take matters into his own hands, moulding into the Jedi that Obi Wan formerly was. The probe alerts the Imperial fleet to the Rebel's location . The Empire launches a large-scale attack using AT-AT walkers to capture the base, it was admitted that scenes featuring the large walkers took the longest to film, reasoning their slow and lethargic movements. The Rebels manage to evacuate, Han and Leia escape with C-3PO and Chewbacca on the Millennium Falcon, but the ship's hyperdrive malfunctions. They hide in an asteroid field, where Han and Leia grow closer amidst the tensions, the pair seem to attract quite easily to one another. Several Bounty Hunters, summoned by Vader, assist in searching for the the Falcon. Meanwhile, Luke travels with R2-D2 in his X-Wing to Dagobah where he crash-lands in the middle of an eerie swamp. The X-Wing used by Luke is named AA-59 and is a T-65B model. The star fighter is armoured with 4 laser cannons, 2 proton torpedo launchers and 6 proton torpedoes (crucial in the act of destroying the Death Star), weighing 110kg its class 1 hyperdrive rating allows it to be extremely flexible, fitting into narrow spaces. Luke meets with a diminutive creature whilst first plays with young Skywalker, joking around him and confusing him with his distinctive speech. He later reveals himself as Yoda, who reluctantly accepts Luke as his apprentice after conferring with Obi Wan's spirit. We visualise for the first time, the wise Jedi legend Yoda, who appears unique in his aspects. His small frame supports him as a Jedi, with his low space tee of gravity proving for good balance. His wrinkled face is deceiving to the Sith at first, but inside him is a ruthless nature. His wisdom of the Force is beyond any other Jedi, his experience manifests this. The character itself is a puppet, performed by Frank Oz who also supplies his voice, Oz is also the puppeteer behind the famous Miss Piggy, from 'The Muppets'. Luke learns more about the force from Yoda, who lifts his X-Wing out of the swamp using the power of the Force. After evading the Imperial fleet, Han's group travels to the floating Cloud City on the planet Bespin, which is governed by Han's old friend Lando Calrissian. Bounty Hunter Boba Fett, son of Jango, tracks the Falcon and, with Vader, forces Lando to hand the group over to the Empire. Boba is similar to Jango apart from his improved suit design, he aims to continue his father's legacy as a Bounty Hunter, and has a personal hatred toward the Jedi, following Jango's decapitation from Mace Windu. Vader plans to use the group as bait to lure Luke, intending to capture him and turn him to the dark side of the Force. Luke experiences a premonition of Han and Leia in pain, Yoda explains to him the importance of patience and that learning the ways of the Force takes time to master, against his and Obi Wan's wishes, Luke abandons his training to rescue them. Vader intends to hold Luke in suspended animation by imprisoning him in carbonate, selecting Han to be frozen as trial experiment, this, much to Chewbacca's discontent, taking his anger out on Lando. Han survives the process and is given to Fett, who plans to collect a bounty on him from Jabba the Hutt. The term Bounty Hunter originates from South Africa, coming from the search for HMS Bounty, the famous ship captained by William Bligh that mutinies in April 1789. This could infer to Boba Fett's armour, embodying the traditional South African colours of green and yellow. Lando, still loyal to Han, frees Leia and Chewbacca, but they are too late to stop Fett from departing with Solo. Under attack from numerous stormtroopers, they fight their way back to the Falcon and flee the city. Meanwhile, Luke arrives and engages Vader in a tense lightsaber duel that leads them to the city's central air shaft, Vader appearing more defensive than offensive. Vader severs Luke's right arm, significant as the same happened to Anakin when in combat with Dooku. After Darth Vader disarms the young Jedi, he tempts him to embrace his anger and join the Dark side of the Force. Luke reiterates Obi Wan's telling, accusing the Sith Lord of murdering his father, metaphorically speaking that is true. Vader reveals that he is Luke's father, in 'four words' best known to the film. Horrified, Luke drops into the air shaft and is ejected beneath the floating city, hanging from an antenna. In a mixture of mental states, he reaches out telepathically to Leia, who senses him and persuades Lando and Chewy to turn back. After Luke is brought aboard, they are chased by TIE fighters towards Vader on his Star Destroyer and finds out that the Falcon's hyperdrive has been tampered with, but the confident, intelligent droid R2-D2 reactivates it, allowing them to escape. Luke rejoins the Rebel fleet and his severed hand is replaced with a robotic prosthesis, just like his father's previously. Lando and Chewbacca begin their quest to save Han, as the other Rebels watch in unison as the Falcon departs. Episode 5 sees the first confrontation of Luke and his father, Darth Vader and makes for an exciting next chapter to how he, being the only accessible Jedi left, will go about defeating the evil Sith Lord. Leia and Han's relationship expands in the screenplay, but of course is cut short due to Vader's experiment involving the pilot. This situation isn't resolved in the film and supplies a strong costarring base for the next chapter. An incredibly directed film, shows the Rebel alliance growing stronger and replacing the former 'Republic', allowing it to compete with the Galactic Empire. Vader's truth is out and just like Palpatine, his quest to turn Luke to the Dark Side, is his priority.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Film Poetry", "date": "2021-01-25T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6527228", "sentiment score": [0.0478, 0.2907, 0.4516, 0.1961, 0.0138]}, {"content": "One of the best movies that i saw.

Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca, C-3PO, and R2-D2 are stationed on a rebel base on the snowy planet of Hoth - filmed on the blizzardous glaciers of Norway. But after the Galactic Empire attacks the base, everyone must flea.Han, Chewy, the Princess, and CPO all engage in a gripping chase across the galaxy that leads them through an asteroid field and into Cloud City on the planet Bespin. Here we meet Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), Han's old smuggler friend and a new addition to the franchise's iconic gang.Meanwhile, Luke and R2 head for a swampy planet on the Dagobah System, searching for Yoda - the Jedi who once trained Obi-Wan. Rather than being a human, though, Yoda is a two-foot tall green alien being. He speaks out of order and carries a quirky kind of sagacity that is nonsensical at first, but latently brilliant.Yoda is one of the most convincing cinematic puppets to date. Make up artist Stuart Freeborn designed him and Sesame Street veteran Frank Oz brings him to life with faultless movement and an iconic voice. The character is a pure manifestation of how \"The Empire Strikes Back\" ups the ante from its predecessor. In this movie, we get one of the wisest characters in film history, and he comes in the form of groundbreaking special effects.Beyond the heartwarming Yoda, \"Empire\" also offers audiences vaster images of the galaxy. In addition to Norway's glaciers, all set pieces are captivating throughout. From Yoda's swamp to Lando's city, every world has its own authentic energy. Moreover, the space scenes have improved from \"A New Hope\". With greater visual effects, the ships can be captured doing more spectacular stunts through the cosmos.The plot thickens from a character perspective as well. The love triangle between Luke, Han, and Leia grows more intense and the villainous Darth Vader becomes all the more interesting as we get our first glimpse at the Emperor himself through a hologram.We also learn a little something about Luke's family history that (even though the movie came out forty years ago and it is now the most referenced plot twist in popular culture) I will abstain from revealing here.There are countless other reasons that fans consistently point to \"The Empire Strikes Back\" as the best Star Wars movie to date. It is the first movie to feature Boba Fett; the first time we see the Force move an object without touching it; there is the Wampa yeti monster; the first light saber duel not to feature two old guys; and one of the most famous lines in movie history... again, I'm not spoiling anything...Much of the dialogue is a step up from the original, actually. This might have something to do with the fact that Lawrence Kasdan wrote the screenplay's final draft rather than George Lucas. The creator of Star Wars, Lucas served as executive producer on \"Empire,\" but gave directorial reigns to Irvin Kershner.Because \"A New Hope\" has seniority on its side, \"The Empire Strikes Back\" cannot match the original's influence on cinema as a whole.

Star Wars Episode IV was a mega blockbuster and the one of the most acclaimed film at its time so people kept very high expectations from the sequel. Logically, it was almost impossible to bring a sequel to such a high acclaimed film especially when you have to make it keeping in mind that you have to match the predecessor and also generate excitement for the next part. Then, Luacs Films brought The Empire Strikes Back and stunned the Star Wars fans again. A New Hope had sort of slow start because it had to introduce the characters but Episode V had an advantage that all the main characters were known so it begun on a blasting note. No further slow start, it begins directly with the explosions and does not stop it till the end. It was far more entertaining and less darker than the predecessor therefore enjoyment factors took over the show throughout the narrative. Empire Strikes introduced some interesting characters like Lando and Yoda yet it remained frontloaded. Harrison Ford looks so cute in this film, the additional humour in his character is Lovable. I loved seeing him flirting with the Princess. Oh my god, how gorgeous Carrie Fisher was looking as Leia but i didn't like the characterisation. She was supposed to have a solid sense of love but actually she was like you know fumbling, i mean she kissed Luke to make Han feel Jealous then confessed her love to Han and then she was fondly behaving with Luke again. Of course, we got the answers in the Sequel (Return Of The Jedi) but still it didn't make much sense here.

Whatever has been said about this film already deserves to be repeated, because this film should and will stand throughout the ages.So many characters within this film that return from the original or are introduced for the first time are all-time fan favourites; Yoda, Boba Fett, the Emperor, Lando, Bossk, etc. The score is as magnificent and memorable as it can be, particularly the badass Imperial March that has become synonymous with evil. In the first film, the themes of hope and rebellion were strong and crowd-pleasing, but here, the audience is given a cold yet brilliant splash of water in their faces as they realise that actually, the bad guys sometimes win as the morals and goals of the heroes become more challenged than ever.So many scenes throughout the film are bound to stick in the back of your mind and never leave you for as long as you live because of how unique, iconic and well-written they are, from the speeders lassoing the legs of the walkers during the Battle of Hoth, to Yoda giving us a glimpse of just what the Force can accomplish by telekinetically lifting Luke's X-Wing out of Dagobah's swamp, to Han flying the Millennium Falcon out of the belly and through the jaws of a gigantic space worm inhabiting the asteroid they had hidden on, and of course, Darth Vader dropping a bombshell on Luke in a twist that shocked the world that remains the greatest scene in the whole franchise - \"I am your father.\"The Empire Strikes Back is the reason so many people truly love Star Wars. It took a franchise already established to be filled with magic and improved it by creating a more mature and intriguing sequel that changed cinema as much as its predecessor. Nothing Disney or the saga's own creator has written since this film has been able to top this masterpiece and it seems like they never will. Whilst the first Star Wars (A New Hope) is the series' magnum opus (most important work), the Empire Strikes takes the throne and title as Star Wars at its greatest - a title that it has held undisputed ever since its release in 1980 and will most likely keep until the end of time.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "The Diamond Standard for Sci-Fi Epics", "date": "2020-10-22T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6195980", "sentiment score": [0.0068, 0.0153, 0.0366, 0.3423, 0.5989]}, {"content": "I could watch this many times and re-evaluate Luke Skywalker and Han Solo's character development.

There have been many different versions of \"The Empire Strikes Back\" released through the decades, and the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy is infamous in the fact that the original theatrical versions of the films are not widely available to the public. With this in mind, I believe that denoting which version of the film that I am watching to write this review should be taken into account. \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is the least altered of the original movies, with only a few very minor shots, special effects, and continuity changes made to the movie. It is commonly believed that this is because George Lucas had the least amount of involvement in the production of this one. I honestly don't mind any of the changes made to the second film at all: the continuity changes help bring the movie in line with other films in the franchise, and the updated special effects at Cloud City are nowhere near as jarring and annoying as the changes to Mos Eisley in the first movie, or Jabba's Palace in \"Return of the Jedi.\" That all being said, I would still prefer the option from Disney to watch whichever version of the movies that I want to watch. A special release similar to the \"Blade Runner\" box set would be nice.\"The Empire Strikes Back\" takes place some time after \"Star Wars\", as our heroes are all in hiding on the remote ice planet of Hoth. Darth Vader (David Prowse/James Earl Jones) is sending probes out to distant star systems to find the hidden Rebel base and to find Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), who the Emperor (Ian McDiarmid in this version, Clive Revill/Marjorie Eaton in the original) believes will be a powerful asset. After a battle between snow-speeders and AT-AT walkers on Hoth, Luke splits off from Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) to go to the planet Dagobah, where he will receive further Jedi training from Master Yoda (Frank Oz). Meanwhile, Han, Leia, Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) make a daring escape from the Empire through an asteroid field. They eventually wind up in Cloud City, which is governed by an old friend of Han's, the sly Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams).Everything from the original \"Star Wars\" is improved. The stakes are higher, the plot, pacing, and tone are all slimmed down and tightened. Mark Hamill gives a much better performance this time around, no longer being the annoying and whiny brat that he always seemed to be in the original to me. The single main villain this time, as opposed to having two villains in the first film (Tarkin and Vader), gives the movie a much better narrative focus. Vader is also much more interesting in this movie, too. He was little more than a henchman for Tarkin in the first, but this time his character is given some depth, and he also delivers one of the greatest plot twists in the history of cinema.The special effects in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" are yet another thing that Lucasfilm beefed up. Compare the Death Star attack in the first movie to the asteroid field scenes in the second. The use of puppets for tauntauns, asteroid monsters, and Yoda all still hold up well today, forty years after the release of the movie. The stop motion effects for the tauntauns are probably the only effects that have aged poorly, but they're actually pretty well obscured by the snowy environments of Hoth, and they're really only employed during long shots anyways.This is a personal favorite, and it's rightly regarded as one of the greatest sequels of all time. Most great sequels still often stand in the shadows of their predecessors. I can only think of three off the top of my head that completely blow the originals out of the water (\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\" and \"The Dark Knight\" being the other two). The entire original \"Star Wars\" trilogy is worth a watch for any movie fan. I can understand personal arguments for the preference of either of the other films, but one can't deny that \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is the most well-crafted film in the entire saga. It's quite a shame that both the prequel and sequel trilogies were not able to recapture the magic and cultural influence that the original group of movies did, which set a benchmark for action-adventure blockbuster cinema and inspired generations.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "The Greatest Fantasy of All Time", "date": "2020-09-18T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6103687", "sentiment score": [0.0508, 0.2353, 0.4427, 0.252, 0.0192]}, {"content": "Nearly everything about this film is perfect.

The Imperial March is one of the best pieces of music ever conceived.It goes in directions you don't expect. And I'm not just referring to the big twist. I'm also referring to how the movie ends at a low point as well as a cliffhanger.It leaves things up to your imagination. Like Luke's face in the mask.

It provided the audiences with a sweeping cinematic experience, as they experienced the galactic adventures alongside their iconic characters: Luke the Hero, Han the Renegade, Leia the Princess, Obi-Wan the Wise One, C-3P0 and RD-D2 the comedic duo. The characters were nothing more than archetypes, but this enhanced the immersive nature of the story, because the audience could see their own traits reflected in each character in a galaxy far far away...The Empire Strikes Back is the definitive sequel to Star Wars because it directly confronts the original's primary theme: Adventure. The Original was a film about desire; to long for more - to look out on the horizon. However, Empire is a film that's not about looking out, but looking in - the film has a stronger focus on the internal, rather than the external. Yoda is quick to remind not only Luke, but the audience, of this fact:\"All his life, as he looked away... to the future - to the horizon. Never his mind on where he was - what he was doing! Adventure! (Scoffs) Excitement! (Scoffs) A jedi craves not these things. You are reckless!\"And that's what I love about Empire, and that's why it's such a strong sequel - it directly confronts the prior film's ideas. The film dwells on the consequences of someone's narrow-minded pursuit of their wishful desires. Luke is not only burdened with responsibility and leadership, but he will face his ultimate enemy: Darth Vader. But what's so compelling about the two character's conflict is not the external conflict of Man vs Man, but the internal battle. When Luke enters the cave, he confronts his greatest fear. But his greatest fear isn't the man clad in a black cape approaching him, it's when Luke sees his own face in Vader's helmet. He's afraid that he'll follow Vader's path, and that's the internal conflict that propels the training scenes with Yoda.The duel between Luke and Vader is absolute perfection for many reasons: stunning cinematography, choreography and sound design. But those stylistic aspects are nothing without the internal substance. The duel is so enrapturing because of the internal, rather than the external. Luke holds an incredible determination to defeat Vader for many reasons: firstly, to prove that he can be triumphant over the dark side and to overcome his inner conflict. His second motivation however, is contradictory of his first: it is to kill Vader as an act of vengeance for Obi-Wan. This is why Luke chooses to try to kill Vader rather than trying to help him. Ironically, Luke's pursuit to vengeance would ultimately lead him down a path to the dark side - a path which is he so afraid to take, and hence, why he so desperately wants to triumph over Vader. This is why the \"I am your Father\" moment holds so much impact: Luke wanted to prove that he was different than Vader - to prove that he wouldn't be seduced by the dark side. However, his greatest fear had been realised: the man he so desperately wanted to be different from, is his father; an inextricable link that he must confront.As written above, one of the greatest strengths of Empire are the Characters. In this sequel, the characters are no longer labels or archetypes - they only go by their own name: Luke is no longer the Hero, Han is no longer the Renegade, Leia is no longer the Princess; but each are Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Leia Organa. The characters evolve beyond their rigid archetypes into the icons we know and love today. Han's character is shown to have surprising emotional depth, and the same can be said for Leia. Her mask of feistiness that she displayed in the first film is shattered in the sequel, as signs of emotional vulnerability are illuminated. Furthermore, I found the two character's romance to be brilliant, not just because of the chemistry between Ford and Fisher, but also because it brought great humanity to a story that was already abundant in it.The Empire Strikes Back is a phenomenal sequel, as it deals with the prior film's themes head-on: most notably, the theme of adventure. The film displays the consequences of one's wishful pursuit for adventure and tells the audience to focus not on what's out there waiting for them, but to focus on what's waiting inside for them. In addition to this, Empire greatly elevates the archetypal characters into fully-fledged humans; most notably the trio of Luke, Han and Leia. Moreover, the film also dwells on some thought-provoking material, which the prior film lacked in my opinion. What stimulated me intellectually were the intense internal struggles of Luke Skywalker, and his consistent conflict between Light and Dark, Good and Bad.

To develop the story for Empire Strikes Back, Lucas brought on sci-fi writer Leah Brackett to write the screenplay. In the first draft, Brackett would have Luke's father appear as a spirit to Luke thus tying into the backstory provided in A New Hope. Upon reading Leah's screenplay, George was less than pleased but before he could meet with her and fix the script, Brackett passed away thus leaving Lucas to write the next draft himself but he brought on Lawrence Kasden to reanalyze the screenplay. Unlike A New Hope, Lucas chose not to direct Empire Strikes Back because he was focused on running Lucasfilm as a business, overseeing the VFX company Industrial Light and Magic, and financing other Lucasfilm projects. George then offered the director's chair to his old film mentor, Irvin Kirschner. Known for more character-driven films like The Eyes of Laura Mars, Kirschner had never directed a blockbuster before and he originally rejected the offer, fearing the sequel wouldn't match the standard of the original film. When he called his agent, though, he later accepted the job at his agent's behest. Shooting for Empire Strikes Back began in Norway in early 1979 where they encountered the worst storm in 50 years with temperatures of -20 degrees and 18 feet of snow. On one occasion, the crew were unable to leave their hotel to shoot a scene of Luke escaping the Wampa cave so Irvin was able to achieve a shot involving Luke's exit of the Wampa cave by opening the hotel's doors and filming Mark Hamill running out into the snow while the crew remained warm inside. When the film opened in June of 1980, it did incredibly well at the box office and with moviegoers, but critics were mixed on the film, but over time, the film has been received far more positively and is now considered by many to be the best out of the entire Star Wars saga.In the annals of moviemaking, no film series has had as much of an impact on me and my love of film as George Lucas' epic sci-fi saga, Star Wars. Much like many other kids of my generation, I grew up thinking, dreaming, watching, and playing Star Wars. I watched the original trilogy on repeat and owned so much Star Wars merchandise at one point in my life that it became an obsession. When I was growing up, the second film in the original Star Wars trilogy, The Empire Strikes Back was never my favorite as I always preferred Return of the Jedi over it but in more recent years after watching the film more times when I even care to count, I began to see the film more for what it was and still is as over 40 years later, Empire Strikes Back is still a fantastic film and one of the few sequels that manage to be even better than their predecessors in terms of story, themes, and characters.The film opens with the Empire searching for the Rebels using probe droids. The Rebel Aillicene has fled to the ice planet Hoth as a result of the Empire's pursuit. While out on petrol, Jedi in training Luke Skywalker is ambushed by a Wampa. Back at Echo Base, Han Solo is worried that Luke hasn't returned so sets out to find him. Meanwhile, Luke is able to escape the Wampa's cave with the use of his lightsaber but soon succumbs to the frigid temperatures. Han eventually recuses Luke and takes him back to the base to recover. The Rebels are soon discovered by an Imperial probe droid and prepare to evacuate the base. The Empire launches an attack against the Rebel base using AT-AT walkers. Han, Leia, C-3PO, and Chewbacca manage to escape the base just in time onboard the Millenium Falcon but their hyperspace is malfunctioning as they are pursued by the Empire and flee into an asteroid field. Meanwhile, Luke and R2-D2 travel to the swamp planet Dagobah and encounters a small green creature who reveals himself to be the Jedi master Yoda. At first, Yoda feels Luke is too old to be trained as a Jedi but finally agrees to train him in the ways of the Force. Now, Luke must learn to master the Force while Leia and Han find themselves in love with one another as the Empire closes in around them.Star Wars: A New Hope has often been discussed to death in terms of the context of the late 70s, either as a political subtext of the Vietnam War, George Lucas' rank as an up-and-coming director alongside the likes of Coppola and Speilberg or even the way how the film shifted Hollywood's focus away from more low-key dramas to massive blockbuster films. Despite all that, it's often overlooked how dynamically The Empire Strikes Back is rooted in the conditions of the early 1980s. There're a lot of reasons for this but the most obvious one is that Return of the Jedi deliberately fled back to the trappings of A New Hope, right down to the choice to restage the Vietnam War with the Ewoks standing in for the Veit Cong. There's also a sense of in which the artistic markers of The Empire Strikes Back is far more subdued than those of A New Hope or even The Last Jedi.When viewed with a modern look, Empire Strikes Back seems to signal the arrival of the 1980s. Much like Terminator 2: Judgment Day or Spider-Man 2, it expands both the scoop and scale of the Star Wars universe but also pushes the saga forward in terms of story and characters. Even looking past the now quintessential unveilings of family ancestry and changing power aspects, The Empire Strikes Back redefined what a Star Wars film could be. It's no longer about steering though the just vagueness of an uncertain future or battling with the spirit of American might. It's instead about trekking through social power resources or finding your place in a vast universe. Much like Aliens, Predator or Die Hard, Empire Strikes Back feels like not only a classic 80s film but also, the first truly great 80s blockbuster.Admittedly, The Empire Strikes Back came out in May of 1980, a time of transition for America. Jimmy Carter was still the president but his grip was failing and in the spring of 1980, a new dawn was coming. The 70s had been a rough time for America as it dealt with the consequences of the Vietnam War and Watergate. It had dealt with an oil panic as well as an economic slowdown. The standard family unit was turned upside down as the rise of the two-income family left many kids somewhat unguarded and the increased devoice rate made it easier to dissolve the traditional nuclear family. It's not surprising that the 1970s saw a boom in the horror film genre that tapped into those fears.Star Wars: A New Hope want against that background with its idea of a used future where things were dirty, grimy, and beat-up and where there is no explanation on how technology works in this galaxy as things just happen with the flick of a switch. This idea, as opposed to a slick-looking future, seemed to connect with audiences in a country that was dealing with the injuring of their own idea of what dreams could be. Even the Darth Star seemed like an apocalyptic level threat, with the capacity to destroy an entire planet. The world for A New Hope appeared to be on the verge of falling apart with industrialized prisons on wheels, trash disposals crushing scrap iron in the depths of an intergalactic weapon of mass destruction as well as a washed-up smuggler and his beat-up ship.In contrast, the world of The Empire Strikes Back looks far more polished and shiny. The opening scene replaces the hot sands of Tatooine with the ice wastelands of Hoth. The industrialized surrounding of the Darth Star has been replaced by the regularly glossier and clearer interiors of Imperial Star Destroyers. There's no sign of an apocalyptic weapon of mass destruction, just the Imperial Fleet doing their business as they always do. Indeed, the opening crawl of The Empire Strikes Back proclaims that the Empire has already welcomed automation, leaving a lot of the Rebel hunting to probe droids. Even Darth Vader went though a redesign between A New Hope and Empire to make his costume look more smooth and polished. The shoulder pads are more noticeable, Vader's center respirator is more complicated, his eyes are black and glossy thus removing the red hue from A New Hope. At one point in the film, the viewer does get to see Vader without his helmet, thus showing he isn't a robot but an actual flesh-and-blood human. This fits perfectly with the massive artistic shift of the Empire within the film as a whole. In a New Hope, the character of Grand Moff Tarkin was portrayed as a commanding persona, having a characteristic figure and speaking with an ice-cold command whereas The Empire Strikes Back introduces us to several Imperial officers who feel like pencil-pushing minsters rather than men who evoke fear into their subordinates. Outside of Vader, Imperial officers seem exchangeable and ubiquitous. Admiral Piett somehow survives until Return of the Jedi mostly by keeping his head low to the ground but few viewers of the films would be able to pick him out of an Imperial line-up.In The Empire Strikes Back, the Empire seems to have become an organization specified by its middle-management. It's a massive and ungainly organization that exists to squeeze the galaxy into submission through the use of force and terror. In A New Hope, the Empire was portrayed as a planet-killing monster whereas Empire Strikes Back depicts them as a more controlled operation as Vader never issues orders to destroy Hoth or Bespin even though he does have the power to do so but rather threatens to bring them both to heel through sheer force. This shift in the characterization of the Empire in The Empire Strikes Back feels very much in tune with what was happening in the 80s as America progressed into the Reaga era. Much like the 70s, the 80s would be seen as a decade of excess and consumerism. This kind of fear was also perfectly captured", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "A sequel done right.", "date": "2020-08-28T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6036383", "sentiment score": [0.0305, 0.1222, 0.2521, 0.4593, 0.1359]}, {"content": "This is very dark.

Not only is it one of, or maybe even the best sequel ever made, but also one of the best movies of all time.Star Wars was a lighthearted adventure, full of memorable characters, groundbreaking special effects and conciously campy plot of a colorful group of heroes fighting an evil Empire led by a Dark Lord and prevailing at the end.The Empire Strikes Back sets itself apart from that right off the bat, when The Empire takes revenge for their loss, utterly crushing the Rebellion in an epic battle on the ice world of Hoth. Following a iconic battle with the Imperial Walkers, the rebels are forced to escape, Han Solo and Princess Leia in one way and Luke in another, hoping to find the legendary Jedi Master Yoda who can complete his training.Yoda himself is one of the main draws to the movie, he is such a fantastic character. Luke goes looking for a great and physically strong warrior, yet instead finds this miniature creature who has no physical skill or weapon provice at all, instead he complements it with his spiritual strength, showing that the force truly stands above such trivial matters. The puppet looks amazing and Frank Oz does a great job voicing him.We are also introduced to a nice twist in which we finds out that Darth Vader is not actually the true main villain, but merely a minion. We always knew there was an Emperor, but when his shadowy hologram appears for the first time, we learn that he uses the force, and that he was the one who converted Vader to the Dark Side in the first place.Then, of course, there is the climax, in which Luke fights Vader, seeking revenge for Ben Kenobi and his father, and in the end learning that Darth is actually his father. It truly stands as one of the great twists in cinematic history and turned the story completely upside down.Overall, the movie maintains the sense of lightheartedness and fun of the original, whilst making it more dark and complex. The character development, special effects and music are all amazing. Director Irvin Kershner truly nailed it in his follow-up to a legendary film.This is how you make a sequel to a movie without doubt!

I believe all the major story ideas and plot points of Empire came from Brackett's draft and were later adapted, by Kasdan, into the final screenplay. Had Brackett survived and continued working on Empire, it probably would have been even better.My first suspicion that Kasdan was a hack writer came many years ago after I, like everyone else, heard he had written Empire. I immediately checked Kasdan's filmography to see if there were any other notable films I had not yet seen. Unfortunately, the only other poignant movie written by Kasdan was Indiana Jones: Raiders Of The Lost Ark (for which George Lucas wrote the story). Kasdan also wrote the screenplay for ROTJ, and I personally think that ROTJ is both a cheap and poorly written film. ROTJ was my first clue that Kasdan may not have been responsible for the success and quality of Empire.Upon further research into the writing of Empire I eventually found Brackett's name buried in an article somewhere: Researching Brackett I noticed she had co-written the screenplay for \"The Big Sleep\" (1946) with Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. I remember watching all the major Bogart films in college and now, upon comparison to Empire, I see major similarities - especially in the romance and drama genres. This is also a big clue.Kasdan was able to skate by for many years without writing anything, allowing him to soak up the admiration for Empire without providing any body of work for comparison (besides ROTJ). Now that Kasdan's name has been plastered all over the media for the Disney Star Wars remakes we can now see that Kasdan has no real writing talent.I am happy to say that I know Lawrence Kasdan is not a good writer.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Leigh Brackett is what made this movie good, not Lawrence Kasdan.", "date": "2020-07-23T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5927815", "sentiment score": [0.0895, 0.24, 0.2765, 0.322, 0.0721]}, {"content": "The story of the rebellion against the Galactic Empire continues with Luke, Leia, Han, Chewie, R2 and 3PO on another blistering ride.The best praise I can give The Empire Strikes Back is that it was the first Star Wars movie to hold my 3 year old daughter's attention for the entire duration, and it's easy to see why as virtually every scene is a new and interesting story.Several great characters are introduced such as Yoda, Lando, Boba Fett, and the Emperor, who add further interest to the overarching story, while the original movies favourites of Han, Chewie, Leia, Luke, Darth Vader, and the droids continue to entertain.There are countless cinematic moments such as the Hoth planet scenes, the epic chemistry between Han and Leia, and virtually everything that happens on Degaba and in the Cloud City.

With A New Hope being a more light-hearted, but no less iconic, space opera this change puts more focus on the emotions of the characters we have met and, in turn, raises the stakes for heroes, especially Luke who must now face his foe.Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill maintain the effortless portrayal of their respective characters from the first film. The introduction of Billy Dee Williams as Lando is simply brilliant as he too fully embodies his role and bounces off Harrison Ford's Han Solo. Another introduction is that of Yoda (operated by Frank Oz) that adds to the mystery of 'The Jedi' and 'The Force' as this character is just overloaded with so much wisdom and is used so well to build Luke's character throughout the film.'Empire' contains possibly one of the most memorable line's in of all cinema; those who have seen this know exactly what I mean.

Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca & C3PO all manage to escape on the Millennium Falcon, but when Luke Skywalker gets a message from Ben Kenobi asking him to seek out the Jedi Knight Yoda (who will offer Luke the necessary guidance and training to defeat Darth Vader) Luke naturally obliges...A New Hope was a very good film, but when watching The Empire Strikes Back it always feels like you're watching a slightly more polished version of the original film; it is ever so slightly better in all departments; the pacing was one issue with A New Hope (which in fairness could be attributed to setting the story up) nonetheless The Empire Strikes Back is just that little bit more exciting, energetic and pacey. The Empire Strikes Back also ups the ante with the relationship between Leia and Han Solo (it was simmering in A New Hope, but it's a bit more volatile here). However, it's mostly played for laughs and Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher are both terrific here and are major players in making this picture fun. The whole skit between Yoda and Luke was also enjoyable (as well as being a clearly integral section of the plot).As the villain of the piece Darth Vader shines just that little bit more in this film - he was bad in A New Hope, but here we can really see that he is pure evil (effectively 'offing' members of his crew for failing in their duties). Once again the physical presence of David Prowse and the booming voice of James Earl Jones do a superb job in bringing out the best (or possibly worst) in Darth Vader.Interestingly George Lucas directed A New Hope, but elected to step out of the director's chair and allowed a more experienced director to direct his next film. In my opinion, this was probably a good move as Irvin Kershner does a better job in terms of scale and spectacle. I think in A New Hope Lucas was a bit too intricate and pernickety with the finer details of the story which made A New Hope feel a little elongated.I think Kershner could see Lucas' vision in this film and put this vision to the screen as best as he could and the results clearly speak for themselves.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 3}, "heading": "The force is stronger", "date": "2020-07-04T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5882224", "sentiment score": [0.0046, 0.0672, 0.4369, 0.4717, 0.0196]}, {"content": "Why does the Millennium Falcon fly straight towards Darth Vader's star destroyer after leaving Bespin?

It's poorly paced and at the end, only three or four scenes end up being important.The entire first act on Hoth is boring and insignificant. The pacing is way too slow considering that this is just the rebels' temporary hideout that is destroyed early on. This entire section of the movie contains so many scenes that are just bizarre in terms of why they're even included. Like when Luke Skywalker gets captured by a yeti for some reason and saves himself using the force despite not even knowing about the force. I honestly don't get why they even decided to drag out the section taking place on Hoth at all. The only reason it exists is to establish that the rebels set up a temporary base and had to leave when the empire attacked it. It would have made sense for that part to happen way earlier in the movie. And speaking of the part where the empire attacks the base on Hoth, the fight scene that takes place here is excruciating. It's dragged out way too much and the action is insanely repetitive. The entire thing is just planes flying around and shooting at big walking machines.The scenes with Luke being trained by Yoda are painfully uninteresting and while this is going on, the other characters are going through some forgettable scenes leading up to one of the dumbest parts of the movie: Han Solo getting captured. He literally just lets the bad guys freeze him in a block of metal, which is one of the laziest possible ways they could have set up this plot line to be resolved in the beginning of the next movie. After that there's some more fighting and the movie ends. That's basically everything notable that happens in this part of the movie.

A disappointing movie becomes an unholy dumpster fire and a solid sequel becomes an undisputed masterpiece. The Empire Strikes Back is certainly overrated. It's a great film, as are all the Star Wars movies (the six that count anyway), but Episode V is not a dramatic step up from A New Hope or any of the other films in the saga. The movie has become so overrated that many say it's not just the best Star Wars movie, but the only Star Wars movie that is any good at all. People are dumb. And I want to take the contrarian stance, but let's face facts, The Empire Strikes Back is a perfect sequel to the landmark movie event that was Star Wars. It deepens the mythology, lending George Lucas' world a gravity and psychological weight not seen in the buoyant original. It's also just as quirky and clunky as any other Star Wars film, so let us not rewrite history. TESB is a great film, a great Star Wars film, possibly the best of the six, but not the overwhelming triumph of the series that SO many people claim it to be.A change in director for a Star Wars film is not the world-shifting event many like to portray it as. George Lucas remained the architect of The Empire Strikes Back. Exhausted by the trials of shooting A New Hope, he hired Irvin Kershner to get his vision onto the screen. The result works, contrary to popular sentiment, because the style of the film doesn't deviate too harshly from Lucas' original. There is a movement in the fan community to credit Kershner as some kind of auteur that wrangled the saga's reigns from Lucas and envisioned it in his own way. That's hyperbolic nonsense. Kershner does a good, nay, great job with Lucas' material. He is a reliable professional, but not a genius that saved the series from its creator. It was Lucas, after all, who envisioned this story.The darkness of Empire is also a fan favorite element. There have been volumes of words written on the film's approach to the second-act trope of going darker and more weighty before an eventual triumphal finale. Empire adheres to this structure very well, eschewing a Hero's Journey for a cliffhanger, to-be-continued bummer of an ending. For some reason, this is really profound to lot of fans. Like a revolutionary idea that elevates the film to stratospheric levels. I've never gathered why darker, bad-guy-wins endings are considered any better than heroes-save-the-day endings. Just because they don't happen as often? Darkness is valued more than almost anything when it comes to blockbuster film buffs. Maybe it comes from some deep-seated embarrassment that you like a silly thing like Star Wars in the first place, and a darker film validates your love. \"See, it's dark, like a grown-up movie!\" I'm comfortable admitting that I prefer Star Wars as the kid-friendly space adventure it is, and while I can appreciate, and actually welcome the darker chapters, I feel no obligation to elevate them as worth \"more\" as films.That's all to say that Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back is a great movie. A perfect sequel, a terrific middle chapter in a terrific trilogy. However, the push to declare it as the undisputed pinnacle of the entire Star Wars project is frustrating. A New Hope is always going to be the most iconic, the most cherished, the film that will last forever. Revenge of the Sith still bests Empire for dramatic intensity and darkness. And personal tastes must dictate that any of the other movies in the saga could hold favor over it. Yet, The Empire Strikes Back still has some kind of stranglehold on the top spot of Star Wars films. It's the easy consensus pick. You can point to the fact that pesky Gorge is not credited as writer nor director (even though his influence superseded everyone else's), you can identify it's clear \"dark\" elements as evidence that the movie is \"more mature\", and you can also just go along with the herd and proclaim it as the best because that's what everyone says. The movie's reception really shouldn't bug me the way it does. I really love The Empire Strikes Back. I think I take issue with its overinflated sense of greatness because it comes at the expense of the other five films. Each one of George Lucas' six movies has a claim as someone's favorite. They are all of a very high level of blockbuster filmmaking.

The prize that eludes their grasp is not so much the rebel forces but a young man, Luke Skywalker, who has the potential to become a great leader, visionary and warrior; a jedi knight. While Skywalker trains to be a jedi his friends are captured and used as bait to lure him into a trap where he will be forced to choose whether he wants to join Vader's forces or die.The secret sauce of The Empire Strikes Back and what makes it infinitely better than Star Trek, is the jedi knight philosophy expressed by its master practitioner Yoda. It simply radiates wisdom and truth and resonates in our hearts. \"Do or do not,\" Yoda says \"there is no try.\" He warns against anger, fear and aggression which flow easy and are seductive. It is much better to ally yourself with the \"force\" and the life energy that surrounds and binds us. The romance between the characters of Han Solo and Princess Leia, and the acting of Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher that bring it to life, also makes a sad sack of the Star Trek franchise. Unfortunately, the romance is unbalanced and macho oriented, as well as PG rated. Still, it is more romance than a hundred Star Trek episodes put together.

As the director got the profits from the previous film, he was brave and put much of the money earned in the 1977 film, the production of The Empire Strikes Back. And here he was able to make an even better job. Amplifying all we had shown earlier and presenting new facts of great importance for the entire series of films in cinema, The Empire Strikes Back, even without a beginning and an end, is regarded by most fans as the best of all movies.Being the second film released and the fifth in chronological order, as George Lucas was the executive producer to focus better and have full control of the plot, and gave the synopsis for the screenwriters Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan could develop the plot. To not get overwhelmed, as before, Lucas entrusted the direction of the long Irvin Kershner, who happily held a job and raised even more irreproachable quality of the saga, confirming its success.It is a critical period for the Rebel forces. The adventure continues in this \"Star Wars\" sequel. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) face attack by the Imperial forces and its AT-AT walkers on the ice planet Hoth. While Han and Leia escape in the Millennium Falcon, Luke travels to Dagobah in search of Yoda. Only with the Jedi master's help will Luke survive when the dark side of the Force beckons him into the ultimate duel with Darth Vader (David Prowse).Mark Hamill returns to play Luke Skywalker and continues to play well the hero challenging, courageous and with enormous potential for the \"Force\". The actor shows the determination of the young man trying to become a Jedi, and seeks to defend his friends from the evil forces at any cost. Curious fact is that due to a serious accident of the actor just before the start of filming, which meant that he spent several surgeries and his face stayed a little different, George Lucas had to modify the beginning of the story, making Luke was attacked by a monster and had his face disfigured and rebuilt plastically.Harrison Ford back as Han Solo. Between the first and this second film, Ford has also been involved in classic praised Apocalypse Now (1979) Master Francis Ford Coppola. Carrie Fisher also back as Princess Leia Organa and earns a highlight even greater following. She empathizes with Ford, despite not knowing if you really want to be with Han or Luke. The cast is so mingled that the chemistry of the actress works well with both. Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca, Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, Kenny Baker as R2-D2 also return. Who appears well is Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian. Your participation and where you live is fundamental to the conduct of the climax of the plot. The Merchant of gas that can be seen at first glance, as a traitor to our protagonists, shows the course of the plot, that their participation is much more thorough. David Prowse with the body and James Earl Jones as Darth Vader voice still leaving threatening. His cruelty appears, for example, when you kill without hesitation a commander who failed a mission. We also see the Emperor Cos Palpatine (voiced by Clive Revill), which dictates the rules for Darth Vader and clarifies its importance only because the villain fear him.No wonder that this is regarded as the main movie of the saga. Is it that important and memorable events that generate consequences in this and the other films occur. Without \"The Empire Strikes Back\", we can say that the series would not have the same impact today in the minds of moviegoers. Among the main events is the fact that it was here that we hear so famous and world renowned Imperial March, Darth Vader is also seen as the authentic ruthless villain and not just as the commander of the imperial troops, the dear Master Yoda first appears emerging in more depth in philosophy Jedi when he starts training Luke to have mastery of the \"Force\" and not be susceptible to its \"dark side.\" Appointed as an extremely powerful in the previous film, we were surprised to see an old, softly speaking in funny rhymes and appears harmless but hides within itself a fascinating inner peace. Seeing him not imagine how powerful it is, but anyone who has seen the scanned version of Yoda in \"Attack of the Clones\" and \"Revenge of the Sith\" knows what he is capable; see the progress of the relationship and Solo Read, which at first was full of taunts with not wanting to reveal what they felt for each other and then at a crucial moment for him, end up revealing their feelings for one another, a kiss in the next episode would be revealed as \"Incestuous\"; see the tanks AT-AT. also arise Boba Fett and Lando Calrissian, is the first lightsaber showdown between Luke and Darth Vader, and still have the bombshell revelation that would shake the foundations of science fiction, narrowing the list of enemies and then would have a decisive role in the final Episode VI.George Lucas and his creative team, do not fall into temptation to sin by exaggeration and knew dosing masterfully adventure, action, romance, and science fiction. In the scenarios, the art direction of the trio Leslie Dilley, Harry Lange and Alan Tomkins, nominated for an Oscar for the work along with photography Peter Suschitzky worked precisely with a much wider variation of environments. If at first were introduced to the desert climate and abandonment of Tatooine, beyond the city, here George Lucas presents us with glaciers on the planet Hoth, meteor shower, the huge and well developed where Lando Calrissian and his people live in the City the Clouds, and swampy and gloomy planet Dagobah where Yoda. Without doubt, the new scenarios and photography from white snow to the darker tones of the final climax in Cloud City and Vader's ship, beyond the synopsis of the story itself that keeps the bad guys winning almost all the time, made this the darkest film of the series. Here, as the title suggests, nothing was easy for the Rebels.The special effects are even better than the first film. At the Battle of Hoth, for example, when the AT-AT appears, leave the audience puzzled. Animated in stop-motion with false (which never sounds fake) leave early in the film the feeling that we were facing a great movie. Following the persecution of the Millennium by the rain among asteroid, is very well done. The sequences in Cloud City, including the final climax, are tense, exciting and full of adrenaline. There are still scenes in the nave of Darth Vader and exciting and revealing fight between the villain and Luke. The battles are well choreographed and more realistic than before.The issue remains the same language for the entire series. Paul Hirsch and Marcia Lucas work giving an impressive agility and speed to chase scenes and the ships and the fight scenes especially. The transitions that give an atmosphere fades over TV series remains. John Williams returns once again in the composition of the soundtrack, so keeping track of signs and worshiped still presenting the Imperial March with several clever variations during the long. Again the track is in perfect harmony with the sound, every sound working independently without ever seeming contrived. No wonder that the sound along with the special effects have taken the Oscar deserved.The direction of Irvin Keshner takes us inside asteroids and planets around with incredible realism. Besides these scenes are worthy of applause battle on Hoth with AT-ATs and all sequences of intense action of this battle, the escape of the Millenium by asteroids, and the fight scenes and character development. specially the scene of the great revelation of Darth Vader to Luke is highly valued by management.

My poor mother had to decipher that description.Just as important as A New Hope was to movies, Empire Strikes Back is to sequels. And why? Because Lucas paid for this himself. No one has ever been in his position before. To make huge movies that are financed by the creator. No studio would ever allow a movie like this, it took risks: It's not a rehash, its darker, a realistic puppet was a serious main character and a lot of the story is left in the air.But while this movie is darker than it's predecessor it's not a dark movie, its just darker. People seem to forget that. It's a more serious story but it's still able to maintain the fun feel of 4. It also continues the speed from 4 as well. Instead of getting in huge fights they are just small scuffles. This doesn't feel for a second that it's trying to outdo the original. The story and the characters are expanded and deepened.Yoda was a huge risk, it's hard for us to think of a puppet not being taken seriously, but no one had ever attempted to make a life like puppet before. And sequels weren't a sure cash in either. In order for this movie to break even it had to be the most successful sequel of all time. It's these things that Lucas gave us. He not only knows how to tell a story and make a great movie but he takes risks to do it at the same time. He did this his whole career. If this movie failed not only was Star Wars dead but so was Lucas' career. That'll motivate you.My favorite SW set is in this, the carbon freezing chamber. I don't know if it's the steam, the orange light or the vastness but I love this room. Everyone looks cool here. Especially the Stormtroopers, their white really illuminates the orange well. And you get Vader and Boba in here too.The snow troopers are very cool. I can't figure out if I like them or the Episode 3 clones best.Lando is a great addition because he's the Han that could have been. And Lando gets crap for being bad but he really does make the best call. He appeases Vader to save his life while still giving himself the freedom to save Han in the end. And he hasn't seen Han in years maybe he's become a real , the last time he saw him he was a smuggler after all. And Billy Dee is great, I don't know if anyone is as effortlessly smooth as this guy.3P0 in pieces is a great addition that provides endless jokes.I love Han's love story with Leah because she's given him no indication that she's interested. And he acts like they have this dating history. But he is right because she does want him.And the best part of the movie: Yoda/training. Not only is Yoda the most powerful Jedi of all but you hang on his every word of wisdom. Lines repeated for my entire life. I have always loved the fact that the most powerful Jedi was the smallest. There's just something about that idea that really gets me.And there's really something to be said for the fact that Yoda is not actually real. We all know that Frank Oz did the voice and puppeteered Yoda but the fact that Yoda is not actually real really helps to make his character real. it's not necessarily Frank Oz as Yoda, what you see is the little green puppet as Yoda. There aren't pictures of him at studio 54 or news of him getting married. Yoda is Yoda. when he is not being the puppet on screen he doesn't exist which really helps to his reality.The biggest complaint since Lucas finished the saga was that \"I am your father,\" is now not a surprise any more. Which is true, you do know, but watching them in order you'll probably be surprised that Anakin turns to the dark side. And it might be a surprise that Vader tells Luke this because as far as we know Vader doesn't know who Luke is. He doesn't even know that he has a kid. And we think that Anakin is dead.

I know that most people consider Empire to be the best in the series, but I always found it to be the, for lack of a better phrasing, least appealing. Better than the spinoffs (Solo and Rogue One), which I mostly found to be unnecessary cash-grabs, but still last place in the nine movie lineup. I still love this movie, but there were some key factors that kept it in the lowest position.The biggest issue I had with it is that it had a massive amount of exposition. Don't get me wrong, the battle on Hoth was awesome, so was the fight between Luke and Vader, but everything else in the middle was pretty much a bunch of data dumping, where Luke is learning about the Force, and Han and Leia's relationship is developing while they hide and try to repair the Millennium Falcon. And while I do think that things like world building, character growth, and relationship development are important, when your story is primarily that, it's going to suffer in my opinion.Now, as a kid, I had severe ADHD and a very short attention span, so all the stuff in between the exciting action sequences made it very hard for the movie to hold my interest. For me it was like: What's happening with Luke? Oh, he's still learning about the Force. Ok, what's happening with Han and Leia? Oh, they're still hiding and fixing the Falcon while getting closer. What's happening with Vader? Oh, he's still looking for the Falcon. Ok, lets get back to Luke. Oh, he's still learning about the Force. Rinse and repeat for again and again for over an hour. For a kid like me with a very sort attention span, it was very hard for all this to hold my interest. And sure, they had little tidbits like the giant asteroid worm, but it wasn't enough to hold my attention for long. There was also the cliffhanger ending regarding Han's fate, which my childhood self did not appreciate and was very upset about. Even what was arguably the greatest movie twist in history left no impact on me thanks to my own father, who told me that Darth Vader was Luke's father back when I watched A New Hope for the first time; something I will never forgive him for.Now that I'm older, I definitely have a deeper appreciation and understanding for this movie than I did as a kid, and scenes that I once considered to be boring I now find much more appealing, but the damage was done from numerous re-watches over the years from when I was a kid.

The gulf between good and bad, the black and white of youth and innocence has been riped apart in a moment of time and all that is left are the shades of grey. \"You killed my father\" shouts Luke as he battles Darth Vader \"no Luke Skywalker\" he replies \"I am your Father\" So the enemy is not with out, but within.The Empire Strikes Back is the second film in what will probably, since Disney has no intention of slowing down, become the longest running serial in film history. Serial here is the key world, not that Star Wars was originally coincided as such by it's director, although Lucas had his hopes and lots of ideas on paper. The original film was thought to be a risky one off or so the studio thought. Only a hint towards the end of the production that success and a sequel could be at hand saved Darth Vader from being blown up like a firework by the Millennium Falcon. Lucas might have hoped that Star Wars would be such a success that he would be given a chance to make another but to keep making them and to make nothing else was beyond even his imagination.The concept behind Star Wars, how it worked in Lucas' own imagination, is that Star Wars would be rather like a Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers serial. These were made of a number of individual episodes about 20 minuets long with each one ending with a cliff hanger and starting with a miraculous escape. The plotting was sometimes so desperately week the show just about managed to scrape along from one end to another. They were cheap to produce ( although Flash Gorden was the most expensive of them all) and aimed at young children and the Saturday morning picture show. They were made quickly with out to much thought and with sets and music borrowed from other films. Put together by people who were ether glad of the work or would have wished themselves else where. They where rich in corn and low in production vales, totally lacking in pretension and made on the the understanding that every thing in it was disposable and forgettable. Of course no child of any age has ever forgotten a single moment of every episode and certainly made an impression on Lucas. The original Star Wars film was only pretending to be a weekly episode some where in the middle, (episode 4 actually) in a run of films. So that at the start you are immediately thrown into the action. What has come before is related on the now very famous script that scrawls sharply away from the picture frame just as it did at the start of each successive episode of Flash Gorden. the screen wipes and the general air of pulp fiction in Star Wars comes from the serials as well. Like many American film makers of his generation, Lucas was creating a future world by reliving his past.But The Empire Strikes Back really is a midway episode. Dropping you directly into the action with the attack on the ice planet. our band of heroes divide into two groups and take two separate story ark's to Dagobah and the cloud city, allowing the film to play off one against the other and introduce new characters in each story line, before winding back them back together for the finale at which point the film oddly just comes to a stop, with every one backed away from the camera and looking out of the window, with out even a cliff hanger ending, the only unresolved situation is having Han Solo encased in carbon with his fate unknown. Perhaps Lucas just lost his nerve about copying the old serials but couldn't work the story up a dramatic full stop, so things just hang in the air and then the titles role\nThe Empire Strikes back has some brilliant and ground braking special effects we are still in a an age before computer generated imagery every thing is optical and physical including a stunning chase through a asteroid field. We follow the path of the Millennium Falcon between objects that have their own independent trajectory and bounce off each other. We learn the advantage of have regular service checks on your vehicle and the benefits of having every space craft made from the same airfix parts We are also introduced to new characters including a smooth and swishy Lando Calrissian, Muppet sage Yoda engaging in Hollywood's life long flirtation with Eastern philosophy and mysticism. A menacing villain in the Emperor played by Marjorie Eaton and voiced by Clive Revill (always good to hear the English actor on repeat viewings). The film benefits from not having the burden of a beginning or an ending and with nothing weighing on either side the film just shoots along. Neither Lucas nor his writers could think up an ending for The Return of the Jedi that was not just a slight rehash of the first film and from then on it would hugs and kisses at the end of every adventure. So perhaps it is an advantage that this film just comes to a stop.The reason why The Empire Strikes Back story flows concisely and logically could be because Lucas has taken a back seat to the rough trade of direction to concentrate on co-production. handing the reins over to Irvin Kershner a solid talented professional but not to original or individual a director. Lucas turned to professionals again for the script. Employing Lawrence Kasdan who would go on to work on Raiders of the Lost Ark and it's interesting to note that Leigh Brackett wrote an early draft. She goes back a long way and was greatly admired and often used by Howard Harks, who thought her pulp detective fiction (his favorite reading matter) was amongst the finest, he asked her to screen write the screenplay for The Big Sleep. Asking professionals to work with him on the script may explain why this episode feels the most mature, there are no Ewoks, no Ja Ja Binks here thank you very much. Leigh Brackett died in 1978 and not much if any of her work remains in the finished film but she would have recognized the type of dialog runing between Solo and the princess. It was first pioneered by Hawks in screw ball comedies during the thirties in films like Brining up Baby where it is noted by a pompous psychiatrist that \" the love impulse in men very frequently reveals itself in terms of conflict\" Lucas really was borrowing widely from everything he loved about the cinema of the past.Because of a driving accident just before filming started Mark Hamill's very visible facial scars needed to be explained in the plot, so the film starts with a mini adventure where Han Solo has to find Luke Skywalker who has been lost in the frozen landscape, before nights falls and the temperature drops. This intimate drama was concocted on the spot and yet look at how useful it is at underling the relationship of the characters have with each other right where it is needed at the start of the film. Han is reckless, fool hardy but all so decisive and focused. He is the first to realize that Luke is absent and he is prepared to risk everything to protect his Friend and because something needs to be happening before Solo can realize Lucas is missing, we see Solo and Leia constantly bickering in Howard Hawks style which continues on even as everything collapses around them. Everybody in the writing team is on the ball here and a unexpected necessity is turned in an asset for the production.John Williams provides another score for the film, the quality of the music is as high as the first and you might seamlessly travel from one to the other with out knowing you have crossed a threshold. William's score has been highly praised but I think that something is missing. William score for the original film has some wonderful small delicate wistful moments, as when Luke is contemplating his future while watching the suns of Tatooine go down, there is the wonderful cantina band music and that slightly off center rhythmic tic that is played as Han and Luke prepare for the TIE fighter attack. All of which is evidence of William's love of Stravinsky, Mahler and Prokofiev among others. As good as the music is in The Empire Strikes Back there is nothing quite as diverse as that in it's score. But it does have The Imperial March and the The Imperial March is ace. It was a long time before I realized that Williams composed it for the second film. It's hard to imagine that it was ever absent from the saga. It is without doubt the most the additive tune ever put to film. Start playing it in your head now! And see if you can stop from repeating the tune again and again, louder and louder until your lips start to move and your head bops from side to side. If you can manage that without making a fool of your self then you are no Star Wars fan.The most curious aspect of the film is Lucas' decision to had over the direction to somebody else and to concentrate on the production side. He felt that trying to do both would to difficult so he chose to produce. In no way was he handing over the film for somebody else to make as a director. As the film's producer he had total control over every aspect of the project to make sure it fitted his vision. By choosing not to be the director he didn't have to deal with an irreverence that was getting in the way with what he wanted , the actors. If technology did not allow him to do away with human beings, then at lease there must be a way of making a film with having to discuss acting with them.Eventually that technological dream would come true.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "the love impulse very frequently reveals itself in terms of conflict", "date": "2020-04-10T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5625796", "sentiment score": [0.0474, 0.1533, 0.2326, 0.4122, 0.1545]}, {"content": "After terrible first (4th movie) this comes at a surprise, it has much better action scenes and interesting ending.

Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones and Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, Rogue One, and A New Hope it's now time for The Empire Strikes Back. I thought A New Hope was the weakest one, okay it's the oldest one and so the special effects are not of the same level as more recent ones but the truth is that the later ones are just of better quality in every domain. the Empire Strikes Back was already a bit better but still not of the same quality as the others. I probably watched it as a kid and gave up after that as it's just not that good. I don't know why this one gets such a high rating, it's definitely not better than any of the previous titles mentioned. I agree that the used special effects at that time might have looked good for 1980 but still it doesn't make it better. For that the story and the acting were just not of the same quality. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing.The Star Wars saga is great because of the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, for that I just love it. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and will probably squeeze The Mandalorian between it, as long as the chronological order is respected.

This film is one of my favorite films of all time, it's my favorite \"Star Wars\" film of all time and my favorite sequel of all time.Indeed, this truly is one of the not just the best sequels that really helped set the standard in how to continue a franchise but also just simply established \"Star Wars\" as a saga in general. Let alone this is probably one of the darkest sequels ever as it's not the most cheerful which to me makes the film and story all the better because as an old saying goes sometimes when things are at their worst, is the time when people are at their best.The action is great, there are lots of memorable action pieces like one of my favorite battles of all time of course is the Battle at Hoth. I really love those Imperial Walkers I thought they were just awesome looking and at the same time really menacing as they look like giant dogs. I really love the model designs and stop motions effects by the late great Phil Tippit.There were also the first mechs I've ever seen, I really like how they move which is tank like which makes sense as they're by their nature giant tanks. Personally, I don't mind in fact sometimes like that kind of movement in mechs the best, as opposed to the flighty movement you would see in anime like \"Gundam\". Let alone the fact that these Walkers don't go down so easily, where in most anime despite how awesome looking the mecha is, they always seem to be built so flimsy as they go down in one hit or two. In a way this battle was sort of like a David vs. Goliath battle as we see the Rebels devise a clever tactic to taking down the Walkers which is cool because it's simple.The space chase with Han, Leia, Chewbacca, and C3PO is also awesome as we see they are all just jumping though hoops and going though the motions, doing their best getting steps ahead of the Imperial pursuers. Like going through the asteroid field which really put my on the edge of my seat as we know one wrong move your dead. Along with the cave they were all hiding in which to me is probably one of the biggest close calls ever, literally.Along with the saber action, really liked seeing Luke use the light saber a bit more in the film even the fight with Darth Vader which is one of my favorite one of one battles of all time. Sure, there was the fight between Obi Wan and Vader in the first film, but this fight I thought was a lot better because there was a lot more to the fight. From seeing not just Luke and Vader clash with he sabers but also utilizing and even using what's in their environment as their weapon. I even like in this battle it really feels like it could go either way, despite how skilled Luke is it might not be enough as Vader is more experienced. Or even from how the fight goes there are moments when it seems Luke might be able to turn the tables but there are times when it really looks like fate isn't smiling on Luke.The story and what I love in the sequel is that the character is better than before where their a little more fleshed out, three dimensional and less archetypical which makes us care about them more.From Han and Leia, both are one of my favorite fictional couples of all time. It sort of fit with the 80's decade as there were lots of TV shows based on romantic couples like \"Moonlighting\", \"Macross\", etc. Like with those shows both conflict and romance just go together and make a beautiful combo as both are somewhat the same, what is romance without conflict and love can really hurt and be scary sometimes. But most importantly in both this and those shows we already know these two belong together and are going to come together but it's a question of when.I really love the banter between both, which is funny but also endearing, both are somewhat opposites in many ways from class to just simply disagreement on just about anything to everything. But many both are in conflict because of how both feel for one another which is love. Han is more forward with his feelings despite not outwardly confessing and Leia is constantly in denial or confusion over hers which is why she is unable to admit her feelings to both him and she. As both spend more time together, we see just like any ship going out of light speed their feelings start emerging, which also makes what happens in the end even more tragic.Luke as usual is being Luke though here we see he's became a little more mature as he is now a rebel commander, so he's taken a little more responablity in both his career and life. However, that and time has not quilled a certain fire in his soul that is blazing out of control as Luke has became a lot more impatient and reckless which unfortunately leads to some bad choices that not just Yoda and Obi Wan are in disagreement with but us also. Sure, in some of those choices he had good intentions and in one scene goes out to help, but as two old sayings go, \"good intentions are nothing if there is no follow though\" and \"good deeds don't go unpunished.\" Things like that just show Luke still has a ways to go in the way of the Jedi.Darth Vader as usual is himself but we see he's a little more ruthless and even angrier than before which is reflected from his relentless determination throughout the film down to even offing anyone that makes one error too many. But what I like about him in this film is you get a little character out of him. There is an actual sense of emotion in his pursuit for Skywalker. This really deepens the mystery of the character more. Really liked one scene where he is talking with his master \"The Emperor\" whom we see for the first time, where it seems like in the conversation Vader voice sounds like he cares about Luke and what happens to him, but we're not sure why.Of course there is the new edition Yoda whom is voiced brilliantly by Frank Oz best known for his puppetry and vocal work in \"The Muppet Show\" and \"Sesame Street\", really like the look of the alien which is cute looking but also has a respectability about him. Yoda is one of my favorite characters in the franchise, to me he's sort of an alien version of Mr. Myogi. Just like Myogi he has his comical side but when the comedy ends, he really gets down to business. From the tone of his voice you really buy him as a person with a heavy amount of wisdom as well as emotion which makes both Luke and us take him seriously.The other thing is the story which I feel is both a rich sci-fi fantasy adventure but at the same time a rich personal character drama. The plotline we see the good guys are in a very bad place despite scoring a goal, the puck is now in the bad guys court and they are hitting them hard. Really like in this film we see some really dire locations from the Ice Planet Hoth, the swampy dank Dagobah system, and even part of the lower levels of Cloud City it really reflects the state and state of mind the good guys are in, all bad. But I like how despite this the good guys aren't going to sit there and take it; they might go down but their not doing it without a fight.The ensemble throughout the film are all split up, their barely together in the film except in a scene or two. But this actually turns out to be a good thing because it give each of the characters a chance to have their own story all interconnected into one big one; as well as us to become better acquainted with them and understand more of the universe they occupy.I really love some of the philosophy going on in the film which is mainly in the Jedi Training at Dagobah; it's richly thoughtful and one of the first films that actually go me into Philosophy. Really love seeing the Jedi Training going on, which kind of makes the film \"The Karate Kid\" in space. You really see how just like in any walk of life it takes hard work to become a warrior or anything else you want to be in life. Also the philosophy in the film really taught me about what fear really is and where it comes from, but also about the power of faith and what it really means.Then of course there is the big reveal near the end of the film, which was a total shocker at the time, even I was one of the people shocked I remember thinking \"You've got to be fraking kidding me!\". It was something I couldn't see 30 to 40 miles away. And I love that, I felt it was an example of a twist when done the right way, there was never any hints throughout the movie and there were never any in the previous film. This made it even more effective but also all the more dramatic because it actually makes sense.As an old saying goes, \"the battle may be lost, but the war is far from over.\"Rating: 4 stars", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Conflict in the Shadow of Darkness", "date": "2020-01-09T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5393733", "sentiment score": [0.0022, 0.0086, 0.0401, 0.3772, 0.5719]}, {"content": "To Me This Is The Perfect Movie , it's has Twists and turns and everything, Visually This Movie is Amazing The Special effects Still Holds Up To This Day , I Highly Recommend It.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "One Of The Best Movies Of All Time \ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f\ud83c\udf1f...!", "date": "2020-01-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5392308", "sentiment score": [0.0006, 0.0005, 0.0028, 0.0565, 0.9395]}, {"content": "A lot of fall out from a New Hope and build up to Return of the Jedi.

This film showed that the Star Wars universe was a cinematic world that had real grit and 'teeth' to it: even after the triumphant ending in the previous movie this one is defined by The Empire relentlessly pursuing The Rebellion in the wake of The Death Star's destruction during the Battle of Yavin 4, and it shows that 'fairy-tale endings' always have a deeper aftermath to them than you think and that hard-won battles need to keep going if the enemy is to give up. Battles may be won, but wars are different beasts altogether.The Empire Strikes Back is the sequel that came to be THE golden standard for movie sequels; without it there'd be no necessary sequels that are thought out for creative reasons as opposed to purely financial reasons. This film also proved to be quite the shocker when it came out in 1980: we finally found out what happened to Luke's father, and he wasn't killed by Darth Vader; HE became Darth Vader. This soon became THE greatest cinematic plot-twist of all-time, and forty years on it's still a hard one to top (if not outright impossible). It was Star Wars' equivalent of Citizen Kane's 'Rosebud' moment and both those twists are still inspiring narrative pillars for filmmakers today.Empire Strikes Back plays like an 'after happily-ever-after' ending that feels neither forced nor inauthentic to its world; everything is given real purpose, development, foreshadowing and closure like any self-respecting movie can attest to having. Its deliberate pacing and sense of menace is a nice contrast to Star Wars' more swashbuckling space-adventure, and the simple choice of not recycling the same plot (like so many prior sequels to other movies) as last time was another inspired choice this film took. Empire earns all its wings with all the good stuff it knowingly doesn't take for granted, like making sure the characters are the same as before but not totally unscathed either. You can also FEEL like they're in a much larger world too.Star Wars has become inseparable from cinema: it's a legacy of a franchise that came from George Lucas' desire to pay homage to the Flash Gordon serials of the 30s, and just like cinema itself people still actively discuss the series and medium to this day in ways that people dissect philosophy and religion to their heart's content. It's fun to look deeper into the things we love, and it's life-changing when you find newfound wisdom to make your mind and will stronger in life. Cinema may not be the same as it was decades ago (neither is Star Wars), but there's still plenty of new changes that show old and new techniques can become harmonious with one another: technology is not substitute for hard-earned storytelling or wisdom, but progress can help expand one's understanding of what they couldn't comprehend before.The Empire Strikes Back is one of cinema's all-time titans, and this is what sequels dream to become: an immortal experience that's set a bar so high it takes something truly incredible to surpass it (whoever may dare try to do so that is). 5/5 stars.P.

The great thing about Lucas was the yellow wording, if helps prepare you for the desperation of the situation.The rebels are like the band Wings, they are always \"on the run\".Han and Leia are still at each other, Luke is still following his VERY bumpy path to being a Jedi, and the droids well, like always, are caught in the middle.

He is, as they say on Family Guy, the \"cool\" side of the pillow. Lando is forced into a role he doesn't want to play and, for a moment, is viewed as unfriendly until things reveal themselves.And yes, this is the entry point of Yoda, the wise Jedi master that Luke finds in order to continue his training. Yoda is voiced and puppet-ed by Frank Oz, one of the most under-appreciated talents in the entire galaxy. I mean this man helped bring all the muppets to the main screen for Yoda's sake. He was a STAPLE of my childhood and i never even knew his name until i saw \"The Blue Brothers\" and \"Trading Places\" and he was an actor in those and i started going to the library and finding out what else he had done.Frank, in his own way, was a Jedia master.\"Luke! It's a trap!\" is one of the more memorable lines and Carrie Fishes won't let go of that wall until they hand her off of it. LOL!\nAll the elements are there: Relationships, arguments, comedy (very little but when it's needed), stress, action, fear, excitement and even a desperate \"i love you!\" and the coolest response to that ever \"....i know\".Fisher and Ford really carried a lot of this movie because of their in-between moments and arguments were so unforgettable. The droids, as well, should be given their credit for something of comedy relief.By the end of this movie, you've got both hope and dread and you might be feeling like things are all but lost.But it's like Ben Kenobi says, \"Your eyes can deceive you, don't trust them.And THIS is part of the reason the first movies were great.

Leia's a fighter, a leader, and as true of a hard-case (when necessary) as it gets. I've seen future female studio leaders \"claim\" there were a \"lack\" of strong female leads up until their time and that's total BS. Carrie Fisher was \"the line\" when it came to holding that sort of role down. She was a female actor but she played it like what she was, young and stressed because of the situation. She was unsure of her feelings because a lot was going on and it showed in the character but she was ANYTHING but weak.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "One of the few times the second picture is as good as the first", "date": "2019-12-15T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5324270", "sentiment score": [0.0384, 0.1222, 0.1796, 0.4595, 0.2005]}, {"content": "Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980). The perfect sequel to Star Wars. Included in the movie, we see the introduction of three characters. Each playing important roles that lead to the events of the end of The Empire Strikes Back to Return of the Jedi. First, we see the debut of Yoda. A small hermit like creature who happens to be a former wise jedi master who helps Luke advance as a jedi and (not knowing) to prepare him for his clash between the sinister Darth Vader. Throughout the movie, we also see the appearance of Lando Calrissian. An old friend of Han who is the administrator of the cloud city of Bespin. With the introduction of Lando, comes the clash of Luke and Vader and the mercenary, Boba Fett. Although he Boba plays only plays a short roll throughout the movie, he does bring sense of unknown and interest. Boba Fett's actions have importance which further continues into Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi. We also see a range of new planets including my personal favorite Bespin, Hoth and Dagobah. With the addition of the new characters and planets, The Empire Strikes Back is really the best Star Wars film to watch for those who are new to the franchise. Even though it lacks some elements that the original had done better, I still recommend it. But I do encourage you watch the first film before you watch The Empire Strikes Back so the story makes more sense. With the movie only earning one Oscar, it is the best of the lot.

The first was perfectly encapsulated by Aliens in the \"bigger is better\" school. You expand the stakes, scale, and number of character to create a bigger, bolder experience. The second is to not go bigger, but to go deeper. The Empire Strikes Back might be the best example of that way to go.The Empire Strikes Back actually feels a good bit smaller in scale than the original Star Wars. The biggest battle happens at the beginning of the film, involving a patch of icy land, several large walking tanks, and about a dozen speeders. That is smaller than the couple of dozen fighters attacking a moon sized base that can destroy a planet. The movie never goes bigger than that. In fact, the scale of the conflict continuously gets smaller as the film goes on.At the beginning, the conflict is between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. It's got galactic consequences, that great battle on the planet of Hoth. If the Rebel Alliance doesn't successfully get away, then the Empire's return strike after the destruction of the Death Star will wipe out its last major adversary for control of the galaxy. The next major set piece is the chase of the Millennium Falcon through the asteroid field. It's now one ship versus a handful of fighters and a Star Destroyer and the uncaring nature of outer space. It's a chase in order to capture the handful of occupants on board so that Darth Vader can lure Luke Skywalker.The final conflict is between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. We're more than an hour since the Rebel Alliance has even been mentioned. The conflict involves only two people, not half a dozen. It's no longer about galactic consequences. Instead it's about a father and son and a conflict of good versus evil. The fight of the film narrows, and the only reason it can pull that off is because of the characters.The original Star Wars utilized archetypes to tell its well-worn story. The Empire Strikes Back moves beyond the familiar hero's journey, and in order to accomplish that it needs to move beyond archetypes. Luke is no longer the farmboy hero. Instead he's an arrogant war hero who thinks far too much of himself. Han is no longer just the rogue, but a man with his own sense of right and wrong. Leia is no longer just the princess in need of help, she can push back on Han and control situations like she could only try to in the first. Darth Vader is no longer just the antagonist, he's now got a more complex goal of turning the hero to his side of the overall conflict. These characters are far more interesting in this second adventure than the first, and the story's structure of the second film is built to allow these characters to actually move through actions and change.The center and highlight really is Luke. As I wrote a second ago, he's wildly arrogant at the start of this film. He goes out to check out a meteorite on his own and escapes from the clutches of a giant snow beast without help from anyone else. He also leads the successful feint against the incoming Empire attack on the Rebel base on Hoth, providing enough time for the transports to get away free and destroying a few of the AT-ATs as well. When he's sent to Dagobah to find Obi-wan's former master, Yoda, he thinks that he's beyond humility. He doesn't need it. He's awesome. But from the moment he lands on Dagobah, he fails at everything he does through the rest of the film. The capstone of his training is when he walks into the cave and fails to use the Force in the ways that Yoda had dictated, fighting the phantom version of Darth Vader and revealing that he had only defeated himself in the fight. He fails to raise his X-wing from the swamp. He fails to maintain control of his emotions when visions of Han and Leia suffering come to him. He fails to listen to Leia's explicit warnings of a trap. He fails in his fight against Darth Vader, only escaping through a desperate act of falling down a giant hole.His constant stream of failures, capped by his failed confrontation with Darth Vader, humbles Luke. He no longer feels like he can face the evils of the universe alone. Dangling from the underbelly of Cloud City with only one hand, he calls out to Leia, desperate for any help. Even in the final moments of the film, he stands with his friends, not apart, and has become part of a plan to help the captured Han instead of running out there alone. Luke's journey in this film is fantastic all the more because it undermines the hero's journey he went through in the first. It goes against the idea of how we think hero's behave and succeed after their great victories.It's the character work that really makes the film work, but the movie continues the first film's proud tradition of great design. There are expansions of the world in things like the Super Star Destroyer and the walking tanks the AT-ATs. Yoda is a creature come alive with puppetry. The fighters, the planets, and creatures are all great. The special effects move the technology of the first film forward, and it's always in the service of the great story and character journeys at the heart of the film.Acting takes another step up as well. Moving directing duties from \"Faster, more intense\" George Lucas to Irvin Kershner was a surprisingly good choice overall, but it makes sense once you realize that The Empire Strike Back is more character film than science fiction adventure.The Empire Strikes Back is a magnificent sequel that takes the characters from the preceding adventure seriously and gives them space to grow, propelling them through an adventure that truly tests them.

Even today it remains as my favourite film in the franchise.Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back follows Luke Skywalker training more and more to become a Jedi whilst Han Solo and Princess Leia are pursued by Darth Vader.After A New Hope, everyone was so excited to see the next Star Wars film. It became one of the most anticipated films of the early 80s and once it finally came out, people just fell in love with it. This is the best Star Wars film to date and here's why.First of all the camerawork in this movie is absolutely excellent. RIP Irvin Kershner, you did a great job. The special effects definitely evolved since Episode IV as they look really good. It's astounding to think that this movie came out in 1980 because how beautiful the set design and effects were. Whilst A New Hope didn't have many fight sequences, this one has plenty and the action scenes are extremely entertaining to watch that keep the adrenaline flowing.Apart from all the positives mentioned, the area where this film shines is its characters. The acting by everyone was superb once again. Writers Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan wrote a beautiful script as we learn more about each of our beloved characters. The chemistry between Leia and Solo is fantastic and quite funny at times. We learn a lot about Luke's past and his relation to Vader which makes up for a great conflict between the two. If you thought Darth Vader was evil in the previous film, wait till you see how menacing he becomes in The Empire Strikes Back. This film also gave us YODA which was an absolute treat.The Empire Strikes Back is my favourite Star Wars film and I don't think any other film can reach its level. The film is well paced alongside some incredible action sequences that keep the intensity going. Our heroes are given a lot of depth which makes us root for them and care about them throughout and the villains have never been so menacing.

Any gripes about \"middle chapter syndrome\" or the absence of the purity and innocence that enriched the first chapter are nullified by the majestic scope, broadening its initial mythic clarity into the realm of operatic mystery.

I have always wanted to really like them but I never really could do to some of my issues with the films. Concerning Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back(1980) it was probably my least favourite of the three alongside Return of the Jedi. I'm still not quite sure whether I like it as much as A New Hope, but I learned to appreciate it more than before. I'm going to be comparing this movie quite a lot to its predecessor as its a direct sequel and makes the writing easier for me.This movie didn't have as many stunning visuals as a New Hope did. A few shots that stand out for me are shots of the Imperial fleet and also some shots of the Cloud City. On the other hand I feel like with the help of nice camerawork and more interesting locations and sets the visuals are overall more pleasing than in New Hope. Dagobah and the set of Lukes and Darth Vaders stand off especially impressed me. However, I feel like there was a lot more stop motion animation here and it was awfully distracting for me. The scene where Luke flings himself to the AT-AT and the scene where Luke falls to the carbon freezing chamber and then jumps out before Darth Vader could even realize are examples of scenes that are supposed to be tense but I find them really funny due to how ridiculous it looks. Some times the matte paintings also stood out quite badly but that I could deal with. Explosions looked much better than in A New Hope. The sound design remained awesome. Also some really nice additions to the score especially the ever so famous: The Imperial March.The first half of the first act of this movie is about Luke getting rescued from the wampa/snowstorm. While it adds some important things to the overarching story like Han willing to risk his life for a friend and reminding the viewer that Luke is in fact capable of using the force, I feel like like it's quite wasteful writing. It sort of feels like a too long prologue for me. After that the Imperials attack Hoth and some rebels die in the process of trying to slow them down. We get some reaction shots of Luke when they die but we never really have time to feel any emotion for them. This makes me care less about the rebels as our main characters don't seem to care all that much. Other than that the battle on Hoth is quite fun.The second act is split into following Leia, Han Solo, 3-CPO, R2-D2 and Chewbacca trying to escape the Imperials in the Millenium Falcon and following Luke pursue his own path trying to become a Jedi. Other than a few nice chase sequences between the Imperials and the Falcon and the chemistry between 3-CPO and Han, I wasn't all too invested. On the other hand everything related to Luke was some of the most enjoyable cinema I have ever seen. Dagobah as a location, literally everything about Yoda, Lukes struggles... I just wish we would have seen more of Lukes training instead of Imperials chasing the Falcon. Luke decides to, what may initially look like an act of selflessness, very selfishly try to save his friends putting everyone in the rebel alliance under danger.The third act is pretty interesting altogether. Finally the relationship between Leia and Han the whole movie has worked on pays off. Leia finally admits to loving Han as he is frozen in carbonate. After that we get iconic first meeting between Luke and Darth Vader. Apart from a few nitpicks, this scene is pretty much flawless to me. I kind of wish Luke didn't survive in such a stupid fashion although I understand it was necessary for him to believe he was killing himself and that he had to survive.We end Lukes arc in such an interesting state. He is healing from the fact his whole vision of the universe has shattered (also physically in the form of a new hand) as he always looked up to his father as an inspiration only for the face of evil to be revealed to him as his true father. He learns that his actions have consequences and that he was lucky he even survived. Now he knows he must be able to truly control the force if he wants to defeat Vader.This movie introduced two very welcome characters to the universe. Let's start off with Yoda. He is first introduced as a truly hilarious comic relief later for the viewer to discover he was only playing with Lukes patience. Everything Yoda says and the way he says it is always perfect. One of the greatest and most iconic characters ever. Then there is the friend of Han Solo, Lando Calrissian who resembles Han Solo (at least before this movie) : he is charismatic and on the thin line between good and evil. The difference between Lando and Han is that in a serious situation Han puts others ahead of his own greed whereas Lando initially doesn't. After Lando learns that he can't negotiate with Vader he risks everything and redeems himself.Whereas I feel like this movie has the highest highs in the trilogy so far I feel like the structure of the story lacks consistency required for me to give it 8/10 at the moment. So, I will give it a very strong 7/10 instead.", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "More Yoda and less everything else we want to see.

Whether it is the big reveal at the climax or the characterization of Yoda this story goes into much darker territory and as result feels like a much more believable film.On a technical level this is probably the best directed Star Wars film; there is a tightness to the visual construction the makes the world seem epic and grand without bogging the film down in overloaded visuals.

Well, Empire confirms that Lucas wasn't a one trick pony and confirms he is a genius in the cinematic world through vision and special effects. This time with Empire we get to see more of the rich galaxy from Lucas's mind and a better emotional tone than the first film which i felt was too lacking considering the genocidal actions of the imperial forces. While some people defend the lack of better emotional reactions in a new hope i argue that emotional reactions validate cinematic hardships. Well, In a new hope, Luke had begun to develop a bond (he wanted to be a Jedi like his father) or tie to his father who had fallen but he doesn't know the revelation ahead of him. Obi Wan the only person to truly help Luke understand who he is and where he comes from has died but his tie to Luke is still there helping him early before Han rescues him. We begin to see more of what the force is and Hans character development too in the rescue. The musical score also adds to the films tone which is something the first film didn't have enough of..i know for some the beautiful music as luke looks toward the sunset was enough in a new hope but since the emotion was off everywhere else i thought a musical score could have helped out or even a pensive stare later lol In empire strikes back we have the dreaded empire theme preceding Vaders 1st appearance in the film. Iconic music!. Before Luke uses the force in the beginning we hear soft music that precedes Lukes force use in a life or death situation.its actually emotional..we begin to see the force is about feeling. Later on Yoda hints to young Luke of the force, all of it and how scary it can get. Force users can succumb to darkness. Vader was once a decent person. Yoda tells luke you will..you will be.. (afraid)..Yoda warns naive Luke basically to help him on his journey because the road ahead is extremely arduous, physically and emotionally. Every force user faces fear..yoda trains luke as much as possible given the time..luke knows his friends are in danger yet despite all warning luke chooses his friends over yodas and obi wans warning. Luke is actually seen as reckless but imo he is facing fear and runs to it actually. I can go on and on how empire strikes back is a fantasy masterpiece in space..everything has been said about this film and why it is historic. There are cinematic moments the world will never see or hear again. Period. Yes the plot isn't perfect, but it is how the story was told..even better than the first film mind you fantasy films are difficult to pull off..The only fantasy world that i can think of off the top of my head with decent characters was the earlier seasons of game of thrones. Fantasy films are not easy to pull off given the 2 to 3 hours time given. Lucas created a masterpiece in over 2 hours.\nWith all being stated, Empire strikes back revealed that at his best George Lucas is a visionary genius and the world will likely never see such an original story told on the big screen like this one.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Lucas is some kinda genius in the world", "date": "2019-11-28T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5286899", "sentiment score": [0.0256, 0.0966, 0.2214, 0.476, 0.1804]}, {"content": "The Empire Strikes Back is one of the best sci-fi movies ever created and is perfect in it's worldbuilding and storytelling.

Harrison Ford's portrayal of Han Solo is much better and more enjoyable in this sequel. His charisma is a delight. The chemistry these characters have is perfect.The opening scene where Luke Skywalker gets captured by a Bigfoot looking creature and saved by Han Solo is one of the best opening scenes ever and proves that the movie is fast paced and dives right into the plot.The appearance of Ben Obi Wan Kenobi and him being a sort of guide to Luke Skywalker is great. He inspired Luke to become a Jedi. On the other hand, Yoda trained Luke to become a Jedi, but his training was short lived.The final fight between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader aka Anakin Skywalker is amazing. The infamous \"I am your father\" line fitted perfectly in the scene.The ending sets up the third movie in the franchise where Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, C3PO and R2D2 set out on a mission to rescue Han Solo from Jabba the Hutt.To conclude, Empire Strikes Back is a worthy sequel and even better than the first Star Wars movie.

I don't count the 'prequels' or recent 'sequels', spin-offs and such.The original film was lots of fun, but it was also trying to find out what it was, to establish a distinct tone, to define the universe it was played in, and so on. Also, a limited budget impacted the production in tangible ways. Now, for 'Empire', they had all these things in place. The characters were developed, the universe defined, the budget was there. Also, a better film director was employed this time around.The film further develops the characters, in most enjoyable and interesting ways. There is drama here, that neither the first nor the third film ever came close to. And the scenes on Hoth remain the most memorable for me personally.But there is a problem here: the exploration of the 'force'. It never went anywhere. It got bogged down in the swamps of Dagobah, and became incoherent drivel that seemed to randomly pick up elements from various philosophies. Yoda's teachings have all the depth of a 'How to find peace with the universe' booklet you can buy for a dollar. I hated Yoda and everything about him. When they realised they were dealing with quasi-philosophical nonsense, the filmmakers tried to compensate for it by making Yoda arrogant and pretentious, as he makes silly demands on his pupil. Also, the return of Obi Wan was annoying to me, and totally unnecessary. But another problem is created by turning Luke's training into his mess: he remains an alien character. We emote with Han, Leia, Chewie, and the droids, but not him. He never becomes intriguing or relevant for our emotional investment in the film. Until the end of the third film, he remains this alien figure that exists to push forward the plot about the 'force', while everything truly interesting and emotionally engaging revolves around the other protagonists. His confrontations with Vader remain sterile and feel like something the film is obligated to deliver, but no one truly enjoys. When I was a kid, I wanted to be Han Solo.

The arrival of both the androids, as Luke himself to Jabba the Hutt's lair, to rescue a captured Leia in her attempt to rescue her beloved Han Solo herself, and who has been turned into a sexy slave with one of the most erotic outfits that have been seen in the history of cinema.All that first initial part, until the destruction of Jabba's ship in the well of the almighty Sarlacc, is masterful, hilarious and unforgettable.So, what prevents me from giving this delivery a higher grade? Very simple, the second half of the film with the arrival of the protagonists in Endor, hits a tremendous downturn that perhaps many do not know or do not want to perceive. Simply the whole teddy bear roll is completely left over because it is too childish and even boring. Until that time Star Wars had been a saga for an adolescent-adult audience, but the inclusion of these ewoks already downgraded it to a movie for kids, which did not have to be, but of course, greater public higher income, Lucas is Very very smart, I've always said it.The development, well, we are told about the final echos that lead to the destruction of the second death star, by Darth Vader, ultimately redeeming himself, the death of Palpatine and the end of the Imperial dictatorship, making the republic and the Restoration of the Jedi as guardians of peace in the galaxy. All this in a spectacular and very emotional climax, with melodies by John Williams during the Luke-Vader clash that freeze the blood, phenomenal and very dark.I, like many others, prefer the original 1983 version, in which Sebastian Shaw appeared at the end as Anakin Skywalker, and not Hayden Cristiansen's mammon, which does not stick with a deadly tail in that scene, since on top The effect is fatal and very forced. I also don't like modern fx additives in some sequences simply because they don't connect well with the visual aspect of the set. But this is just my opinion.It is a great sequel and conclusion of the first trilogy, but due to erroneous decisions that I have commented, some teddy bears making antics and certain highs and lows of rhythm and a not very bright direction of Richard Marquand, tied hand and foot as said by Lucas , which controlled even the smallest aspect of its \"toy\", as Spielberg once defined it, makes it not so satisfactory and round, since it does not have the opera tone of the first two wonderful parts.", "rating": 6, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 6}, "heading": "Fall of the galactic empire", "date": "2019-09-28T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5148737", "sentiment score": [0.0119, 0.1164, 0.486, 0.34, 0.0457]}, {"content": "Showed it to my 10year old son today.

The Empire Strikes Back took that high bar & raised it further. A very much darker tone to the movie is set out from the start. The opening crawl says 'It is a dark time for the Rebellion'. The joy & celebration of victory in the Battle of Yavin is long in the memory. The Empire are on the hunt, hell bent on wiping the Rebels out.\nThe Rebels plight is highlighted by their new base on an arctic wasteland of a planet with minimal life & less warmth. We get to know more about the characters, their motivations & their demons. Luke is struggling with his destiny, his role as a leader & his possible future as a Jedi, Leia is conflicted by her feelings for both Han & Luke. Han is worried primarily about his own neck & how to save it.\nThis brings us to the films major set piece which at the time was a nightmare to film. Firstly the main all action set piece comes in the first act & secondly the film crew were m trying to superimpose multiple moving objects on a white background which was more than tricky. The Battle of Hoth is immense & massively satisfying even though the Rebels take a right pounding.\nThe film very much changes tack as it concentrates on the main protagonists. It becomes very emotionally charged either through the blatant romantic tension between Han & Leia to the trials of Luke during his Jedi training where he is trying to learn all of the skills & techniques that he needs to become a Jedi whilst trying to conquer his own self doubt & his failures which seem to haunt him.\nThe emotion that is poured into the second act really builds up the suspense. You know that the Empire are coming at some point, you know that something is going to happen & it won't be good. We get introduced to key new characters such as Yoda, the Jedi Master & Luke's teacher who pushes him to his limits & has no qualms in telling him his limitations & failings. There is also Lando who is an acquaintance of Han's but there is something not right about him.\nThe third act is just filled with all out action, emotion & revelation including what can only be described as the greatest scene in cinematic history which if made today couldn't be kept a secret like it was back in 1980. It leaves you as the viewer, numb with disbelief as this bomb is dropped in the middle of this super emotional sequence of events & you don't know where it is going.\nHowever, there has to be something, something we can hold onto moving forward & you are given just that small amount of hope at the end that there is a way back.\nThroughout the entire film there is one thing that makes it work, as it did with its predecessor & that is the music. John Williams is an absolute genius & this is his greatest piece of work ever (how he didn't win at the Oscars for it is nothing short of a scandal). He manages to drive the entire mood of the film at every point. He generates tension, sadness, fear, threat, heroism, relief & at the end even hope. The film would not be the same without it.As films go there are probably better written & directed films with better stories but Empire was a massive risk. Sequels were hard to make & never lived up to the originals. Also there was the case that this wouldn't be a standalone film. There would have to be a third instalment to close it out. Empire succeeds on all of these levels to such an extent that it is the greatest sequel of all time & it easily surpasses any of the other Star Wars films. I'm happy to say without hesitation that it's my favourite film of all tine & I would argue my stance that it's the greatest film of all time because it delivers just as much today as it did nearly 40 years ago & not many films can do that. It is the pinnacle of the cinematic experience even when matched against its predecessor (which was wonderful in its own right) & against other masterpiece blockbusters such as The Matrix, Jurassic Park, & Avengers Infinity War/Endgame.\nYou just don't make films better than The Empire Strikes Back.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "The GREATEST piece of Filmmaking ever!", "date": "2019-06-22T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4952418", "sentiment score": [0.0084, 0.0709, 0.2543, 0.5503, 0.116]}, {"content": "It was terrific but i'm not sure if it's the best one in the series or not, i'll say after watching the whole series.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "no", "date": "2019-06-22T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4951770", "sentiment score": [0.0054, 0.0318, 0.3978, 0.4702, 0.0947]}, {"content": "It was great at everything\nIam officially fan of han solo and darth vader\nDialogues were good and screenplay was well written, Harrison ford nailed it as Han solo", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Great movie", "date": "2019-06-18T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4943399", "sentiment score": [0.0086, 0.0159, 0.0639, 0.3563, 0.5553]}, {"content": "I view this as the canon ending to George Lucas original vision.

I'm sure Mr Lucas had no idea how much it would change the world either. Ever since a new hope came out people began to dream of the stars and picked up sticks to become Jedi.I write a critic of my favourite of all the Star Wars films and that being Empire Strikes Back released three years after A New Hope. We return to a Galaxy Far Far Away to the aftermath of the Death Star being destroyed, on the ice planet called Hoth. Luke, Leia, Han and Chewie are on a rebel base preparing for evacuation from the Empire! From the get go there's a feeling that the rebels and our heroes aren't going to fair well in this film.Luke is captured by a Wampa and almost died, AT-ATs completely walk all over the base (literally) and Vader is on a juiced up revenge path destroying all in his path. After losing on Hoth Luke ends up on Dagobah being trained by the mysterious little green creature... do or do not, there is no try. Han, Chewie and Leia end up being chased around by the Empire in the ever failing Millennium Falcon. All paths connect again on Cloud City where we meet the dashing Rogue Lando Calrissian, who although a friend of Hans betrays him to Vader. Han is frozen and sent off to Jabba the Hut, Luke turns up and then the biggest cinematic reveal of all time hits us... Luke I am your father!!!!I remember watching Empire in 1997, I was holding my X Wing and watching in awe. I remember the shock and screaming at the screen when Luke found out. A whole 17 years later and the film is still as powerful and hard hitting. George Lucas has created a masterpiece and a legacy!

I love this film to death, it is my second favorite film and the best sequel in the Star Wars franchise that I love. The Empire Strikes Back is a movie that it is one of the best sequels I can think of, it is right there with Aliens (1986), it is right there with Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) it is an excellent sequel and it really does establish The Empire as a value treat. Empire Strikes Back is still and excellent film which I really believe is a timeless classic. This is my second favorite film from director Irvin Kershner. Number 1 favorite Irvin Kershner film will be RoboCop 2 (1990) which is very underrated action flick. I still have to review those movies someday.Empire Strikes Back (1980) is the best one of the series, because it's deeper, darker, more philosophical. It's great because Darth Vader and the Empire are at their most menacing, the direction is creative, the characters feel real, the nature of the Force is explored more without losing its mysticism, and the pacing is, as George Lucas would put it, faster and more intense than any other film in the saga.The plot is actually more a rescue mission that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is coming to rescue his friends Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO and Chewbacca are captured on a planet Bespin in Cloud City from villainous Darth Vader. Han Solo's friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) set the up and with Darth Vader he set a trap for Luke. Also Luke studied the Force under Jedi Master Yoda to become a full Jedi Knight but in the end he must confront Darth Vader (David Prowse) by him self. The origins of Luke Skywalker are reveled.Empire Strikes Back was released in 1980 it is directed by Irvin Kershner this time and not George Lucas. Because George Lucas decide that he want to make this sequel independent one, so he ended up coming with his own, founding for the film. Getting a loan and money he earn from the first movie and it success, so he decided he wanted, to found the film him self, and he wanted to be more an executive producer to keep an eye on the lamp, he moved to a bigger studio in Orange County, California, so he diced to be more a producer he did not want to direct Empire Strikes Back. So his first choice was Irvin Kershner, who was a professor at UC in the UC film school, that George attended too and he always liked Irvin Kershner and of course he was a former professor and it was a hard way talk him to do it and the first time Irvin Kershner didn't want to do it, so George called Irvin's agent and his agent said to Irvin take it so he did and the rest is a history. This stands the test of time, the best film he ever directed! I love John Williams score still the same, but I think John Williams changed the music score for a little bit, but that's just my opinion.Things that I love in this film: I love the battle with Rebels fighting with the Imperial AT-AT walkers on the ice world of Hoth. That is my favorite scene on ice world in the film. The Imperial AT-AT walkers are incredible well made with classic special effects.I love that the origins of Luke Skywalker are reveled, that Luke is the son of Darth Vader, who is actually Anakin Skywalker, before he become Darth Vader and went to the dark site.For the first time ever, we see an Emperor in a Hologram talking to Darth Vader.The Falcon with Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO and Chewbacca hiding in the rocks try's to eat a monster.Luke faces with Darth Vader him self face to face and get his arm cut off and then he jumps off the bridge, because he didn't want to join his father in a dark force. The lightsaber duel throughout the chamber between Luke and Darth Vader was excellent and it was epic.The training sequence with Luke and master Yoda were excellent and epic.A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back are my favorite films in series, that are in the franchise, this film get's a perfect 10 score for been the best sci-fi adventure sequel of all time.", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Excellent timeless classic, the best sequel of all time!", "date": "2019-05-26T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4888797", "sentiment score": [0.0024, 0.0062, 0.0196, 0.2723, 0.6995]}, {"content": "This is my favorite movie!!!

True, I'd already seen the original Star Wars and even though I'd quite liked that movie, it wasn't until I'd seen this one that I really fell for the saga. And all of this, mainly because, in almost every level, this movie is clearly superior to the original. The tone is darker, the characters' story arcs are better developed ( the love triangle only hinted at in the first movie is finally resolved, Luke's path as a Jedi and his ultimate and painful discovery of his origins), and the multiple twists and turns of the plot takes the story to very interesting places. It's this journey of love and self-discovery, coupled with the amazing use of its visual elements ( production values on this one were clearly taken up a notch) that makes this, not only the ultimate Star Wars movie, but also the ultimate sequel. John William's score is ,once again, astounding. Due to, not in small measure, a very well written script by Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett, George Lucas's involvement only being in the general plotting of the storyline, the movie gains a level of mastery sadly never achieved with the following sequels. Of special significance are the Planet Hoth battle, the Millenium Falcon chase by the Imperial Fleet through an asteroid field and the ultimate confrontation between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker on the Cloud City of Bespin, where it takes place one of the most shocking reveals in cinematographic history.\nThis is clearly an example of the sequel being quite superior to the original.

They concentrate on action too much, substituting character psychology. Or so the argument goes in Bordwell & Thompson's 2006 book \"Film Art\" - whether or not you agree with any of this, there is no questioning Star Wars' role in facilitating it.\"The Empire Strikes Back\" was the first sequel to the hugely successful 1977 blockbuster \"A New Hope\" - picking up where the other left off but, strangely, not really feeling like it does an awful lot to advance what we witnessed other than put its protagonist through a training regime and have his friends chased around space by some villains for 90 minutes. How far have things REALLY been advanced by the time this 1980 effort has finished, beyond a quaint love story and a jarring familial revelation?The film's opening act takes place on a barren, wintry planet called Hoth. Following the destruction of the Death Star at the end of Episode 4, a weapon capable of destroying a single planet in one foul strike, a military group known as 'the Rebels' retreat in the wake of an Empirical counter-attack, which involves despatching robotic probes to various parts of the galaxy to scout the potential positions. What everyone is fighting for, we still don't know. Later on, during a conversation about mineral mining in a visually impressive city built into the sky, it is inferred the fighting is to do with control of natural resources.When we first see the series' hero, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), on the surface of Hoth in a blizzard, he looks a little like an alien in his arctic gear complete with goggles and mouth-scarf - you might say he bears a passing resemblance to the film's villain, Darth Vader, whose jet-black helmet covers his entire face and gives him a similar un-human quality. Skywalker unfurls his coverings, looking far more grizzled than in the first film. We are then lulled into a false sense of security when ally Han Solo (Harrison Ford) confirms over a radio that the 'sensors' are in place. Job done, we conclude - but Luke is ambushed by a snow monster and dragged off to its cave.Not returning, and with Solo out there looking for him, the base takes the decision to close the main doors as the dark creeps in and the perishing cold become overwhelming. Cleverly, director Irvin Kershner focuses on the pained expression of Princes Leia (Carrie Fisher) as they shut - whose fate does she fear for the most? Luke's escape from the Yeti provides us with a tantalising early look at the power of the lightsaber, which takes the monster's arm clean off - an important detail for a later duel... But why does Luke then LEAVE the safety of the cave as the storm rages? Why did the film have him caught in the first place? Half-dying in the snow, he has a vision of dead friend Obi-wan (Alec Guinness) who tells him to seek \"Yoda\" on another planet so that he may complete Jedi training, but we know that Obi-wan can appear at any time to tell him this - Luke doesn't need to be on his last legs and think he's hallucinating.Eventually, one of those enemy probes passes by the base, but the Rebels mysteriously attack it when the plan was to maintain invisibility - why not just let it pass? Cover blown, the Empire attack - but are the Rebels evacuating the base or defending it? We're not sure. Irrespectively, the act ends when the Hoth fight ends - Solo; Leia; Chewbacca and a friendly robot named C3PO leave on Solo's ship whereas Skywalker departs to find Yoda with R2D2.From here, the film cuts into two halves: Luke's strand is slow, methodical and contemplative as he spends time on a jungle planet with a small green alien learning how to perfect abilities in 'the force', whereas Solo and the gang endure a more causality driven experience as Vader's ship pursues them through asteroid belts; the stomachs of giant worms and cities built into the clouds.What becomes curious about the film at this stage is that the antagonist, Vader, makes a conscious decision to pursue Skywalker not to kill him, but capture him so that they may join together as villains. In addition to this, an entire passage of the film beds said protagonist down in one place so that he may learn about patience; concentration and being contemplative - hardly things associated with 'post-classical' cinema. By today's standards, this is positively blockbuster revisionism. But surely there is a hole in Skywalker's training: is he not working towards wrecking a revenge on Vader? Isn't this contrary to the force's teachings?Solo's strand is more simplistic, more familiar to this post-Star Wars era blockbuster school: the bad-guys are chasing the good-guys; there is a meagre romance between Solo and Leia - royalty mingling with common-folk. Amusingly, Kershner uses a recurring gag to do with Solo's ship's power-thrust mechanic failing to roar into action when he needs it, and we grin at the metaphor. Strikingly, very little of any real interest happens on this strand which seems present to keep people amused as the other stuff plays out.I read and hear of people remarking how much 'darker' the film's tone is, and so it is better than IV, but I would disagree. Tonally, the films seem quite similar - certainly, the characters here are in hairier situations, but so what? It ends on more of a downbeat note, for Skywalker; Solo and even Vader, but does so in order to tee up the next film, not because its ending is in line with any kind of thematic it's exploring. How is one to conclude now, almost 40 years on from the changing of the cinematic guard? \"Empire...\" is functional, but perhaps undeserved of its status.", "rating": 6, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 3}, "heading": "\"Laugh it up, fuzzball...\"", "date": "2019-03-09T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4710577", "sentiment score": [0.0461, 0.3908, 0.4087, 0.1433, 0.0111]}, {"content": "Nothing to say.

To me this is the best of the whole series of films so far containing both secrets and the introduction of a few great characters to be added to the list of STAR WARS cast. To me as well this film sits only behind Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY in space stories put on screen.Darth Vader (David Prowse, voice of James Earl Jones) is on the hunt for the Rebels. It looks like he has found them, so the Rebels are on the run to escape his clutches. Han Solo (wonderfully played by Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) bring along Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) within the Millennium Falcon (which gets a lot of screen time in this film). Meanwhile Luke (Mark Hamill) is of the Dagobah system in search of Yoda (voice of Frank Oz) to continue his Jedi training.This film is different than the original and really is much darker as the title of the film suggests. John Williams is back and with new themes like the amazing 'Imperial March' he has an even richer score than the original. I do believe Lucas did the right thing in bringing in two excellent screenwriters in Leigh Brackett and later Lawrence Kasdan. I have no idea who came up with what idea, but I am glad Lucas got some fresh perspectives and perhaps ideas to infuse into his space epic. As well as having veteran director Irvin Kershner direct the sequel. This film has everything a STAR WARS fan loves.Also starring Billy Dee Williams who is pretty cool as Lando Calrissian...until Chewie gets ahold of him and look fast for John Ratzenberger who plays Major Derlin.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "\"No. Try not.

While it's predecessor was simply just a lot of fun, this film is something special.Luke is an extremely flawed character. He rushes into things eithout thinking things through, he is very whiny, etc. But all at once, that's what makes him such a great character. Characters are supposed to be flawed, but that doesn't mean they shouldn't get development to make them less flawed. People complained about Luke being s whiny character, but that's part of the development process. Characters start off bratty and childish, but eventually get better with each film.The story of this film is amazing. From the pacing and dark tone to the characters and writing, this film has a lot going for it. The first film also had a good story, but the characters didn't have as much development. Not to mention that unlike A New Hope, Empire has a much darker tone to it. After the Rebels lose the Battle of Hoth, there's really this feeling of uncertainty as to what will happen to our heroes next. And Darth Vader is, in my opinion, one of the most iconic and badass villains in movie history. And the scene where Luke rushes to Cloud City before he could complete his training to help his friends after they're captured by the Empire really shows just how flawed of a character he is.Empire is a special movie.

Let me preface by saying that I am a lifelong Star Wars fan who grew up with the original trilogy and literally have no memory of a time in my life before SW. As such, I am not going to be totally unbiased in my reviews, but I will try to be somewhat objective.Three years after the destruction of the Death Star, Han, Luke, and Leia are now all important leaders and heroes in the Rebel Alliance, which is hiding on the barely-habitable ice planet of Hoth. The Empire eventually finds their base and attacks it, scattering the rebels around the galaxy, with Luke going to Dagobah to be trained by Yoda, and Han, Leia, Chewie, and the droids playing cat-and-mouse across the sector with Vader and the Imperial fleet before finally being captured at Cloud City on Bespin. There, Han is frozen in carbonite to be sent to Jabba the Hutt, and Luke, attempting to rescue his friends, is forced into a confrontation with Vader for which he is not ready and which will forever change his life.This is the most critically-praised of the SW movies, for reasons I only partially understand. As a kid this was always my least favorite of the movies, probably because it's very talk-y and there are no big space battles. As an adult, I've come to appreciate it a lot more due to the character development and its slightly more mature take on SW, but it's still definitely not my favorite of the saga. THE GOOD-This is the first movie (both in my viewing order and in the order made) not directed by George Lucas, and because of that, this is also the best movie by far for dialogue. Irving Kershner and the actors rewrote a lot of the lines on the set, and as a result the banter between Han and Leia and Lando is generally good and for once the characters talking is a highlight rather than a lowlight.-Assisted by the above point, this movie is great in the character development realm. Not only in terms of Han, Leia, and Luke, but also the supporting characters like Chewie and the droids.-Boba Fett and the Slave I-\"Apology accepted, Captain Needa.\" You can almost see Hayden Christensen's malicious sneer as Vader says that line.-I gained a lot of respect for Kershner while listening to the commentary. He had his own spin that he wanted to do on SW, but he also had great reverence for what Lucas had done in ANH and he made sure to be faithful to the spirit of that movie in every way possible.THE BAD-Hate, hate, HATE that they replaced Boba Fett's voice with the actor who plays Jango in AotC. The original Fett voice actor had an awesome menacing, gravelly voice and the new voice sounds pathetic by comparison.-I'm not a big fan of stop motion animation and there is a lot of it in this film. The AT-ATs look fine, but the tauntauns do not. However, the closeups of the animatronic tauntauns look incredible, so it evens out a bit. THE UGLY-Apparently the Falcon is able to reach a different planetary system without hyperdrive. No indication is given of distance or how long that took, but we know that that Hoth is on the outer rim where stars are far apart, so most likely any trip that took less than decades would require near-lightspeed velocity that would have some severe relativistic repercussions. Considering Luke seemed to do quite a lot of training during that time, it's possible there is an unacknowledged time lapse of several months, but certainly not years.-I am forced to wonder what Vader's real plan was. We know he wants to overthrow Palpatine and that he wants to use Luke to do so, but he repeatedly says that he is planning on bringing Luke to the emperor. Was he just saying that for show, all the while planning on smuggling Luke away somewhere secret until he could convince him to join hist plot against Palpatine? Anakin already saw how Palpatine would gladly cast aside an old, less powerful apprentice (Dooku) for a younger and more powerful one (himself), so there's no way he would be stupid enough to actually deliver Luke to him. Doing so would be signing his own death sentence. Yet he inexplicably does that exact thing in the next movie and then looks shocked when Palpatine does to him exactly what he did to Dooku. So maybe Anakin is really just that stupid?

Their friendship has grown stronger for one another; especially Leia and Han's. The Rebellion have found and formed a rebel base on the ice planet of Hoth. It seems to be going well, until an Imperial Probe Droid is dispatched out to the planet. It locates the rebel base, sends the report to Vader( James Earl Jones). Once the findings are complete the droid automatically self-destructs. The Battle of Hoth begins, with the successful flight of the first transport off of Hoth. Leia is reluctant to leave until Han says she has to go, he successfully gets her aboard the Falcon just in time. The fighting continues, but eventually dwindles down. The rebels tell Luke they will see him eventually at the rendezvous.\nLuke has other plans he and R2( Kenny Davis) set a new course for the Degobah System. Once there Luke will track down Yoda( Frank Oz ) to begin his Jedi Training. Meanwhile, Han, Leia, Chewbacca( Peter Mayhew ), and C-3PO( Anthony Daniels )are having trouble trying to escape the Imperials. The Star Destroyer Avenger is right on their tail, along with a ton of TIE fighters right into an asteroid field. Han is slick he fly's through the field like a pro. He realizes he must find one that he can land on for awhile. As soon as he can, he moves close to this huge asteroid. It seems like they have found a safe place to lie low. The Millennium Falcon has taken a lot of hits and is in need of repairs soon. Han and Leia at times seem to be at each others throats, but deep down they strongly have feelings for one another.\nOn the Star Destroyer Avenger, The Emperor Palpatine( Ian McDiarmid), makes contact with Vader. He warns him of their new enemy, Luke Skywalker. Vader believes if he could be turned to the dark side he would be a powerful ally, a great asset. Luke's training on Dagobah is tough and sometimes turbulent. Yoda gives him advice, but Luke sometimes fails to listen. This is particularly noticeable when his X-Wing sinks deeper into the swamp and his failure through the cave. He is angry, feels hopeless, until Yoda talks to him more about the Force. Yoda proves his might by helping get Luke's X-Wing free, using his Jedi skills.\nHan and Leia still stuck on the Asteroid, discover a terrifying fact. They are not on the asteroid, but inside a worm creature that dwells in the rock. They are able to get back on board and fly out just in time. As soon as they are free, they are met with enemy fire from TIE fighters and The Star Destroyer Avenger. Han turns the Falcon around, makes a bluff and proceeds into attack mode. Captain Needa( Michael Culver) on board the Avenger is shocked. The Falcon is there one second then gone. Upon seeing this , he realizes he has make a fatal error; and must report to Vader. The Falcon has docked aboard The Avenger until they can fly away undetected to a safe place. Han tells Leia the way they will escape is when the Avenger dumps it's trash, then we will float away undetected along with the rest of the trash. In the meantime they must search for a safe port to land, in The Onenid system. They find Bespin, which is home to Cloud City. Han is familiar with it's administrator, Lando Calrissian ( Billy Dee Williams). Inside The Avenger, Darth Vader employs a few bounty hunters to find the Falcon. A substantial reward await the one who finds it. Among them is Boba Fett ( Jeremy Bulloch). He is the Mandorolian, who vows to make good on Vader's promise. When the trash is released, The Falcon detaches; and heads for Cloud City, not realizing Boba Fett is behind them, in Slave 1.\nLuke's is now training successfully, but it is suddenly interrupted when he sees visions of the future. He tells Yoda he must go and save them, but Yoda demands he must stay and complete his training. Luke promises he will return, and fly's off.\nOnce The Falcon arrives in Bespin Air space, the four are met with numerous Cloud City pod cars. They are authorizing them for a landing permit which they don't have. It gets a little uneasy, but finally they get permission to land. They are instructed to land on Platform A, I believe. Once they get out of the Falcon there is no one there to greet them-strange. This makes Leia very uneasy, and Han gets upset with her. A few minutes pass, finally Lando along with his trusted aide Lobot( Jack Hollis ) arrive. At first, it looks like it could be an angry reunion, but Lando welcomes them, especially Leia. While in Cloud City Han and Lando catch up on old times, Han tells Lando the Falcon needs repairs. Leia senses something is wrong especially when 3PO goes missing. When Han and Leia are alone waiting for Lando, she tells Han something just isn't right. When Chewy comes in he is carring C-3PO, he's been blown into parts. Leia hopes Chewy can fix him fast.\nLando comes in notices the droid and says something, but he wanted Han and Leia to join him in a refreshment first. Once they arrive to dine, the door opens up. There is Vader, Fett, and stromtroopers and they surround them. Lando said he had no choice but to turn them in, Lando was offered a deal to fix his own problems.When Han and Leia are held captive Lando tells the two, Vader doesn't want them; but Skywalker. Leia and Han realize they are bait and will experience torture while there. Vader tests the carbon freezing chamber on Han successfully. Han is frozen and given Fett. The chamber is reset for the Emperor's real prize- Skywalker. When the deal Lando made with Vader keeps changing for the worse. He realizes he must do something to save his friend, but it's too late. \nVader gets news that an X-Wing is approaching, he tells the commander to allow Skywalker to land. Once Luke lands, he notices Leia. Leia Shouts it's a trap. Luke will find Vader confront him in a light-saber duel; and realizes the truth about Vader. It's up to Leia, Lando, and Chewy must conjure a plan in order to find Han.The Empire Strikes Back is the best of the original trilogy. It is packed with action, adventure, and a big surprise.

Darth Vader actually says 'No I am your Father' in reply to Luke protesting otherwise.

Luke goes to the Dagobah system to learn from the wise Master Yoda. The rest of the heroes are attempting to flee from the Empire until Han finds an old friend in Cloud City. However, something sinister is happening in Cloud City and Luke senses this through the force.What is so great about this sequel is its masterful blend of action, humour and deep philosophy. The battle of Hoth draws you into the movie with its spectacular special effects.

We also have more humorous adventures with Han, Leia, Chewie and C3PO.The climax is what separates this movie from the rest of the series. Essentially the heroes lose and the Empire gains the upper hand. We also discover a dark secret which wowed people at the time. People didn't know what to think at the time of release but now it's cemented as the series high point.Essentially this movie managed to expand upon what was already a perfect roller coaster ride of a movie.

It is not just a living legend and a cinematic masterpiece, it is the sacred text of the mythology of Star Wars. A New Hope introduced us to the Star Wars galaxy and gave us a hint of its mythology, but The Empire Strikes Back created and entire mythology which ranks as the greatest imaginative exercise in the history of cinema. The good: 1. It's all good!2. The pace: like A New Hope, the pacing of this movie is perfect. Nothing drags, nothing is out of place, everything flows smoothly with ever-increasing tension to a stunning, legendary conclusion.3. The Battle of Hoth: this is a Star Wars battle as it should be, visually stunning and emotionally compelling.4. Cloud City - a wildly imaginative visual masterpiece, its glittering exterior masking its increasingly sinister nature. 3. Darth Vader - \"You have failed me for the last time!\" - Here we see why Darth Vader has become the greatest and most iconic cinematic villain of all time, with John Williams' fantastic score The Imperial March to match. Sorry Rebel Scum, but Darth Vader is coming to kick ass and chew gum, and he's fresh out of gum. :) 4. Yoda - the necessary counterpoint to Vader's cruelty and evil. George Lucas again has drawn deeply from the well of Joseph Campbell to give us the wisest and most beloved teacher of all time. \"Do, or do not! There is no try!\" And the scene with Luke, Yoda and the X-Wing is perhaps the most magical in all of cinema. \"I don't believe it!?!\" \"That is why you fail!\" This amazing scene brings chills of rapture down my spine every time I watch it. 5. The mythology - here thanks to Yoda's teachings, contrasted by Darth Vader's brutality and the brief but insidious appearance of the Emperor, we truly learn the nature of the force, the dark side and the light. It is simple, yet profound enough to make us think seriously about the nature and of good and evil in our own world. We are reminded that good and evil are both choices, and that choices have consequences. That which is done, cannot be undone. \"Once you start down the dark path, forever will it dominate your destiny...\"6. Darth Vader's revelation to Luke: I won't spoil it even here, but this is THE greatest, most shocking, and most suspenseful cinematic revelation of all time. I don't think audiences today can ever appreciate how audiences in 1980 were left reeling by this fantastic scene, or the three years of debate and anticipation which followed - after so many triumphs in scene after scene, here The Empire Strikes Back truly claims its place in the pantheon of The Greatest Movies of All Time!Actually I could probably go on and on listing all the good parts of this movie, as every scene is a triumph. I think the above is a sufficient sampling to support my conclusion as to how incredible and deserving of its legendary status this movie is.The indifferent:1. Nothing about this movie is indifferent!The bad:1. Nothing is bad about this movie! Anyone who feels otherwise deserves to be banished to a dark oblivion forever by Great Chthulu. (Bonus points if you got that reference.) The only point I could make here is that this movie sets such a high standard of excellence in every respect that no subsequent Star Wars movie has been able to touch it.

It's become the go-to film when comparing film sequels in general. Though it's become an overused cliche to compare sequels to Empire, it's true. You can't really argue with the best of the best. A story of heroes on the run and the baddies closing in is still great especially when it's a space-opera that explores aspects on human spirituality.I could go on about why the film's great, why George Lucas made the least changes to this film in The Original Trilogy's Special Editions and why Empire was for a time the most successful independent movie ever made.

I could imagine the anticipation moviegoers had when the first sequel was released. Sequels rarely match or surpass the originals, but THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is considered the greatest sequels for good reason. Instead of rehashing the plot elements and formula from the first, it builds upon it, with more suspense and unexpected twists. Granted, in this case it was part of a lengthily saga that called for more than one movie to tell the entire story.Of the films from the original trilogy, RETURN OF THE JEDI has always been my personal favorite, but this one has a more compelling story with danger, excitement, solid character development, and the unexpected twists that would leave audiences anticipating more in the next installment.Luke's introduction to and training under Yoda has many iconic scenes and dialog. I was always amused when a swamp monster attempted to eat R2-D2 and then spit him out (\"Luckily you don't taste very good\"). Harrison Ford's performance as the cynical Han Solo is excellent as always. The romance that builds between him and Leia was entertaining. The best sequences were at the end, when Lando unwillingly sets up our heroes at the cloud city for Darth Vader. I like how C3PO is the first to become aware of it before the others do as well as the audience. I especially thought Lando's revelation to Leia and Han about Vader setting up a trap for Luke was well delivered. Luke's battle with Vader was epic and terrifying along with an iconic and frequently parodied revelation. His timely rescue by Leia and Landa foreshadowed another revelation for the following film.I can see why this has been a favorite among Star Wars fans.

I already pointed out that I won't be seeing Star Wars: The Last Jedi in a theater because Star Wars: The Force Awakens really disappointed me. The Force Awakens is perhaps the most shallow, uninspired piece of filmmaking that I've ever seen in my life. Actually, recently, I got a lot of enjoyment out of reading user reviews of The Force Awakens on IMDb. Almost all the popular reviews on IMDb gave this film a rating of one out of a possible ten stars. On the other hand, almost all paid film critics praised The Force Awakens when it was released. As some people pointed out, this shows that film critics working for popular newspapers and websites can't be trusted. They praised The Force Awakens because they were paid by Walt Disney Studios or because they were pressured. There is a word in the English language that describes this situation. It's corruption. What's interesting is that Disney has been pressuring movie theaters into showing The Last Jedi in all the largest auditoriums when the film will be released. In other words, it seems that Disney wants to make as much money as possible in as little time as possible with the release of The Last Jedi. Make of this what you will. Possibly, The Last Jedi is a disappointing film, just like The Force Awakens. Therefore, Disney wants to make as much money as possible before negative reviews by honest film critics begin appearing on the internet. I'm sure that The Last Jedi will be showered with overwhelming praise by paid film critics upon release, just like the awful The Force Awakens was. I'm not saying that The Last Jedi will be just as bad as The Force Awakens. Rian Johnson probably managed to make a better film than The Force Awakens. But it's possible, maybe probable, that The Last Jedi will also turn out to be a disappointment and a cash grab.Anyway, let's get back to the original trilogy. I've got to say that I was rather impressed by these three films, especially by The Empire Strikes Back. The visuals impressed me the most. I don't really think of Star Wars as science fiction. This is why I didn't include Star Wars films on my list of the best science fiction films. For me, these films are more like space fantasy or science fantasy. But the visuals of space and spaceships in these films are some of the best ever put to film. George Lucas created quite an imaginative world in Star Wars. There is no doubt that Lucas is a visionary. But, of course, Lucas grew up at a time when Americans were brought up to be inventive, capable, and original. For the last several decades, however, Americans have been brought up not to be inventive and knowledgeable but to be uninventive and obedient. Such is the policy of the capitalist American ruling class. Therefore, Americans don't really invent anything anymore and they can't come up with original ideas. I've seen the original Star Wars trilogy four times, I think. Now that I'm no longer a teenager, I realize that these three films are quite impressive pieces of filmmaking. The special effects are particularly impressive. But Lucas and company were also smart enough to bring in experienced British actors in order to make certain scenes more meaningful. As it turns out, many of the novels in the Star Wars Expanded Universe are worth reading too. I'm now reading Heir To The Empire, Deceived, and Darth Plagueis. What I should mention is that I'm not hating the new Star Wars films because I'm just a hater. I'm not obsessed with Star Wars, and I've never been a fan, but I still wanted these films to be good. Unfortunately, they're not good. They contain propaganda, just like the original trilogy did, but they are unoriginal corporate cash grabs.

It ended up being the highest-grossing film of all-time and it still ranks very high in the midst of today's blockbusters. It was a very enjoyable movie and it created memorable characters that will live on for eternity. So of course we would get a sequel. In fact, Lucas created a whole world around his baby -an ambition that was not normal in 1980. With the sequel-The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas handed the directorial duties to his former college film professor Irvin Kershner because of his duties with his rising visual effects company Industrial Light and Magic, but of course he was very involved with this film. But enough of the background, let's talk about this film. This sequel is much darker in tone, more mysterious, and quite frankly the best film in the franchise. Our favorite characters like Luke and Leia Skywalker and Han Solo are back and we are introduced to more characters that are stored away in our hearts forever such as Yoda and Lando Calrissian. This is also the movie where we have the famous battle and reveal between Luke and Darth Vader\u0085or shall I say between father and son, but more on that later.After the Rebels blow up the Death Star at the end of A New Hope, they hide away in the icy planet of Hoth. But the rebel base is soon discovered by Darth Vader (James Earl Jones and David Prowse) and the empire. From the battle that ensues, our characters are separated. Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) flee across the galaxy from the Empire. They end up going into Cloud City where they come across an old friend of Han's- Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). Meanwhile, Luke (Mark Hamill) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) are sent to the abandoned planet of Dagobath where he continues his Jedi training with an old Jedi master named Yoda (Frank Oz). But will they stay forgotten for long with Darth Vader relentlessly pursuing Luke across the galaxy? One of the biggest improvements over the original film is the visuals. While the visuals in the 1977 film were good for its time period, George Luca's new production company really improved upon the visuals. Along with the visuals, the film has strong production design and character design. I loved the look of Yoda, which was a puppet of course. You can tell the visuals were strong for a variety of reasons. There were the sights of the majestic Imperial Walkers during the battle of Hoth, the hairy sloth creature that attacks Luke after he gets lost on Hoth, the creepy, dense look of Dagobath, the spiral towers of Cloud City, and of course that lightsaber battle between Luke and Vader.SPOILER!! My highlight out of many of them is the revelation that happens near the end of the movie in Cloud City. I am sure most of you have seen the movie but if not, read no further. Darth Vader reveals to Luke during their intense duel that he is Luke's father, Anakin. Of course in the process, Vader chops of Luke's hand and he falls through a chute but is saved from falling to his death thanks to the Millennium Falcon. Also, the movie ends with Han Solo being captured by the Empire and frozen solid. So these events are just some of the reasons why this film is darker and more sinister than the space opera feel of the first film.The acting remains a strong point in the movie. Harrison Ford is excellent as always. I loved his \"wounded ego\" attitude and his bantering with Chewbacca added some lightheartedness to the movie. Yoda is my favorite new character. Not only did they want a realistic puppet, they actually wanted a good actor to bring that puppet to life. And Frank Oz did just that. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher remain excellent in their respective roles as Luke and Leia. And the voice of James Earl Jones? Well, the same magic that it always created! Need I say more? Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back is my favorite Star Wars movie, and frankly one of the best sci-fi films of all time. It really expanded upon the mystery and the lore the first film provided. The film explores its mythology in darker tones and that added depth and humanity to our characters. Lawrence Kasdan's and Leigh Brackett's screenplay took Lucas's world and created something that was evolutionary and breath-taking while staying true to its roots. The film ended on a sinister cliffhanger, so you bet we will be seeing a third film. The story and the visuals are fantastic, and now you can see why this is my favorite Star Wars film.My Grade: A+ \"No, I am your father!\" (Vader to Luke) \"Try not, Do, or do not!\" (Yoda to Luke)", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 2}, "heading": "My Favorite Star Wars Adventure!", "date": "2017-10-18T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3835456", "sentiment score": [0.0078, 0.0735, 0.267, 0.5643, 0.0875]}, {"content": "Empire has long been known as the greatest Star Wars flick. I would say that Return of the Jedi would have beaten it for this title, if it had laid off the overdose of ewoks and buffoonery that populate the middle of the film, and lose sight of the otherwise excellent and violent epic being told. Empire was actually the very first SW film I ever saw as a child. I saw it sitting on a library shelf and Empire looked the best to me for some reason, even on the box. I took it home and was thrilled to see the huge Hoth snow battle right to start with. From there, I already felt immersed in the SW universe, though I hadn't seen the original.( I had played with toys and heard about it from friends.)Great music, great script, great action, and the crazy revelation after a light saber duel of Vader being Luke's father. Plus, Billy Dee Williams!!! Interaction between the silly droids and Chewbacca(but still felt cool, and not as childish as prequel nonsense). I remember Han Solo's line really surprising me, as I was only in about 2nd grade, when he replies to Leah's \"I love you,\" with \"I know\", as I had never heard anyone say this in a movie. I was expecting the usual \"I love you too.\" It seems silly now, but for the time, Empire had some witty and sarcastic moments that are way better than other entries in the saga. Landing in a monster's mouth while running from the Empire through an asteroid field? Awesome, and the music and tension with that scenery are forever etched into my brain. John William is awesome.

Darth Vader and Chewbacca got to really shine in this movie and were infinitely better than in the predecessor. also Yoda was introduced and he was fine i guess. 3. the action: thankfully this movie didn't have a lot of storm-trooper shootout scenes. this is probably the biggest improvement over the last movie. the last movie had very boring action with no stakes since the storm-troopers literally miss every shot they take. here we only had one storm-trooper shootout and it was pretty quick. summary: fine movie. better than the last one but still grossly overrated. the biggest problem with these movies is that they are in the middle of kids movies and adult sci-fi", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Improved but not perfect", "date": "2017-10-10T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3827968", "sentiment score": [0.0042, 0.1095, 0.6574, 0.2234, 0.0054]}, {"content": "Anticipation...Star Wars Fans Waited Three Years for the Follow Up and were Not Disappointed.

Episode IV's introduction to George Lucas' world of aliens, droids and intergalactic war struck a chord with audiences back in 1977, and continues to do so today. It is a fun good vs. evil story that only touches upon the spiritual elements of the 'Force' that we now know so well, and on the vastness of the universe it is set within. Personally, I have to agree with Dante's argument that Empire offers a darker and richer experience, which not only develops the series' mythology even further, but paints its characters with far more layers than seen before.We no doubt have George Lucas' lack of involvement in the film's development for that, as the witty script by Leigh Bracket and Raiders of the Lost Ark scribe Lawrence Kasdan keeps the action both exciting and with consequence, as well as maintaining a firm grasp on the characters' complicated relationships and personal roles in the expanding story. Director Irvin Kershner, who took over after Lucas bailed following a troubled pre-production, also brings the best out of the actors. Empire really transformed what was an interesting idea drawing inspiration from classic sci-fi serials and the samurai films of Akira Kurosawa into the billion-dollar beast it is today. These films are now so deeply rooted in our culture that it's almost difficult to classify the original trilogy as mere movies, they have now become something else entirely.After succeeding in blowing up the Empire's planet-destroying Death Star, the Rebels, led by Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), are hiding out on ice planet Hoth while the evil Darth Vader sends out trackers throughout the galaxy in the hope of tracking them down. Smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford) wants to repair his ship and get back to his old ways with trusted Wookiee friend Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), but that doesn't prevent him from flirting with Leia (Carrie Fisher). When they are eventually spotted and the planet is attacked, the film does what most sequels do nowadays and splits everybody up. Han and Leia must escape through an asteroid field with the Empire in pursuit to seek refuge in Cloud City with old friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), while Luke seeks out Dagobah to learn the ways of the Force from Jedi master Yoda (Frank Oz).Even though I have seen this movie countless times, the arm hairs still stand up when John Williams' fantastic score kicks in during the opening crawl. From the on, Empire delivers a relentless assault of riveting set-pieces and iconic moments, from the attack on Hoth which still stands up to most modern blockbusters, to the gob- smacking twist at the climax now so routinely, and lovingly, spoofed. It also takes Darth Vader to a new level of villainy, as the helmeted Sith lord relentlessly pursues the young man he feels is strong in the ways of the Force, and brutally takes out any of his own underlings who make the mistake of failing him. It's certainly dark, but it's easy to forget just how exciting and engrossing it is also. Ending at an incredibly low point for most of the good guys involved with only a sliver of hope on the horizon, I can't imagine how much fans were left wanting more back in 1980 as the credits rolled. It will always be superior to A New Hope in my book, but you can't have one without the other, and both are damn near perfect.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Trumps A New Hope, but both a damn near perfect", "date": "2017-07-30T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3768622", "sentiment score": [0.0045, 0.0436, 0.3177, 0.588, 0.0462]}, {"content": "What can I say about this movie that hasn't already been said. Episode V is arguably the best in the series. The acting of Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Harrison Ford (Han Solo), and Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia) is superb. For a film from 1980 it still holds up extremely well. Perhaps this is due to George Lucas' writing, Irvin Kershner's directing, or John William's score. Most likely it's a combination of all three.The Empire Strikes Back is a markedly darker film than its predecessor or its successor. However, this is not a bad thing. The theme of darkness runs though out much of the movie. Any film where the bad guys win could easily have this theme just for that reason alone. The Empire Strikes Back does so much more though.Through the whole movie Han, Leia, and crew are on the run from the evil Empire. This makes the contrasting burgeoning love between Han and Leia so much more powerful. Two people who find a connection in dark times is a common theme, but in this film, it's not overdone. It's subtle and hints at their connection until the end. Luke also has his own darkness. On Dagobah, Luke trains to become a Jedi, like his father before him. However, shortly after finding Yoda, Luke encounters the cave where he sees and does battle with Darth Vader if only in his own mind. It turns out that he is facing the darkness in himself. This is really telling of the dark theme of the movie.Even the lighting of the movie adds to the theme. There aren't many bright scenes in this movie and even when there is, there is a looming sense of doom. In the beginning during the assault on Hoth, the planet may be bright and white, but we quickly find that the Empire has found them and will be attacking soon. Dagobah is a dark and foggy world full of mystery which matches the mystery behind the Jedi well. Cloud City on Bespin is almost lit like twilight and we learn that it is under the control of the Empire.The music and sound also contribute to the dark theme. Who can deny that the ominous sound of Darth Vader's breathing or amazing orchestrated music are responsible for much of the feelings we get in the movie. This film just wouldn't be the same without all of the work done by the sound engineers and music composers.

Whereas A New Hope seemed a little more shaky and adventurous, Empire exhumed total confidence, it explained more e.g. Vader being Luke's father, introduced the character of Yoda that had so far been a missing link in the story, it explained more about the great purge that had consumed the galaxy, what the galaxy had been like before the Empire through Obi-Wan and Yoda's eyes......It answered a lot of questions basically.The backdrops e.g. the locations, space itself, were kept in a similar vain to the previous film; dirty, desolate, it gave the impression that our heroes were truly lost out in the farthest reaches of the galaxy.

One would think seeing dead people is enough but no. Along with seeing and talking to dead folks we also follow the wise tutelage of talking green puppets ( honestly is Yoda what Kermit will look like in the year 2689?)I wish it was over but there is more hot air to come.

The first half of the film focuses on those battles, primarily featuring Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher).

A recent watching confirmed this. I think the \"trouble\" stems from the fact that \"Empire\" is much more of an action film than a drama. Whereas \"New Hope\" was so incredibly genre-diverse, \"Empire\" takes that same cast of characters and instead relies a bit too much on laser blasts and space maneuvers. It doesn't help that certain scenes (inside the \"asteroid\"; Lando's scenes) just feel a little draggy...like filler.Overall, though, this is still a very watchable film that keeps the main storyline pushing forward.

You've heard it before, people telling you it's the best because \"the ending is so dark\". While I do think this is the best film out of the series, I don't agree with that reason. I think the movie is dark as the result of what actually makes the movie so great. I will attempt to explain my point of view.In A New Hope our heroes were part of a story that was bigger then them. It was about the Empire trying to wipe out the Rebel Alliance. In contrast the story of Empire Strikes Back is driven by the characters. The Rebels are still trying to free the universe from the Empire, it's just not the main story anymore. It's the backdrop of the story. The real story is Darth Vader's obsession with turning Luke Skywalker to the Dark Side. That is the driving force behind everything that happens in this film and suddenly the story is much more personal for our heroes.This of course ends up giving a fantastic character arc for Luke, something that was missing from Episode IV. The heroic and hopeful Skywalker gets put through the wringer and by the end of the movie everything he believes in is now in question. It also leads up to one of the most memorable twists in movie history (which brings into question what order you should be watching these films).Not to be left out though, and maybe something that goes overlooked by some, but Leia and Han have great character arcs as well. The incredibly self-reliant Princess is left emotionally vulnerable while Solo goes from self-serving to selfless. It's done so well you won't notice until it's too late. Of course this also leads up to one of the most memorable cliffhangers in movie history.Character driven story. Great character arcs. One of the greatest twists and cliffhangers in movie history.

She shoots her gun a couple times, but for the most part she is the object of Luke and Han's attraction. Like one of the biggest characters in the entire series does nothing for an entire film.Mark Hamill really could've taken some acting lessons before taking Jedi training with Yoda. When Vader says \"Luke I am your father\" Mark's reaction to it is hilariously cheesy and bad. I lol'd. Also - the yoda training scenes, so many unintentionally funny moments.There were lots of times in the plot where I had no clue why anyone was doing what they were doing. Couldn't figure out the motivations for large chunks of the film. Like why don't the fliers go out in their planes to get Luke when he was out in the snow? And instead they let Han Solo do it? They are valuable assets to the rebels and would likely freeze to death. Why doesn't Vader just go to the Yoda planet and find Luke there? Or Kill Yoda? Jedi problem over.Anyway, the film is beautiful. Technically I'm sure it was innovative for its time. Sure parts are a bit dated, but I like the journey it takes.

During one of the many interviews George Lucas gave for this doc, he remembered the huge deal of pressure he had to bear on his shoulders while filming Empire Strikes back.He produced it with his own money he earned thanks to the huge success of the first movie as he wanted to keep his independence from the big studios. The fans had also a lot of expectations about the upcoming movie so George Lucas wanted it the same level if not better than A new hope. And it is.While a new hope was focused on this small band of young people and their struggle to destroy a devastating weapon of mass destruction, Lucas has dedicated this movie into developing each one of the characters as well as the relationship between them with its lot of surprises. That famous scene when Luke learns the terrible truth about his father's fate is one of them and to me this is the knockout moment of Empire.The other big novelty is this romance between Han and Leia. It's a great addition to the story line which allows us to discover another entirely hidden side of both of them. It's fun and sweet to see them teasing at each other. It adds some lightness too in a very dark plot.We are also introduced to three main new characters who are part of the Star Wars Legacy: Yoda, The Emperor and Lando Calrisian. There's no need to introduce Yoda, the cunning and wise Jedi master, who is maybe small by this height but awesomely powerful with the Force. In the first movie, Obi-Wan introduced us to this powerful invisible superpower but Yoda is the one who tells everything about it while we follow Luke in his Jedi Training. He shows us the true meaning of the Force. This was what made this character so important to the general story. About the Emperor, even if we don't see much of him in Empire, we understand that he's the main villain of the story and that in fact Darth Vader is one of his victims.Of course we still see a lot of epic combat scenes like the Battle of Hoth with those imperial walkers advancing towards the rebel base, the pursuit in the asteroid field or of course the duel on Bespin between Luke and Vader which climaxed with the surprising revelation of Darth Vader to his son.All of those made this movie incredibly awesome.

Irvin Kershner at the time was an interesting choice as the director to the sequel of on of the biggest movies ever made, but what a fantastic choice is was. The reason why choosing Kershner as director was so brilliant was because of his background in film making. His films were much character driven with lots of emotion and heart to them, nothing that twas at the scale of Star Wars . Characters are ultimately what make Star Wars so great, its the attention to detail, wit, charm and interactions that make them so enjoyable to watch. Irvin not only delivers on this he excels and produces a Star Wars film that no one could have predicted. This film has such a good contrast between the shots in this film, however neither one carries the film more than the other. From the huge opening on Hoth to the more intimate moments between Han and Leia this never misses a beat. Next the story which is much much darker than the original film, and doesn't it work brilliantly with the subject matter at hand. The story has the rebellion on the run from there victory against the death star and they have been chased across the galaxy, the desolate world shows how desperate the rebels are. The story does has a lot of these small things that add up to one big overall theme of desperation and fear that holds you throughout the film. Which adds to the tension that know of the characters are safe form danger and that any one of them could killed any minute, fantastic tension builder. More broadly this film is dark,complex,interesting and rich. Not only does this film hit its infamous special effect action scenes but also knocks out of the park its emotion story line as well, a truly iconic film and story. If you thought that the groundbreaking special effects in Star Wars were amazing the sequel to that film somehow managed to better it. The opening battle on Hoth is one of cinemas greatest openings to a film and never lets down. The effects still to this day hold up and are a thrill to watch, it really shows the scope of this film. Ever single effect in this film doesn't look out of this place and adds an element of wonder at times and also horror, which is extremely effective in the scenes.There are two final positives of the film, firstly the performances in the film are brilliant. Needless to say that all of the returning cast are really good and also build on their characters from the first film. Not surprising there are two characters that have more of an impact in this film than others and those characters are Luke and Vader. From the training with Yoda to the showdown with Vader at the end of the film, Mark Hamill delivers a more mature aspect to the character who is ready to make the transition from rebel to Jedi. He also shows the physicality to match the change as well never showing physical weakness throughout the film. Vader, in the first film he was just the villain of the film and not much more. This film however elevates Vader to a new level and shows much more depth to the character that he was missing in the first film. He is everything he is in the first and more much much more. Oh yeah and he is Luke's father.......Oh spoiler alert for If you've been living under a rock, to be fair if you watch films 1 to 6 you already know that anyway before you reach 5. The film positive is once again the score by John Williams which is perfection, the score in this film adds so much in every scene no matter how small or big the scene is there is always a memorable theme to it through the score. Finally this film is the best Star Wars film and in my opinion wouldn't ever be beaten, 90 out of 100% a true icon of cinema and the best sequel in history.

This first battle is incredible, we feel the scale and power of the empire from all perspectives making you realise just how powerful they really are and how much the Rebel Alliance are up against. When we get past this battle the film is split into two separate arcs that are cut together and told perfectly, there's never a moment we're the audience is bored with either story as the characters along with the storytelling make both of them just as entertaining and satisfying as each other. Luke's time on Dagobah is incredibly intriguing, the way this film talks about the Jedi and The Force is extremely well done it makes them seem more deeper than mere warriors and the inclusion of Jedi Master Yoda was a very good way of emphasising this as it shows the enlightenment The Force can bring. The other arc of this movie cantering around Han Solo and Princess Leia on the run from the empire is extremely entertaining with seamless special effects and a much more intimate and character driven story than the previous instalment, the romance that eventually develops is done just right it feels natural as well as not forced and the chemistry between the two is impeccable. When we finally get to the last act of this film it's all come together perfectly to create for a nail baiting final show down. The fight between Darth Vader and Luke is absolutely incredible, not only the mental but physical war that goes on between the two is so satisfying, the famous reveal doesn't see out of field but plausible and the ending was not entirely satisfactory as it left the characters in a questionable position that sets up for a better place for a sequel.

In \"The Empire Strikes Back\", the key word is \"Back\". Now, take the most hardcore \"Star Wars\" fan -I think there's a name for them, and I guess I would know if I were one- and take someone who doesn't care much about the series, now, ask the pair to list four or five classic \"Star Wars\" moments, I bet a good half of the scenes will belong to the glorious episode V \"The Empire Strikes Back\", directed by Irvin Keshner (and George Lucas as the Executive Producer). By the way, do you know the joke, why did Lucas start \"Star Wars\" with the 4th, 5th and 6th episodes and then made the first three? Because Master Yoda directed them (punch line drum sound). Well, that's just to show you I didn't use the word 'sequel', and this is not because I don't want to offend sensitivities, but because I don't take the film as a sequel but as the real journey into the soul of \"Star Wars\", the dark side, literally.It is in this film that the relationship between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) transcends the limits of the simple crush, the interactions between them are really catching and you can tell that Harrison Ford challenges his character, and has fun teasing the little Princess who's not insensitive to his charm. A film where actors have fun playing their characters can't turn bad, and it is a credit to the directing for having made the romance efficient with no more than three or four scenes. And they all culminate with one of the most touching declarations of love, touching because of its laconic but sincere answer\u0085 you know. \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is also the film that pursues the coming-of-age of Luke Skywalker and features his initiation by Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz). Obi-Wan was a great character but Yoda has everything, the speech mannerism, the mimics and this little quality that makes him like the perfect crossover between Mr. Myagi and \"E.T.\" except that he came the first. Yoda is the heart of the story, and when he warns Luke about the dark side of the Force, he knows exactly where he's heading to, and I guess ever since \"Star Wars\" ended, the audience knew what the next film had to deliver. Which leads to the one true reason-to-be of the film, the climactic light-saber battle between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker right after having plunged us into the evil Empire Lord's psyche and revealed the Shakespearian truth about his identity. Now, is it really a spoiler to spoil it or is it a of prescription case? In a Simpson episode from the third season, which means 1992, a gag consisted on Homer leaving the theater and spoiling the ending to all the lining up moviegoers. So after one decade, \"The Empire Strikes Back\" was already part of cinema's history. I guess you can't call yourself a movie lover but if you don't know Vito Corleone, Scarlett O'Hara or the father of Luke Skywalker, well it kind of shades off to ignorance. Indeed, \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is like the second tome of Homer's Odyssey, it is an inevitable and valuable portion of Cinema's history regarding perhaps the one true myth that solely belongs to the silver screen. And it is for this achievement that it's impossible not to recognize the cinematic value of \"The Empire Strikes Back\". Say what you want about the creatures, the special effects, the little gimmick or childish moments, but when the film starts and you have in order, the 'Fox' logo, the 'long time go' title card-and then the first pumping sound of the triumphant fanfare, something melts inside you and you're like a child who just sat on the roller- coaster. \"The Empire Strikes Back\" was the most anticipated movie, the follow-up to the all time most popular film and it managed to become more popular by injecting novelty within the relationships and add new characters such as Yoda or Lando (Billy Dee Williams). It even managed to equal the original by having its own score: \"The Imperial March\", as if it had to have its own existence independently from the first, and it's fitting that the score is about the villain as Darth Vader seems more majestic and frightening in this opus, actually he was nominated #3 in the AFI's Top 50 villains but it was the Darth Vader from \"Empire\", the one with the Imperial March. Even Vader raises its iconic status with his (temporary) victory over the rebels. Because that's also what characterizes the film, the bad guys have the upper hand. It concludes with a frozen Han Solo, an amputated Luke with the painful knowledge about his origins, a disintegrated C3PO and so on\u0085 a cliffhanger so obvious it doesn't even need the obligatory \"to be continued\", we know the fight between evil and good isn't over. I guess at that moment, \"The Return of the Jedi\" immediately became the most anticipated cinematic project.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "The \"heart\" of the \"Star Wars\" trilogy...", "date": "2016-10-04T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3555978", "sentiment score": [0.0085, 0.0586, 0.2625, 0.5661, 0.1042]}, {"content": "Empire Strikes Back is the prime example of how to do a movie sequel; it furthers the story,raises the stakes, expands the characters and universe, goes in daring new directions, improves the technicals and fixes any of the flaws found in the previous film.

This is the movie that turned \"Star Wars\" from what was at the time little more than a soap opera in space into one of the greatest sagas in all of fiction. Its characters are diverse and well developed, its storytelling is magical, its effects are groundbreaking, its world-building is perfection, its allegories to classical literature and world mythology are brilliant. It is to science fantasy (And American cinema in general) what \"The Odyssey\" was to literature.\"Empire\" does an excellent job maintaining a dark, suspenseful tone throughout its run-time; from Luke's narrow escape from the cave of the vicious Wampa to the Millennium Falcon navigating through a perilous asteroid field (And a space slug) to escape certain doom at the hands of Imperial TIE fighters, to Han suffering a devastating betrayal at the hands of a close friend, \"Empire\" is a movie that constantly has you on the edge of your seat. Of course, the most suspenseful, intense scene of the movie has to be the lightsaber duel on Bespin between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader. The eerie lack of music, the dark, atmospheric lighting (The fact that we are mostly seeing the combatants lightsabers and not their actual motions only adds to the suspense) and the emotion driven, \"brute force\" fighting style of the combatants make the duel almost impossible to take your eyes off of. Without spoiling anything the shocking, powerful conclusion to the duel is what seals it as one of the best fights in film history. Its conclusion, while tragic, is oddly sentimental; Vader's vicious dismemberment of Luke is what oddly brings them closer together from a perspective of empathy and understanding.This is a film that takes countless risks, something that I have nothing but respect for. Nothing is sugarcoated. True, the film is not without its fair share of comedic moments (A good thing, as they're quite charming and always elicit at the very least wide smiles if not full on laughs), but this is a very different movie than the lighthearted, cheesefest that \"A New Hope\" was. If anything, \"Episode V\" was the movie that proved that the Star Wars saga was indeed capable of true tonal diversity. \"Empire\" is a movie about the destruction of hope, about fear clouding the judgment of good people with devastating and tragic consequences. These themes are excellently conveyed through the development of Luke, Han and even Darth Vader, whose arc simultaneously concludes in both total victory and crushing, emotional loss. Vader is proof that you don't need an endless supply of dialogue to make your mark as a complex, fascinating character.The acting is (For the most part) really impressive. Mark Hamill's performance as Luke Skywalker is vastly improved from his fairly uninspired showing in A New Hope. True, he has his whiny and petty moments (And not all of them are justified), but this is actually quite important in making Luke flawed, human and relatable. If Luke started out as a morally flawless superman liked by everyone who makes all the right decisions, he would lose his humanity and relatability as a character. How tragic it is that his ethic and ambition are rewarded by the world-shattering revelation of his greatest hero's corruption?Frank Oz does phenomenal voice work as Yoda, bringing depth and complexity to a character that could have very easily been a cheap \"Merlin\" ripoff. Not only does he bring a nuanced wisdom to the role of Yoda, Oz also has fantastic comedic timing that never feels out of character. Yoda is a somewhat insignificant and pathetic looking creature in both physical appearance and mannerisms, but he uses this meekness in appearance and voice to test Luke's compassion and patience. What makes him such a great mentor and wise master is that he does not train his students bodies (Which he refers to as \"crude matter.) He trains their will power. Their minds. Their morality. Also, that green Henson puppet looks just as real today as it did 36 years ago when it first waddled across Dagobah.Hands down, the best performance in the movie, and perhaps the entire original trilogy, has to go to James Earl Jones as Darth Vader. Vader is blessed with more screen time here than he was given in \"A New Hope\", as well as better writing. This is a blessing Jones makes the absolute most of. Not only did he send chills down my spine with the passion and cold intensity of his ruthlessness, his nuance in showing Vader's repressed humanity and depression is done with the skill and subtlety of, for lack of a better term, a master. Earl Jones's phenomenal voice acting commands complete attention every time Vader appears on screen.Even decades after its initial release, \"Empire Strikes Back\" has easily the best special effects in the franchise. Not only were the animatronics, costume, makeup and set design and digital effects revolutionary for the time, not only are they made with unmatched detail, they still look shockingly realistic to this very day. Even ignoring the effects, the visual storytelling as a whole is exceptional. The warmer and more airy aesthetic of A New Hope is replaced with a darker and filthier visual style. The film frequently plays up the paradoxical interplay of organic and industrial imagery, almost like a \"Tetsuo\" Lite at times. The harsh reds, deep blues and swamp greens of the color scheme subconsciously tell us that we have left the safeness, comfort and familiarity of A New Hope for a world far more hostile, demanding, gritty, expansive and violent.I could go on and on about everything \"Empire\" does perfectly. Not only is it a phenomenal film, it's a revolution of Sci-Fantasy filmmaking and, in my opinion, the best movie of the 1980s. It is our generations equivalent to what ancient Greeks must have felt reading the classical works of Homer.

He sends out probes that find the Rebel Base on the Ice world of Hoth.On Hoth, Luke Skywalker is out on patrol, when he is attacked by a Wampa, a big snow creature, and Han Solo goes out looking for him. Luke, who in the four years since A New Hope has been training himself in the ways of the Jedi, manages to defeat the Wampa with his lightsaber. Luke runs away from the Wampa's cave and after a while, he collapses in the snow and sees a vision of Obi-Wan, now a ghost. He tells Luke to complete his training with Jedi Master Yoda on Dagobah. Then Han Solo arrives and they are rescued by a Rebel Scout in a Snowspeeder.The Empire arrives on Hoth in their terrifying AT-ATs (All Terrain Attack Transport) and the Battle of Hoth begins. This is one of the best moments of the original trilogy.After the Battle, Han Solo, Chewbacca, Princess Leia and C-3PO go in the Millennium Falcon trying to outrun the Empire, whilst Luke and R2-D2 head to Dagobah in their X-Wing.On Dagobah, we meet Yoda. Yoda is wise, strong and powerful. Everything a Jedi should be. He appears to be weak and old. We judge him by how small he is and so does Luke. Then we have that iconic moment when Yoda lifts Luke's X-Wing out of the swamp.Meanwhile, Darth Vader hires several bounty hunters to capture Han Solo and the Millennium Falcon. It is here when we are introduced to legendary bounty hunter Boba Fett (Unless you watch Attack of the Clones before this or the special edition version of A New Hope from 1997). Han decides to go to the planet Bespin, where his old friend Lando Calrissian, who is the Administrator of Cloud City, lives. But Lando has had to sell Han out to Vader, who is already in Cloud City because Boba Fett has been tracking the Millennium Falcon in his ship, Slave 1.Luke senses his friends are in danger and decides to leave, but Yoda tells him he isn't ready and that it is a trap to lure him there. Luke leaves anyway.Back on Bespin, Vader uses a carbonite freezing chamber to freeze Han Solo, so that Boba Fett can deliver him to Jabba the Hutt. Lando explains to Leia and Chewbacca that he had to sell them out in order for Cloud City to be safe from the Empire. They understand (maybe not Chewbacca) and they try to free Han, but they fail.Luke arrives and has an epic lightsaber duel with him that ends in a shocking revelation....(not so shocking if you've seen the prequels before hand)The addition of Yoda and Lando are great and Vader gets a larger role.

That is something that makes the original trilogy better in my opinion because in the prequels it was focused on showing us heavily C.G.I. visuals ratter then on the characters. This is one of many factors that make the original trilogy by far the superior films. The plot is also more complex then the first of this trilogy which shows that the people involved with this project were taking risks. The characters were all likable and interesting. And the fact that they filmed at real locations shows dedication from the director Irvin Kershner.The cons of this picture though are not minimal which leads me to feeling as though it is grossly overrated. The acting and dialogue is still hooky, the effects are showing age, the action is underwhelming, and unfortunately the fan base that surrounds Star Wars has made it difficult to watch Empire as it was intended.

I love this film to death, it is my second favorite film and the best sequel in the Star Wars franchise that I love. The Empire Strikes Back is a movie that it is one of the best sequels I can think of, it is right there with Aliens (1986), it is right there with Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) it is an excellent sequel and it really does establish The Empire as a value treat. Empire Strikes Back is still and excellent film which I really believe is a timeless classic. This is my second favorite film from director Irvin Kershner. Number 1 favorite Irvin Kershner film will be RoboCop 2 (1990) which is very underrated action flick. I still have to review those movies someday.Empire Strikes Back (1980) is the best one of the series, because it's deeper, darker, more philosophical. It's great because Darth Vader and the Empire are at their most menacing, the direction is creative, the characters feel real, the nature of the Force is explored more without losing its mysticism, and the pacing is, as George Lucas would put it, faster and more intense than any other film in the saga.The plot is actually more a rescue mission that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is coming to rescue his friends Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO and Chewbacca are captured on a planet Bespin in Cloud City from villainous Darth Vader. Han Solo's friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) set the up and with Darth Vader he set a trap for Luke. Also Luke studied the Force under Jedi Master Yoda to become a full Jedi Knight but in the end he must confront Darth Vader (David Prowse) by him self. The origins of Luke Skywalker are reveled.Empire Strikes Back was released in 1980 it is directed by Irvin Kershner this time and not George Lucas. Because George Lucas decide that he want to make this sequel independent one, so he ended up coming with his own, founding for the film. Getting a loan and money he earn from the first movie and it success, so he decided he wanted, to found the film him self, and he wanted to be more an executive producer to keep an eye on the lamp, he moved to a bigger studio in Orange County, California, so he diced to be more a producer he did not want to direct Empire Strikes Back. So his first choice was Irvin Kershner, who was a professor at UC in the UC film school, that George attended too and he always liked Irvin Kershner and of course he was a former professor and it was a hard way talk him to do it and the first time Irvin Kershner didn't want to do it, so George called Irvin's agent and his agent said to Irvin take it so he did and the rest is a history. This stands the test of time, the best film he ever directed! I love John Williams score still the same, but I think John Williams changed the music score for a little bit, but that's just my opinion.Things that I love in this film: I love the battle with Rebels fighting with the Imperial AT-AT walkers on the ice world of Hoth. That is my favorite scene on ice world in the film. The Imperial AT-AT walkers are incredible well made with classic special effects.I love that the origins of Luke Skywalker are reveled, that Luke is the son of Darth Vader, who is actually Anakin Skywalker, before he become Darth Vader and went to the dark site.For the first time ever, we see an Emperor in a Hologram talking to Darth Vader.The Falcon with Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO and Chewbacca hiding in the rocks try's to eat a monster.Luke faces with Darth Vader him self face to face and get his arm cut off and then he jumps off the bridge, because he didn't want to join his father in a dark force. The lightsaber duel throughout the chamber between Luke and Darth Vader was excellent and it was epic.The training sequence with Luke and master Yoda were excellent and epic.

It's pretty cool.The story is also not as fleshed out as the first one, even though it did introduce my personal favourite character Yoda as well as Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian, who is also pretty cool. The only thing done better than the first one in this film is the plot twist, when Darth Vader says that he is his dad, which while I wasn't expecting it, I wasn't really blown away by it, I just thought that it was fitting.The creativeness is still there, with the team meeting all new different and imaginative aliens and robots. I already talked about Yoda, but we also see Emperor Palpatine for the first time, even if it is for just one scene.Overall, The Empire Strikes Back, is not as exciting, clever or creative as Star Wars, but it's still engaging enough in its own right to count as very entertaining cinema.The Empire Strikes Back: 7.4/10", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 5}, "heading": "7.4/10 Easily Irvin Keshner's best film, even if it isn't as good as the original, or as innovative", "date": "2016-04-24T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3457251", "sentiment score": [0.0013, 0.008, 0.0846, 0.8697, 0.0365]}, {"content": "Who would have thought that this would be the greatest film and sequel ever made?

It was directed by Irvin Kershner over 35 years ago and had some success with the Academy Awards, even if not nearly as much as the first film. And I myself must say that I found it not better than the first (even if the IMDb rating says so), but also not much worse. Once again, it delivers especially on the visual side in terms of sets, cinematography and special effects while coming a bit short in terms of the story. The characters are all fairly memorable though, the humans and the others. There are many many characters that appeared in the first film already, for example Obi Wan Kenobi is even back for one scene, but there are also some interesting new additions, most of all the uber-famous Yoda. And Darth Vader is the main villain in here while being just one of several villains in the first film. A great light saber sequence is included here too.I said that I was not too overwhelmed by the story and that implies the plot as a whole, but also minor scenes and references. One example would be Calrissian's character obviously being totally scared of Vader for almost the entire film and then, completely out of nowhere, he suddenly has no fear anymore and joins the resistance fighters. Not very realistic character development. I also did not like the references in terms of mathematical probability early on. This makes it look really unrealistic that Skywalker survived or that Han Solo managed to control the spacecraft some time later.All in all, it was an okay watch at best and the film has several lengths, starts off nicely with the snow planet scenes, gets worse, but gains some momentum again towards the end. However, I believe that they could have done without roughly 20 minutes and kept this movie at 105 minutes instead of over two hours. You have to be very generous to appreciate this film as a whole as there were more than just a few weaknesses to it.

The final result was (and is) a fantastic movie, arguably the best sequel ever in this kind of cinematic experience. As Lucas left the writing job to his fellow storyteller Lawrence Kasdan (very possibly the real mastermind behind the most amusing lines, considering the awful job Lucas did all alone with the prequels), the adventure is just as iconic as \"A New Hope\", but with a darker and somewhat more mature mood, as the title suggests. If \"Star Wars\" was an epic poem, and in some ways it is, this film should be considered its \"discentio ad inferos\", that is the lowest moment for the hero, who then rises from its ashes and manages to win once and for all (\"Return of the Jedi\"): both Han Solo and Luke Skywalker find themselves in great danger at the hands of Darth Vader, a character that immediately grows in depth after one of the last scenes, which is also one of the most famous scenes (and worst quoted lines) in the history of cinema and possibly the best idea to come from George Lucas's mind. One possible mistake could have been to recycle our beloved characters in cheap fashion, but instead everyone of them grows and gets more defined through the story and we are introduced to yet some other iconic members of this wonderful universe, like Master Yoda, Lando Calrissian and the baddest bounty hunter ever, Boba Fett.

Its end shows Luke, the protagonist flying with R2-D2 to Dagobah, to find Yoda while Han, Leia, C-3PO and Chewie escape from the Imperial troops.The training sequences at Dagobah are one of my favorites since Yoda is such an interesting character who Frank Oz voiced humorously. As for the rest of the gang, the scenes inside the monster were funny and romantic courtesy of the one and only Han Solo.The escape to Cloud City where they meet Lando, Han's old friend, and the CGI there is fantastic. Lando's sweet-talking was one of the film's best bits along with Harrison Ford's charisma.Meanwhile, the mysterious Emperor reveals to Darth Vader that Luke is Anakin Skywalker's son and Luke decides to stop his stop his training and go to Cloud City, to save Han and Leia,who might be in danger.After that, the third act is legendary. The duel between and Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker is one of the sagas's best moments, not to forget Han's epic 'I Know' response to Leia's 'I Love You'The pacing is OK, but might feel a bit slow if noticed or bored, which is impossible. Also, the fun and light tone of the previous film is completely lacking compared but is expertly replaced by the suspenseful plot line.However, the ending MAY be a bit daft due to the fact that it isn't a complete conclusion and is kind of a cliff-hangar ending.As for the performances, James Earl Jones and Frank Oz's voice acting for Vader and Yoda respectively is really good, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill were satisfactory, Anthony Daniels was hilarious as C-3PO.But the best of all was Harrison Ford as Han Solo, the epitome of cool, whose charisma and rugged good looks enough to make girls swoon were some of few great qualities that made him the film's best character and performer.

Directed by Irvin Kershner and seeing the return of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher, The Empire Strikes back is considered by many to be the greatest film in the Star Wars saga, me included, and here is why I myself love it.Right away we are thrown back into the mix, not all too long after where we left off at the end of Star Wars, Darth Vader is determined to find Luke and, even after a huge defeat, their huge power is still apparent as the Empire's stretch reaches all corners of the galaxy. The title is very fitting for a film like this, the enemy are going to get their revenge with everything they get. The dark side has never been as threatening as it was in this film. One of best parts about this film is how dark it is, after a fairly safe first episode we get to see our heroes pushed to their limit and put in very dark places. They separate, they are tricked and by the end of the film you could say they were defeated. This is what makes Empire Strikes Back so emotionally investing and powerful.One thing I didn't like about Star Wars were the visuals and colour pallet, don't get me wrong the special effects and models were fantastic but I just didn't like how it looked as a whole, but I have to say this film looked gorgeous, the dark blacks and blues that symbolise the dark side's influence and the film's tone in general. The model and effects work again was absolutely stunning, the battle of Hoth is still mind-blowing to this day. Cloud city looks moody yet beautiful displaying how even a place as gorgeous as this isn't safe. The final confrontation between Luke and Vader with the strong colours and the dark lighting made for one of the best looking scenes in the entire saga.The previously mediocre acting evolved into some convincing and excellent performances this time around. The characters were now a lot more attached to each other leading to a better chemistry between them and some great scenes ranging from emotional, funny and action packed. Every line is memorable and brilliantly delivered, making the already fantastic dialogue even better.The scenes on Dagobah with Yoda are magical, beautiful yet dark, hopeful yet brooding. The dialogues and monologues are at its highest points here, lines like \"Luminous beings are we, not this crude matter\" and \"What's in there?\" \"Only what you take with you\" are the kind of memorable lines that stay with you for life. Yoda himself is a wonder of puppetry, being so emotive with such an extraordinary personality while only being a rubber puppet is real feat and they pull it off expertly, making one of the most classic characters in the entirety of cinema.Overall The Empire Strikes back is not only the best Star Wars film but one of the best sci-fi films of all time, dark and beautiful, the heroes are pushed and tested right to their breaking point and pretty much being the loser by the end of this film was a really bold move and it paid off. Its dark atmosphere made for some tense moments of conflict both personal relationships and large scale battles that will have you on the edge of your seat as you become completely captivated in such a unique and interesting universe that seems to have no end to what could be in store.

Regarded by many as the best chapter of the whole saga and memorable for its unforgettable final twist that no one saw coming, The Empire Strikes Back does feature a more involving storyline but thanks to its marred visuals, this was just as difficult to take seriously as its predecessor.Set three years after the events of A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back continues the story of Luke Skywalker who travels to a desolate planet to study the Force & receive advanced Jedi training from Jedi Master Yoda. Meanwhile, the Galactic Empire makes a vicious comeback against the Rebel Alliance, overpowering & driving the rebel forces from their base. Darth Vader becomes obsessed with finding Luke & pursues his friends in order to capture him. In the end, the decision rests with Luke who can either choose to complete his training or confront the Sith Lord & save his friends.Directed by Irvin Kershner, who adapts the storyline that was conceived by George Lucas, The Empire Strikes Back brims with a darker, sinister mood that encapsulates the whole picture from the start. Kershner's direction is laudable for he does a brilliant job in putting up a narrative that's just as effective as its predecessor, and then some more. The screenplay steps away from a number of conventions, defies expectations at every corner, and commences the trend of film sequels heading into a darker territory which, even after 35 years, happens to be quite prevalent in the motion picture industry.Production design team makes sufficient use of its bigger budget to put on screen some more elaborate set pieces. Cinematography makes greater use of its colour palette & precision lighting to capture every event in splendid detail. The visual effects are slightly more refined even if the entire visual encapsulation has deteriorated over the years and looks outdated. Editing is more improved and its 124 minutes of runtime is steadily paced. And last but not the least, John Williams delivers yet another epic, enthralling & pulsating score that feels more evolved than last time and seamlessly integrates into the narrative.Coming to the performances, The Empire Strikes Back presents Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, David Prowse, Anthony Daniels, Peter Mayhew, Kenny Baker & others reprising their roles from the previous feature, while new additions include Billy Dee Williams & Frank Oz. The arc of every character continues to develop plus various relationships & conflicts are introduced or established with the actors doing an adequate job with what they're given. Darth Vader once again turns out to be the main highlight and is even more intimidating than before while the rest of the cast exhibit more comfort in their respective roles.On an overall scale, Star Wars: Episode V \u2013 The Empire Strikes Back is a successful follow-up chapter that raised the bar for both sequels & its genre at its time of release and remains an important entity of modern pop culture. The absence of any nostalgic attachment to this franchise as well as its dated visuals once again result in an average film experience for me but I did have more fun with this instalment than the one that preceded it.

The movie is set between episodes 4 and 6 doing a perfect job of not only carrying through the success of the first movie and surpassing it in my opinion but also does an amazing job of setting up episode 6 to conclude the trilogy without leaving an annoying cliffhanger at the last minute.

As a brief summary, The Empire Strikes Back is a classic example of a movie that the critics of the time got very wrong. Initially receiving mixed reviews and being slammed by some is nowadays considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time and the best Star Wars film overall...and its not hard to see why! The Empire Strikes Back continues on from the events of Star Wars revisiting the characters of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo. The Empire Strikes Back is known to be the much darker sequel, with much more character depth, vulnerability and emotion. Lucas continues to develop his beloved characters in all the right ways with the Han-Leia relationship, the more powerful feeling of friendship and of course the biggest, most shocking twist in cinematic history with Vader and Luke in the final act of the film. The Empire Strikes Back also continues to evolve the world introducing us to new places, new characters such as the legendary Jedi master, Yoda, improving the special effects and an even more beautiful soundtrack, provided by John Williams. The Empire Strikes Back is a perfect example of a sequel done right, equal and at times even better than the original. Epic battles, intense space chases, powerful emotional character development, shocking twists, thought-provoking ideas, themes and messages and finally groundbreaking sequences and special effects. In terms of flaws The Empire Strikes Back virtually has none whatsoever, other than an unfortunate twist which has had a negative response later on in the franchise, a few unnecessarily long scenes of Luke's training, and in my opinion a slightly weaker general plot than the original story.

A New Hope felt like a somewhat poor beginning to the series (a little forced and rushed at times. Still a good movie though), but this one starts it up again and immediately makes it better. It picks up right off the bat, then slows back down again. It's quite well paced.

This one follows up Star Wars which was so great at the time that it would be hard to follow it up. But by god they've done it, not only a good sequel but better than the original. Yes there are a few nitpick moments but they're overshadowed easily by all the great things in this movie.To begin with the characters, we now have a more mature Luke that has learned a bit more about being a leader for the rebels and even his connection with the force has grown to a point where we see him become this great Jedi. However there still is a lot to learn and that's why we are introduced to Yoda. Yoda is a puppet but it never feels like that, he feels like an actual character that is just too great. Every line he says is just so quotable and useful that the audience really gets a feel of the force. This is a perfect way to continue what we learned in Star Wars but make it even bigger and more understandable so that we really get what Luke should feel. We also get introduced to Lando, which is an old friend of Han and it was very interesting to see why he did what he did. At first you think he's good because he seems like Han's friend but then he betrays him, however in the end he chose to help them out and ends good. To see this much conflict in a person in so little time was done great in my opinion and I loved how they used him in the next movie following this one. In the last movie we saw a little glimpse of a love between Han and Leia but now they bond even more and in the end we really care for Leia losing Han in the carbonite. During the movie we get a lot of funny banter between them leading up to this love and it just feels real. 3PO and R2 have split up so now 3PO is with Han, Leia and Chewie and he is still the funny droid from the first one. There are a lot of funny moments where he interacts with Han and the others so it definitely has a lot of humor as well, more than the first. Vader has now had a defeat in the first so he is out for revenge and every scene he is in you feel his menacing presence, you're scared of what he will do but also understands why he does things.The story also works great, after the last one the empire has regrouped their fleet and have hunted down the rebels up to the point where they're hiding on a snow planet called Hoth. This is exactly what you would want from a movie called Empire Strikes Back, they are hunting down the rebels because of what we've seen in the last movie. When this movie ends you really know that the Empire has won ground on the rebels and the rebels are crippled so now the rebels have to regroup between now and the next. It's the perfect way of showing the Empire actually striking back and it makes for a darker but still very interesting movie following up the first.The effects and visuals are once again incredible for it's time, it doesn't look like an old movie, there are a few dated things but its still a beautiful looking movie with excellent usage of practical effects and sets instead of computer generated things that look fake. The battle of Hoth and the TIE fighter pursuing the Falcon through the asteroids are intense scenes that look incredible. Also the lightsaber battle improved compared to the last one, not only are the lightsabers better visualized but they choreographed it a bit more to make it a bit more intense but still keeping it grounded and personal.I also want to say that it's a movie with a lot of humor, funnier than the last one, and a lot of good progression in the relationships of the characters. The love between Leia and Han feels real and at the end you instantly want to see how they deal with getting Han back. Yoda makes for a great teacher for Luke and learns Luke what it is to not only be a Jedi but also a good person. And to be more specific about this, he makes for my favorite scene ever in a movie, not just Star Wars. This is of course the scene where the X-wing is sinking and he tells Luke that it is not impossible to get the X-wing out of the swamp. By using the force this can be done, Luke tries and fails and when he does Yoda explains him the true spirit of the force. With this he not only makes the force understandable for Luke but also the audience and when Luke then says that it's impossible, this little creature uses just his fingers and his incredible connection with the force to get the X-wing out. This shows the ultimate power of the force and it's possibilities.Then lastly about the ending, I think it's brilliant, having Vader as Luke's father makes it so personal and gives us a human side to Vader which was needed to make him more of a character instead of this menacing villain. And then to end with the questions about how it will end with Luke and his father, about how they will get Han back and of course if the rebels will find the strength to defeat the empire. It gives us everything we wanted out of a sequel and left us wanting more. It's the perfect end to a perfect sequel in a great trilogy.

Right off the bat, the film starts with one of the best action set pieces in cinema which is the Hoth battle, and once again, the practicality of the whole scene was beautiful and remarkable, the miniatures still aren't as noticeable and still pretty much hold up until today. The imperial walkers were mesmerizing to see in the screen and still holds up compared to CG nowadays. Darth Vader returns and makes one hell of a comeback from a limited amount of screen time last movie. However, the Hoth battle was just an appetizer, there were plenty more to come. As Luke and R2D2 goes to the Dagobah system, he meets Yoda, one of the most beloved Star Wars characters. Han, Leia, Chewie and C3-PO try to escape as the Empire mercilessly hunts them down. As these 2 narratives coincide with each other, the movie gives you more depth and development for each of the characters. Luke learned the way of the Force, Han and Leia developed a relationship that sparked an amazing sense of chemistry between the two. At the end of the film, the two narratives collide and a showdown between Vader and Luke occurs that is both tense and exciting to see. From a suspenseful and chilling duel, it became an emotional ride for both the audience and for our hero. Giving us one of the best twists in cinema history, this film cements its place in our memories and in cinema forever. The dialogue in the film was also brilliant, surprisingly, most of the best and quotable lines came from Yoda and they were executed very well. The choreography for the lightsaber battles were handled way better than before, (especially since they now know that the lightsaber was a great idea after all) and they used it to their advantage.

Now, from what I understand, the original negatives/prints were destroyed or altered during the restoration for the Special Edition release back in 1997 and, as a result, can't be restored. Therefore, the laser-disc transfers from 1993 are being used as source material for the DVD release, which explains why these \"bonus\" DVD's (don't get me started on the originals only being - according to the soulless marketing geniuses at LucasFilm - \"bonus\" discs), won't be anamorphic and without 5.1 surround sound. I also understand that LucasFilm is not willing to put in as much time, effort, or money into this project since the original unaltered films didn't represent his true \"vision\" for the films. However, I take issue with the reasoning behind this thought process.First of all, I'll admit I'm no film restoration expert, but common sense would tell me that 95% of the restoration of the original unaltered trilogy has already been done since only, at the very most, 5% of the original movies was altered for the Special Edition release", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "excellent", "date": "2015-12-07T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3368119", "sentiment score": [0.1186, 0.2488, 0.2139, 0.2986, 0.1201]}, {"content": "Empire strikes back is the second star wars film of the original trilogy and arguably the greatest film of all time.

It does it by taking the existing universe, expanding it in a logical manner, staying with what worked in the previous film yet adding something new and original as well. You can definitely see that they hadn't planned for this film in advance because there's a lot of new stuff. Suddenly we have the character of Yoda, the reveal of Luke's father, the romantic tension between Han and Leia (you can see pretty well in the first film that she was supposed to end up with Luke) and the continuation of the war between the Alliance and the Empire.But, unlike in so many other sequels, in this case it works because the film makers hadn't painted themselves into a corner with the first film. There was still story left from the original to explore. The Emperor hadn't been dealt with, it was possible that Darth Vader might have survived the destruction of the first Death Star and Luke still had much to learn about the Force. And thus we get a film that might be one of the best sequels ever made, if not one of the best movies in general.The film is also a significant leap forward in terms of technical quality. They had a much bigger budget with this film, plus more experience with the new effects the first film had pioneered, and it shows. From Darth Vader's improved armor and look to the explosions and the spaceships to the lightsaber battles. They all look fantastic and have held up remarkably well over the decades.Furthermore, the story is just as good as in the first one. The Battle of Hoth that opens the film might very well be one of my favourite battle scenes in all of cinema and the lightsaber duel near the end of the film is easily the best one in all of the franchise. Plus, we get a lot of new stuff, as stated, and they all work very well. Yoda's puppetry effects have not aged as well as some other effects in the film, but they're still pretty impressive even by today's standards and the character itself is a lot of fun. Kind of Jar Jar done right. You know, a crackpot local (I know he's not really from Dagobah, shut up) alien who talks funny, messes around, but is still needed for the plot. Except in Yoda's case there's some actual wisdom beneath the initial goofiness.Overall I think I prefer Episode IV to this one, but it's by a very slight margin. This one has better battles, better effects and equally great story, but Episode IV had better atmosphere and sense of mythos.

That is how I feel about the Empire Strikes back: And I haven't a clue how I am going to express myself in less than 1000 words, but by god I will try.These days, it's tough to find a movie sequel that is worth watching. It's the kind of thing that causes critics and casual fans alike to roll their eyes and say: \"Really? Another one??\" And it's true, sequels are usually the victims of poor script, less than decent acting and ugly visual effects.But don't lose hope my friends, if you are sick and tired of the sequels of the 21st century, I present to you Star Wars: The Empire strikes back (1980), directed by Irvin Kershner and written by Lawrence Kasdan. The sequel to the astronomically (haw) successful film \"Star Wars\" (1977).Arguably the best Star Wars film ever made, and definitely one of THE best films ever made of the 20th century, TESB surprised and astounded audiences of all ages. Who knew it could get any better than blown up Death Stars and Garbage compactors? To begin, the film is relentlessly suspenseful right off the bat. Not even ten minutes in, and our main heroes are already in a spot of trouble. Something the last film accomplished but not to the same degree. And then, just when we think everyone is back together and all is well, a great snow battle ensues between the Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Empire. I would say that this is the jist of the plot of the film, but that's taking it way too lightly.What Kershner does so well is he takes the characters that you have grown to love and pits them up against their darkest, most sinister fears. Everyone is broken up, vulnerable, misguided and tortured (mentally and physically). And yet...the film can be quite humorous at times. While it does delve into deep, dark places, it never goes so far that you start to feel depressed with our heroes situation. It is still an extremely fun ride no matter which scene you're watching.One of the most enjoyable aspects of TESB is Frank Oz's incredible puppet Yoda, or rather, his incredible portrayal of Yoda, because at the end of the day, the little green creature is another character in the story. Now when I saw this film when I was younger, I of course believed that Yoda was a real thing. I didn't really know how movies were made back then. Now of course, seeing it through adult eyes, now I know how the film makers operated Yoda and brought him to life, but the whimsy is still there, he still feels completely real in every shot he is in. And I always feel like a kid again whenever he starts talking.The performances in ESB are so much better, no doubt because of the stronger script and stronger direction. Also that these actors have had three whole years to get to know their characters a bit better. Mark Hamill in particular, who may have rushed a few of his lines, or sounded maybe just a pitch too whiny in the previous film, has become such a grown character, not fully grown, but you can see a maturity there that simply didn't exist before. To Hamill's credit, he is also a big reason why we can believe the existence of the non-human characters such as R2-D2 and Master Yoda. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher have perfect chemistry and none of their romantic scenes ever felt out of place.And lastly, although I have decided not to spoil anything, I will say that the ending to TESB is so incredibly unique and different to anything we have seen before, and we will never see anything like it again. The group is divided, characters have been injured, they aren't in the best of shape, but what do they do? They move on...they keep their optimism and hope. Their situation is not perfect, but they are able to find a small shimmer of light in the growing shadows. And that's what makes this film so incredibly moving, what a perfect lesson for movie goers of all age demographics. That no matter how hopeless a situation is, somewhere there is an answer.Therefore I give The Empire Strikes back a 10 out of 10. I struggled to find any faults with this movie, and was pleased that I could think of none. So I hope you go out and enjoy it as much as I have, and will continue to do so.

It is deeper, more mature, and asks more questions of the world. R2D2 and Chewbacca, who became lovable fan favourites from the moment they hit the screen in 1977, did so without speaking a single word, but here they are much more than just accessories to the plot. In their grunts and roars and beeps, they now became beacons of loyalty for our group. The iconic opening crawl speaks of the events in between the two films - a time skip has occurred and the rebels are in hiding. The strengths of the characterisations show us exactly what has happened in these months unseen; Luke has become a respected fighter and commander, Han a captain, and his bickering and romantic tension with Leia only growing stronger (and which results in one of the most iconic confessions of love of all time). We see the bonds of friendship so much stronger in this sequel, and as Chewie attempts to repair CP3O and carries him around like a backpack, we recognise this is as an emotion of universality. No wonder Lucas used it again with Luke and Yoda. Fox had placed little faith in the original, and the budget had been constricted, and Lucas's vision mellowed. But after the immense popularity and success, ESB was given full backing. The world of Star Wars was now even more fully realised. We had visited the deserts of Tattoine, the Aztec pyramids rebel bases amidst jungle territory, and now the icy planets of Hoth, where an imperial assault is imminent. The battlefield was now much clearer and the greenscreen backdrops of the dogfight-style fighter pilots more detailed, more immersive - fellow rebel ground fighters, jets and Imperial assault crews now milled around in the background, and live explosions proved to be more threatening than the multicoloured digital explosions in the black of space. There was real weight and fluidity in the way that the X-Wings would speed in and out and under and over the AT-ATs, and the coverage now provided a greater and more epic scale of the action; see Luke run around the legs and dangle from the elephant- like robotic beast, and how the Millennium Falcon weaves around an entirely three dimensional asteroid field and narrowly escapes from a gigantic space slug. We have more new developments. Besides the stop-motion photography of the AT-ATs, which creates an oddly appropriate jerky walking motion, we also have the puppetry of the endearing Tauntauns which amble about in the snow, and their models are amazingly detailed, head to claw in a thick frost-covered hair, a dragon-shaped head and curved horns. And there is the old Jedi Master Yoda, whom I am conflicted on; at times it remains painfully obvious that he is a puppet, whose mouth does not correspond to the truths that he speaks, but they are great and important truths that become even more evident once Luke encounters the foreshadowing of himself in a Vader helmet. And of course the matte paintings are once again immaculate and beautifully detailed; in particular the landing platform on the edge of the Cloud City, and the glorious Bespin itself, bathed in the pink glow of the sunset and clouds. As the Falcon soars away above the sunset, Williams' Cloud City orchestral theme is at its most stirring, and is the second most iconic in the soundtrack, right after (what else?) The Imperial March. Never has a trumpet fanfare been so menacing and so recognisable - also named Darth Vader's Theme because the mere sighting of it signalled his presence and power. Vader is photographed more ingeniously than in Star Wars (in brightly lit exteriors) and this enhances his terrifying persona; giving instructions from his own personal capsule, force-choking over the communications channel, emerging from icy mist in the freezing tunnels of Hoth, slivers of light hitting his mask and creating a dark and shiny gleam, and in that climatic duel between father and son, both are silhouetted on the orange steps by the smoking vents, and the colours of the shimmering lightsabers tell us all that we need to know about their allegiances. This is one of the classic movie villains at his peak, but it is more than black and white (or blue and red) morality - there is just a hint of fatherly affection behind that mask, buried deep below, but we see the inklings of a plan, tinges of regret that have formed over the years living in the Dark Side. And in Luke's horrified reaction, the realisation that his own vices may well lead him down the same path. The studio was not entirely happy about leaving Vader in his tumbling TIE fighter after the explosion of the first Death Star; sequels were regarded as pulpy cash-ins rather than significant narratives. But Empire proves its worth, and then some - it ends with Vader's cruel blow and confession, the loss of a hand, and the capture of a beloved character...but there is still a glimmer of hope.

This movie had to live up to the movie that changed how movies were made and filmed and exceeded it in every way.The Empire strikes back is the second movie in the Original Star Wars trilogy directed by George Lucas. Straight away this movie had a darker feel than the first one as we are introduced to a new planet known as Hoth. The opening sequence is brilliant with Luke being captured by the the ice creature, and is shortly followed by the riveting battle of Hoth.The Plot of the Movie is that of the title. The empire wants to get revenge on the rebels for destroying the death star in the previous movie. Although there is a deeper meaning to the plot. Darth Vader is after Luke Skywalker as he realises that he is the last threat to the empire. Instead of trying to kill him he want's him by his side for him to rule along side him.In this movie we are introduced to Yoda who is an old Jedi Master who Luke has summoned in the hope that he would train him to become a Jedi Knight. He showed that Jedi come in all shapes and sizes and proved that to Luke when he lifted an all but seamless sunken X wing from the deep waters of Dagobah. Yoda was maybe the best new character in this movie as he came across as funny but at the same time very wise and was one with the force. Han and Princess Leia travel to the cloud city where they are greeted by one of Han's former allies Lando. Although shortly after they arrive They find out that they has struck a deal with Darth Vader who holds them hostage, using them as bait knowing Luke would come to them.For them what followed shower what a great story teller George Lucas was at the time and how much he cared about the characters and how they had develop from the last movie.Han Solo is frozen in carbonite and sold to a bounty hunter Bobba Fett, who would take him to Jabba the Hutt. While this scene is taking place Harrison Ford says one of the best improvised lines in movie history. Princess Leia tells him that she loves him and he replies\" I know\". Apparently Harrison Ford thought that line would be better than what was originally planned. When Luke finally get's to Vader an epic light saber duel takes place. Vader is toying with Luke and trying to get him to use his anger and slowly turn to the dark side of the force as he knows it's the only way he can defeat him. Eventually Vader overpowers Luke and chops off his arm leaving Luke defenseless. Once again the movie proves why it's one of the greatest of all time when Vader tells Luke that he is his father, taking everybody by shock. Luke cannot believe it and tries to commit suicide by letting himself fall down a huge drop as he believes he has nothing to live for. Leia and Chewbacca pick up Luke and fly off into light speed escaping the empire. The film ends with a glimmer of hope as Luke and Leila are looking into a bright star which identifies there is still hope for them yet.Overall this film is a masterpiece. It provides everything a great sequel needs. A great plot, great characters, a menacing villain and humour when needed. All of this was done correctly by George Lucas who didn't just create one the most iconic film trilogies of all time he created a whole universe of different stories and characters thanks to these three great movies.

The film immortalized the already iconic characters that George Lucas created in Star Wars, while making a very dense and entertaining film. The Empire Strikes Back is so great because of the improvements made to Darth Vader, the ambitious tonal change, and the fact that it still contains one of the best twists ever. With enough analysis the most impressive thing about The Empire Strikes Back is how hard it is to find flaws in the film.Darth Vader still stands, and probably always will stand as one of the best villains ever brought to the screen, second on my list only to The Dark Knight's Joker. However, in Vader's first appearance Vader is slightly inconsistent in that he's a temperamental villain often yelling, which isn't nearly as scary as a villain who remains calm. I would contest that the best villains act like they are always in control, whether they are not, it is in The Empire Strikes Back that Vader develops into this villain, while also systematically murdering his failing accomplices. It could be argued that Vader's development helped the tonal change that Empire Strikes Back brought.It's another testament to the villain, when they are so chilling that the tone of the film seemingly dives with them. As Vader develops into the more controlled, systematic villain the tone of the film dives into a darker world. With Star Wars being considered, at least partially, a kids film it seems extremely ambitious of Lucas and Kershner to make a film directed at kids dark, something many filmmakers are unwilling to do today. The dark tone helps accentuate the character development as the characters hit their all time lows, and the film's tone represents that the world isn't always nice.The story for Empire Strikes Back, being the middle film in the trilogy, had the most freedom, and used it accordingly. The story of Empire Strikes back is arguably, the strongest in the series, as the film was one of the earliest to say the bad guy can win, in a giant blockbuster, another very ambitious move. However, the best element of the story is the unpredictable turns it makes, in particular it's iconic twist. The twist remains one of the most famous of all time, for a reason, and the film benefits from it.In the end Empire Strikes Back has the best story in the trilogy, the best character development, is very ambitious, and immortalizes it's iconic villain. On top of all of that it has been copied numerous times over the years, and remains one of the best films ever made.

But before I begin, let me get one thing out of the way. This is NOT the best Star Wars film of all time. That honour lies with the original, which it always will. There's a multitude of great scenes here, but I can and will argue that every one of them is derived from the original.In case the original Star Wars lulled you into a false sense of security - the Death Star is destroyed, Tarkin is dead and Vader is lost in space - Empire Strikes Back (the name says it all) opens with the iconic Battle of Hoth, where the rebels are once again on the run from an Empire with superior numbers and firepower. Everything about this battle sets the mood of Empire - most of which is spent on the run. If your heart isn't beating faster than usual when Vader is walking up to the Millennium Falcon, then you're straight up lying.There's no point wasting space talking about the performances in Empire Strikes Back, because Hamill, Fisher, Ford, Daniel and the actors behind Vader are just as good in this film as they were in the original. Ford and Fisher's on screen chemistry is what every movie couple aspires to be - it is not only believable but obvious that the Princess falls for the scoundrel Solo. Frank Oz joins the cast as the delightful Yoda, and his performance is perfect both in Yoda's wisest and most comedic moments. See also Billy Dee Williams, who became one of the franchise's most beloved characters in such a small amount of time. Williams' easy smile and commanding delivery shows us very clearly why he was in the conversation for the role of Han Solo.The reason that Empire Strikes Back is the perfect sequel is that it delves deeper into the parts we wanted to know more about. Yoda warns us that Luke is not right to be a Jedi, and then we watch Luke make the very mistakes Yoda was warning him about. Vader is built into an incredible villain in this movie - he knows Luke is his son and he still maims him. One of the things I loved in this movie was the similarity of Vader's approach to Admiral Ozell and Captain Needa's failures. Ozell is a buffoon and Needa an honest and upfront man willing to accept responsibility, and they both meet the same fate. Its a small thing, but it says so much about Vader's lack of empathy.Kershner is a very skilled director, probably the best in the franchise. Some of my favourite directed scenes include the devastating duel between Luke and Vader, where it is immediately obvious that Luke is out of his depth, and the incredible scene in which Vader's human head is revealed to the audience. A facial expression or change in body language is enough to speak volumes to the audience.I'm not in love with Empire Strikes Back. I find Hoth's Yeti, the giant asteroid worm, and the community's bizarre obsession with Boba Fett to be rather annoying. I also found Hoth, Dagobah and Bespin to be relatively flat and uninspired worlds by Star Wars standards.

The development of Darth Vader and the Empire is vicious and well placed. The end a real cliff hanger and a surprise the first time through.So why not 10 stars? My main complaint of the film is the middle act isn't exciting. Just think for a second about all the fun action in the middle of a new hope compared to Empire. In A New Hope they get on the Falcon, Luke trains in the force, a planet is destroyed, they encounter the death star, they hide from the troops, they save the princess, Obi-Wan fights Vader and dies, they fight off a ton of troops to get back to the falcon and they fight some tie fighters in the air to escape the Death Star. In Empire Strikes back Han, Lea and company try to escape the empire before eventually getting caught. Darth Vader and the empire decide to try to convert Luke, and Luke learns from Yoda before eventually leaving against Yoda's will to save his friends.Sorry Empire, but in comparison, that isn't a lot of excitement especially if you have already seen the film before. How could the middle act have been better you might ask? I say increase the pace of everything, especially Yoda and Luke's first meeting. Maybe Han could have had Chewy and/or Lea firing at the tie fighters and bombers from the gunner position while on the run. There also could have been a space fight with cloud city with Lando saving the Falcon crew at the last moment.All I'm saying is that there's a real excitement void in the middle act of the movie which everyone seems to gloss over.

The film begins in the rebel base on the ice planet Hoth. The whole Hoth sequence is my favorite of the whole series. We see our hero Luke Skywalker get attacked by a yeti like monster and have to use the force to escape. The battle with the Empire's At-Ats and the rebels is the coolest scene in the movie. The AT-ATs are giant walking machines that are almost impenetrable so Luke and the other rebel pilots have to come up with a way to stop them because their guns won't stop them. Luke devises a plan where they circle the legs with a towing line to trip them. It is a really really cool scene. The Empire does shut down the bases power though our heroes must flee.Instead of joining Han, Chewy, and Leia, Luke goes to the Dagobah system because of a vision he received from the ghost of his former master Obi-Wan Kenobi. On Dagobah Luke meets Yoda. Yoda is one of the most iconic Star Wars characters. He is the most powerful Jedi warrior even though he is only about a foot tall and green. Yoda trains Luke to become the ultimate Jedi Warrior.Meanwhile Han and the Millennium Falcon are being chased by the Empire through asteroid fields. They decide to go to Cloud City to enlist the help of Han's old friend Lando, Billy Dee Williams. It ends up being a trap and Darth Vader captures Han, Chewy, and Leia.

Luke Skywalker is instructed to seek Jedi training from Yoda. An attack by Imperial forces leaves the Rebel base in ruins but Han Solo, Princess Leia and company narrowly escape in the Millennium Falcon. They venture to Cloud City where Lando Calrissian betrays them thus setting a trap for Skywalker. Cliffhanger ending hinders it in standing on its own but director Irwin Kershner explores darker aspects. Mark Hamill returns as Luke who learns endurance, concentration, priorities, friendship, and very hard truths that leave him literally dangling for survival. Harrison Ford as Han learns to put the needs of others ahead of his own particularly when sacrifices arise. Carrie Fisher return as Leia who strengthens her leadership. Billy Dee Williams as Lando realizes his mistakes and hopes correction is possible. David Prowse dons the suit and presents the intimidating presence of Darth Vader who presents those ever famous hard hitting words to Luke.

It's appropriate that the second part of the three-act story is the dark entry so the more light-hearted third act can act as a release from the darkness and despair.Imagine if Star Wars went in the direction of The Planet of the Apes franchise? It's a miracle the studio had no input into the film, creating the movie sequel all movie sequels aspire to be. What if it was a rushed out sequel titled Star Wars II? If Jaws started the trend of blockbusters and Star Wars cemented it, then The Empire Strikes Back was the final step in the birth of the blockbusters, by cementing the rules behind the art of the movie sequel (and creating the subtitle any movie sequel wishes they had). However, could the film's quality also due to Lucas not having any input into the writing or directing of the film?The Empire Strikes Back is a film of more advanced directorial prowess than A New Hope in this ridiculously fast-paced movie. Right from the start, you can tell the characters within The Empire Strikes Back are much deeper than the first film. Han and Leia are simply one of the greatest romances in all of cinema; the classic tale of two who pretend to hate each other but are secretly in love, a trope as old as cinema. Watch as the two engage in the hottest moments of a generally a-sexual franchise. It's no surprise the two are posed in the manner of Rhett Butler and Scarlet O'Hara on the film's poster. Yet The Empire Strikes Back introduces the closest thing to rivaling the coolness of Han Solo in the form of Lando Calrissian played by Billy Dee Williams, to inject some smooth blaxploitation vibes into the Star Wars universe (not to mention the beauty of the Cloud City theme).The planets in Star Wars are like characters themselves from the tundra of Hoth providing a counter to the deserts of Tatooine, to the intimacy and poignancy to the scenes on the swamp planet Dagobah and its one (as far as we know) lowly inhabitant. Yoda really is a perfect creation, like Obi-Wan, you do wonder if everything he says is full of nonsense when you break it down but it doesn't matter. It's just a shame the perception of the character has become bastardized because of the prequels. Plus what is it about stop-motion that is just endlessly appealing to look at from the long shots of the Tauntauns to those majestic herds of impending was elephants known of AT-ATs during the Battle of Hoth. The manner in which the stop motion doesn't have the full fluid motion of live action movement but not to the point that it looks choppy is a visual I never tire off.Although the darkest, The Empire Strikes Back is the funniest film of the series. C-3PO constantly telling people about the improbability of escaping the situation they're getting themselves into, to Han's many sarcastic whips never fails to get a laugh. Plus the movie keeps teasing you that you're going to get to see that iconic jump to light speed shot from the first film, making it all the more satisfying when you finally do get to see it.Even Darth Vader is significantly deepened as a character in The Empire Strikes back, thanks in part to him getting his own theme music to strike the fear of impending authoritarianism into your heart, but also thanks to certain plot twist.\"I am your Father\", the most well-known piece of pop culture knowledge. Is there anyone in the civilised world who doesn't know Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's father?

Overall, I think this film is a masterpiece and one of the best films of all time and this is why, but first, let me explain the film's story.The film is set three years after the fourth film (which was the first film released in the saga), this was the second film released in the saga, but the film is chronologically the fifth installment in the overall STAR WARS film franchise.The Galactic Empire, under the leadership of the villainous Darth Vader, is in pursuit of Luke Skywalker and the rest of the Rebel Alliance. While Vader chases a small band of Luke's friends - Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, R2-D2, C3PO and Chewbacca - across the galaxy, Luke studies the Force under Jedi Master Yoda. When Vader captures Luke's friends, Luke must decide whether to complete his training and become a full Jedi Knight or to confront Vader and save his comrades.This has grown in esteem to be the most critically acclaimed chapter in the STAR WARS franchise and it is now considered one of the greatest films ever made and in 2010, the film was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being \"culturally, historically and aesthetically significant.\" The story is an epic one and plots just almost everything you wanted to see when spaceships are flying round perfectly. There are scenes of comedy, but this a lot more darker and serious. The one thing that shocked me was when Darth Vader tells Luke, \"I am your father\".The main cast returns to good form and probably even better before, Mark Hamill does good and improves and although he isn't as good as he was in the first STAR WARS film he was in, but he really does very good. Harrison Ford does great and he is amazing as Han Solo. Carrie Fisher as just great and she gets better in this film and when she and Harrison Ford are on screen together, I just think of Anakin and Padme, Bella and Edward and Rhett and Scarlett from Gone With the Wind.George Lucas does not direct or write this film. Irvin Kershner directs and his style is really good and the script is written by Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett create a script that has to be a very good script and really it's a great idea for a second STAR WARS film.The visuals and music improve overall and some space sequences are really great as heck and I got excited when I saw the lightsaber duel between Luke and Vader, I just got excited and it was a really amazing thing.Overall, I love THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK and I give it a 10 / 10 and I will conclude my STAR WARS original trilogy review with STAR WARS EPISODE VI: RETURN OF THE JEDI.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "One of the best excellent films of all time!", "date": "2015-04-27T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3227825", "sentiment score": [0.0048, 0.028, 0.1353, 0.6037, 0.2282]}, {"content": "Although Star Wars Episode IV was groundbreaking, as a kid I always loved to see Star Wars Episode V, as basically it took all the things developed in the first movie, and built on them to create something 1,000 times better like a good sequel should, rather than just retracing the steps of the previous film. Although my family didn't own Episode V, my brother's friend did, and surprised me when I was about 6 years old by bringing over Episode V in secret, and I adored every last minute of it!So what's the deal? After the destruction of the Death Star in the previous film, the Empire gained its revenge, and the Rebel Alliance was scattered across the Galaxy in a bitter chase. Now on the ice planet of Hoth, Jedi Luke Skywalker is told in a vision to go to the planet of Dagobah to learn from a mystical Jedi Master known as Yoda. Meanwhile, the Empire determines their location, and after a vicious fight between the ill-equipped Rebels and the Empire's AT-AT Walkers, the group must flee the planet, with Han Solo and Chewbacca taking Princess Leia and C-3PO in a desperate bid to escape the Imperial blockade aboard the Millennium Falcon, whilst Luke and R2D2 journey to the swamp world of Dagobah to find the mysterious Jedi, all while being pursued by the vengeful Dark Lord, Darth Vader, obsessed with turning Luke to the Dark Side.As I said, rather than retreading the first movie like many sequels do, the Empire Strikes Back takes all the elements from the first movie, the fantastic models, the gripping action, the story, the characters, and expands on them. The development of the characters, such as romantic relationship that you can genuinely believe between Han and the Princess is established, Luke is trained in the art of a Jedi, being able to control and channel the Force, and Darth Vader's truly evil powers are built upon, now being a ruthless leader of a frightened Army.The story is also one that throws you on so many loops. I've watched this movie a million times so nothing surprises me, but if you're watching for the first time, there are many things about this film that will give you a shock, or take you by surprise. I of course wont name them, but you'll see what I mean.The action sequences have also been massively improved since the last movie. Whilst the battle above the Death Star, though long, was impressive, the battle against the AT-AT's in the snow with the stop-motion movement of the Walkers and the fight of the Snowspeeders is just so good it's practically real. Every individual piece is manipulated and choreographed to perfection to create a truly awesome fight scene. The lightsaber battles too have been made more energetic, and take place on a wider range of locations, as well as the mastery of the Force and powers that it entails being developed heavily.Overall, I consider this both my best Science-Fiction film, but also my best film of all time. A film that even today has me hooked, and continues to be the awe and inspiration of so many even 35 years after it first hit the big screen.

This depth of character is what adds to the first film and makes it so much better than the rest of the series. It shows the good and the evil, the greed and corruption and the tyranny that grows within the corners of the of the Star Wars universe.The cinematography, score and special effects remain quite consistent, moving on from those that were present in the first film. The only exception of this is the special effects, which have been slightly spruced up since the first film.The story itself has become a lot more brutal and unforgiving, without moving into spoilers, it fully embraces the dark side of the force and fully explores the darkest corners of its plot.It is because of the emotions stirred in Empire that the entire series takes on a mythic quality that resonates back to the first and ahead to the third.This is the heart of the franchise, this is the peak.

In this second installment of the Star Wars Trilogy, the battle between the Rebellion and Imperial forces are extremely heated after Luke SkyWalker (played by Mark Hamill) destroys Darth Vader's (Voice over by James Earl Jones) DeathStar in the first film. Since then, the Imperial forces have driven the Rebels to the far away icy planet of Hoth in hopes of hiding from Darth Vader and the attacks from the Imperial force. It doesn't take Vader long to track down SkyWalker by using the dark side of the force, an ability that only Jedi and Jedi-like can use by tapping into the life forces that surround us. Upon hearing from his mentor, Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luke SkyWalker travels to the desolate planet of Dagobah to train with Jedi Master Yoda to become a true Jedi Knight. He will need this training from the presumed best in order to defeat Darth Vader if ever given the chance. Many characters enlighten us, frighten us, and make us laugh throughout the film. Characters like Han Solo, played by Harrison Ford, contributes comic relief. Princess Leia, played by Carrie Fisher, offers us a hardened shell on the outside, but also shows a softer side with slight romantic quips between her and Han Solo. Other comedic characters include R2-D2, which only beeps and gives somewhat emotional squeals to add a human effect if any. There's also 3CP0, an android robot translator that is fluent in over six million languages through the galaxies across space, who gives more comedic relief as well as advice to Han Solo and Princess Leia. There's somewhat of a tug of war between the two robots over who is smarter and the banter that goes back and forth between them is hilarious. The overall theme in the film is the battle between good and evil and the use of the force between the light side and dark side. Conflict is constant throughout the film in many scenes between many characters. There is romantic conflict between Han and the Princess, comedic struggle between R2-D2 and C3P0, and a dark conflict within Luke SkyWalker both internally and externally with Darth Vader. Given the fact that the film was produced and released in 1980, the special effects were mind blowing to go along with the infamous soundtrack that immediately connects you to what is going on in the film, whether it is the good side of the force or the dark side preparing for battle. The special effects that are especially breathtaking takes place when Cloud City comes into view. Along with light sabers, gigantic AT-AT walkers, TIE fighters that would remind you of fighter jets, and the coolness of the spacecraft that fly through space. This all takes you away from your normal, everyday life to make you a part of the Star Wars story. In conclusion, Star Wars makes you laugh, it will put you on the edge of your seat, it will touch your heart with the conflict between Han and Leia, and most of all, it will make you cheer for the home team in Luke Skywalker. The intense battle between Luke and Darth Vader will leave you breathless in the end with, what will ultimately be, the most gut punching, thought provoking statement Vader will ever tell young Luke Skywalker.

Vader plans to give Luke the opportunity to join him, by any means necessary, even to torture his friends, Han Solo and Princess Lea to get Luke to face him, then to reveal a shocking secret of the Skywalker line.Not only are the special effects, production and music as equally impressive as the original, but the characters and story are pushed to the limits. In fact, the heroes have a crushing defeat. All is put on the line and the film gets a little dark in some places. It proves that the Empire is not one to mess around with. While most of the characters are memorable. The one that steals the show is the Jedi Master, Yoda. Cute, adorable, wise and funny, it shows that a 2 foot tall Muppet can bring a sense of realism to the screen. The twist ending, must have had everyone in the theaters gasping and choking on there popcorn. Nobody saw it coming, not even those working on the movie. Only Lucas, the director and producers knew the real truth behind Darth Vader and it has now become a staple of parody and clich\u00e9, making it arguably the greatest movie twist of all time. Overall, The Empire Strikes Back is a thrilling action masterpiece. Developed and emotional characters, funny humor, dark elements, a twisting story and continuing impressive special effects.

I disagree. Plot In A Paragraph: A long time a go in a galaxy far, far away a classic tale of good vs evil is being played out, After the rebels have been overpowered by the Empire on their new base, Luke Skywalker takes advanced Jedi training with Master Yoda, while his friends are pursued by Darth Vader.What can you say about this movie that has not already been said?? The story is filled with the standard elements, (love, betrayal, over coming your fears and good vs evil) but the movie is anything but standard and it has a twist ending you'd never get away with in this day and age (the age of spoilers on the internet) I'll get what I didn't like out if the way first. When I first saw this as a kid, I was so excited to see it, but I hated the downbeat ending with what happened to Luke and Han Solo, and even recall being bored. And even now over thirty years later, I still remember how disappointed I was, even if I appreciate it for it's part in the story. But It feels bloated and over long, it seriously drags during the 50 mins - 1 hr 25 mark, I checked my watch and could not believe it had only been on an hour, It felt much longer. Now that's out of the way.....We get to see the ice planet Hoth, The swamp land of Degobah and the beautiful cloud City of Bespin, whilst introducing us to Landon Calrisian, and more importantly The Emperor and Jedi Master Yoda. I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. Everyone is spot on. Mark Hamill is excellent as the eager hero Luke Skywalker, who is devastated to learn a family secret. Harrison Ford is perfectly cast as the cocky pilot Han Solo, he is good looking with charisma in spades, whilst Carrie Fisher looks cute and feisty in equal measure. David Prowse does what is need of him as Darth Vader, but it's James Earl Jones who makes the biggest Vader impression and revelation. Unfortunately with the exception of Ford, the success of these movies type cast them and despite starting in some interesting movies with a good story and good performances. Sadly these pictures never found audiences as movie goers refused to see him as anything other than their characters here. The score by John Williams is again another valuable asset to the movie. One of my favourite parts of the movie was the banter between Ford and Fisher, they had real chemistry and I'm surprised they never paired up again away from these movies.

What's good about Empire Strikes Back is that it is more involving than its predecessor, it is fresh, dark, sinister, emotional and unpredictable in an original and great way but what comes as a particularly interesting subplot in this film is the daring, slick, ironic, manipulative, show-off and comedic dialog shared between Han Solo and Princess Leia. We witness awesome moments whenever it is only the two of them talking together alone in what looks like a romance moment between the two of them. And also the good thing is that the romance and dialogs between them is not over-the-top as some people might expect from a part romance film. And Harrison Ford is impeccably well cast as Han Solo in this movie, both in his acting and his looks and he is ultimately an exceptionally interesting character. And Darth Vader he isn't bad either. He is perfect as a villain: he is obsessed to catch the rebels that won a victory over his Galactic Empire three years earlier and he also punishes his commanders that involuntarily fail him in his attempt to catch the rebels by strangling them by the use of the Force. And he is also beautifully voiced by James Earl Jones though to be honest his small accent bothered me a bit and it harmed his beautiful and haunting voice as Darth Vader a bit. Actually, I think I will not consider it as a flaw as a matter of fact because of his beautiful and haunting voice and I think that his beautiful and haunting voice is enough to undo the flaw.

With so much so good about this there isn't much stuff wrong with it and criticism does not come easy. It is well acted, comedic but also ultimately reaches extreme new emotions for a film series and a sequel that really touches whatever you already knew about film. Overall I felt it was a masterpiece, and here below is why. The story is an epic one and plots just about everything you want to see when spaceships are flying round perfectly. This one also works so well in the entire series as a whole and without this only really episode IV would be ground breaking, it just combines action, adventure and comedy into a bundle of greatness. On that note of comedy, although the plot is very dramatic, you get that one two between characters that is just superb to see and reinvents old clich\u00e9s. The main cast return to good form and probably even better than before, Mark Hamill improves and although he isn't as good as he probably should be, he controls the role well. Harrison Ford yet again puts in a sublime acting display and his skills seen here are reason enough why film is so important to some people. I did feel Carrie Fisher also gets a little better from previously seen and when ever her and Ford are on screen there timing is brilliantly done.George Lucas doesn't direct or write this one and it could be said it benefits because of that, Irwin Kershner does direct it well although the real star behind the camera is Lawrence Kasdan who along with Leigh Brackett create a script that has to be one of the best ever seen in film, just so well written all the way through. I even think the effects improve overall and some spectacular space scenes make this also as well deeply dramatic, also heart raising.Criticisms well I said about how hard it is so let's try and find some. The only thing I can think of is occasionally parts can seem rather silly, Vader sometimes has really random sets used with him and overly extravagant \"offices\". At times the effects are not good but it was 1980 so I can't criticise it for that at all.Fans of Star Wars well, this should be there favourite one and although some come close, it is still overall the best movie in the series. If you like Sci-Fi, this is even worth it as a one off watch and even if you have never seen a Star Wars film before, this will still entertain. The only people I think who would dislike this are people who really don't like Sci-Fi as that is the only thing I can think of if you don't at least find it kind of OK.Overall it is more or less a Just About Flawless film and one that is essential viewing for any fan of all things film. It appears on so many best films of all time lists and can even top them at times so don't go in thinking you might not like it, give it a go and Empire may just come out being your favourite film of all time.

Star Wars (1977) is more fun, but Empire marks the point where the story gained more emotional depth and the matin\u00e9e serial black-and-white morality of the original becomes less defined.Howard Hawks once said a great movie has a few great scenes and no bad ones. If that is the case, then Empire is without doubt a great film, as one cannot find a bad scene in the bunch. As for great scenes, just take your pick: the battle on Hoth, Luke's training in Dagobah, the X-wing rising from the swampy muck, Lando's reluctant betrayal, Han and Leia's poignant farewell in the carbon chamber.Undoubtedly, the most iconic moment in this film is the climactic confrontation between Luke and Darth Vader, when our hero discovers his much-idealized father is a fallen Jedi who has lost much of his conscience and humanity. Though Luke's reaction to this reveal is often mocked and even I cannot help but chuckle sometimes, I think it's entirely appropriate. Hamill's big \"noooo\" is not forced or phony; the way his face contorts and his voice cracks makes it feel raw and heartbreaking.This is one of few films that gets better every time you watch it.

At the end of the second film we assumed Darth Vader would beat Luke in a lightsaber duel and then at the end of the final film Luke would finally kill Darth Vader. But then in what is still one of the biggest one-two punches ever aimed at an audience Darth Vader cuts off Luke's right hand and stuns the audience with the revelation \"I am your father.\" Suddenly the idea that Luke was going to kill Darth Vader went from absolute metaphysical certainty to something very much in doubt. The thought that it would be three years before we found out how this would play out drove us absolutely crazy (remember the wonderful speculation that Boba Fett was a clone of Obi- Wan?).I have to admit that I never really believed that George Lucas intended for Darth Vader to be Luke Skywalker's father from the very start. If he had then we would not have had that \"What I said was true...from a certain point of view\" from Obi-Wan Kenobi in \"The Return of the Jedi\" to explain the statement that Darth Vader killed Luke's father in the original \"Star Wars\" (change the name all you want, it is still \"Star Wars\" to me). But for a plot twist it certainly floored audiences. I went to the first showing the first day for all three \"Star Wars\" movies and since my brother made the mistake of flipping through the comic book version and stumbling across the film's big revelation (which he immediately shared with me) I was not surprised at what happened. But I still remember the audience gasping twice when Luke lost his hand and Darth Vader said his big line.\"The Empire Strikes Back\" is far and away the best of the \"Star Wars\" movies, whether you are talking the original three or all of the prequels as well. It is a very dark film in which things are constantly going wrong. Luke is attacked and almost killed by a snow monster, the base on Hoth is attacked and evacuated, the Millennium Falcon end up inside a giant worm, Luke abandons his training with Yoda too soon to help save his friends, Lando betrays Han who ends up a frozen statue, and then Luke loses his hand and learns the truth about daddy. The only real bright spot in the movie is when Leia and Han fall in love (the comic relief with C-3PO does not count) and even that ends on a major downer. There is nowhere to go but up at the end of this one and it is rather amazing how many people would go back repeatedly to see a movie whose idea of a happy ending is that nobody is dead yet.George Lucas again wrote the story but the script by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan brings the level of the dialogue up to a more adult level than the Saturday morning serial feel of the first film (ultimately, they might be the ones who most deserve the credit for making this the best \"Star Wars\" film). Director Irvin Kershner draws stronger performances out of the entire cast, which is precisely why he was picked for the second film. The result is an much more ambitious film where the characters have more depth, helped by the dramatic turns at the end that up the ante considerably on the story. Luke Skywalker is no longer the fresh-faced kid he was when we first met him, having to grow up really fast because of what happens in this film. But when you get audiences to take a Muppet as seriously as we take Yoda, then you are really accomplishing something. Even after all this time this film still works.This movie also reflected a great leap forward in terms of the special effects that were the hallmark of the first film. When we saw \"Star Wars\" one of the things we fell in love with what how far special effects had come since \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" the obvious reference point in the field of science fiction films. But that was nothing compared to what Industrial Light and Magic came up with three years later in \"The Empire Strikes Back.\" No wonder Lucas wanted to go back and fix some of the special effects shots in his first \"Star Wars\" film, especially with the X-wing fighters in the final attack on the Death Star. Compare that with the chase of the Millennium Falcon through the asteroid field in this one, which gets outclassed three years later by the Rebel attack on the new Death Star in the final film.When it comes to the second in a film trilogy \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is the standard by which such things are judged. Granted there are not many of them, but \"The Attack of the Clones,\" \"The Matrix: Reloaded,\" and even \"The Two Towers\" do not rise to the challenge. Ironically, \"The Empire Strikes Back\" was so good that it made it difficult for \"The Return of the Jedi\" to be better, especially since the final film was going to be more upbeat (and that was before all those cute Ewoks showed up).

Often described as 'bigger, better and darker', it's certainly an appropriate description of Empire. It succeeds by taking the most successful elements of A New Hope and minimising its weaknesses, while expanding the world.The main cast of Episode IV returns for Empire, with the major additions being Billy Dee Williams as Lando and Frank Oz providing the voice and charming puppeteer work for Yoda. Wisely, Lucas handed over the direction to Irvin Kershner, who takes up the helm admirably, and Lawrence Kasdan tightens up the screenplay. The latter especially improves the dialogue immensely. Regardless, its a slick production at its finest, with the effects, both CGI and practical, improving as well- the puppet-work being a standout for Yoda's simple yet delightful presence.Empire's narrative suffers typically from middle-film syndrome, serving primarily as continuation and set up. As such, it lacks a coherent beginning and the cathartic climax of the finale. But in doing so, it skips lengthy exposition and avoids the responsibility of tying up the loose ends. As such, it gets to indulge in its traits. Part of Empire's success is how it jumps from set piece to set piece with nary a quiet moment. From Hoth, through the asteroid field, to the finale in the clouds, it rarely lets up. And the few quiet moments either ratchet up the tension (the cloud city), or succeed in intriguing world building (Yoda on Dagobah). What is essentially a glorified training montage works through the interaction between Luke and Yoda and excellent atmospheric cinematography.What is often forgotten, simply from cultural osmosis, is that Empire contains a twist ending. Its such common knowledge that its sometimes forgotten that it even is a twist ending. Nevertheless, it's a sucker-punch that still has a kick even without the shock.Empire does so very little wrong. The characters are memorable, the set pieces are iconic. There's a strong argument for the Luke-Vader duel being the finest fight scene in the entire saga. While it lacks the extravagant stunt choreography of the prequels, the fight has a rawness to it that later flamboyant fights fail to match. And the emotional tension between the characters makes one really interested.It's often said to be the most morally ambiguous film, as part of its 'darker' theme. It is likely true, and certainly touches upon these issues. But to say this is only to bring attention to how idealistic Star Wars as a whole is- a betrayal is almost instantly redeemed, and the importance of friendship is at the fore. And it benefits from being able to set up conflicts without having to solve them.Certainly, it's only real flaw is its middle-child issues.

You are taken in by the vulnerable yet relatable characters, the overall journey of Luke Skywalker, and the amazing special effects which look better than some sfx in 2014.

Everything about this film is fantastic, with the great qualities that defined its predecessor being apparent in all corners of this film, with an added flare that is so normal of Kershner himself. The storytelling is so much more mature, and the soundtrack by the great John Williams covers this with Darth Vader getting his iconic theme that has defined villains in cinema history, and launched him into the centre of what could possibly be the best villain Hollywood has ever seen.The grand epic premise of Episode IV which led to the destruction of the first death star had us all rooting for the Rebels, but surely the Empire would 'strike back' and as such the Rebels are quashed in amazing fashion that leads the audience enthralled and gaping for more. Following a special movie, that had re-defined technology in cinema it would be a daunting task to accede this, but again the technological advancements remained on pace with the cinematography and editing being exquisite. Another comparison with A New Hope is that of the storytelling which is nothing short of amazing. Laurence Kasdan did a brilliant job here, giving us not only a better story but a more gritty story whilst retaining some of that humour that defined the relationship of Luke, Han and Leia. On that note, the characters are masterfully executed with Han clearly stealing the show as well as the climax of the film presenting us Leia's and Han's newly found love which had been developing slowly over the course of the film. Leia, the strong woman that she is, is as good as she was in Episode IV, and Luke who was merely an amateur develops into a well rounded Jedi though his brashness and selflessness leads him to ignore Yoda's plea leading to his epic confrontation with Vader. A well choreographed duel to say the least, but Luke's apparent frustrations and inexperience leads to his own demise at the hands of Vader. What follows next is probably the greatest twist in cinema history. It didn't feel out of place or forced, it just seemed so well done, but that single confrontation and revelation is \"Star Wars\". Luke- our hero - being the son of the embodiment of evil was such a shock, that the anticipation for the sequel was at an all time high. Overall, more questions were left than answered, though this can be a recipe for disaster, Star Wars: Episode V did it in such a satisfying way that true Star Wars fans cannot downgrade it. A further testament to the quality of the film is the fact that the editing doesn't take anything away from the overall quality of the film, which maintains its powerful nature till this very day.

I've seen it many times since, and in my later views I really wanted to like it, but I ended up disliking it even more. The first sign of silliness in my eyes was the snow-speeders equipped with harpoons and towing cables. Why should anyone install a harpoon to a flying machine? It turns out to topple AT-ATs. But how did they know they'd fight against walking moto-quadrupeds? Well, they didn't. It dawned on me that that was nothing more than lazy storytelling. Create the outcome first (tackle walking machines), invent how to generate it (using cables) later. And do it again, this time with Luke.Why did Luke flee the cave into the cold snow storm instead of killing the wampa? Because he had to come to the brink of death. And why is that? Because just before passing out he needs to see Obi-Wan's ghost. And what's it doing there? Obi-Wan's spirit is there to tell Luke where to find Yoda. Sorry but this is nonsense. First, the flow of the story is backwards, because at the time Luke leaves the cave, he has no reason to do so; he should have killed the wampa and stayed inside. Second, this part of the story must be about setting our main character in motion. Luke needs a motivation to pursue his Jedi training. One may argue that this must be the natural outcome of the first film. But still, Mr Lucas owes the viewer a decent sequence showing how Luke discovers where Yoda lives. The way Luke is informed of Dagobah in TESB is simply bad storytelling.That also leads to a hollow first act. The action in there has nothing to do with Luke's storyline. The Battle of Hoth is completely pointless. The first act must be all about sending Luke to Dagobah. Luke will go there anyway with or without this useless battle. But instead of watching Luke discover Yoda and Dagobah, we have to watch some silly battle.As a consequence, we have a first act disjointed from the rest of the film. The action is isolated from, and not related to, the further events. You can start watching the film 35 minutes into it, when Luke gives R2 the coordinates of the Dagobah system. There's nothing that makes sense before, explaining why Luke wants to finish his training, or how he knows where to go. For further study, compare this to how the story unfolds in A New Hope.Things don't go well in the second act either. The story forks, and I have the feeling that Mr Lucas didn't know what to do with Han Solo and Leia, and decided to hide them inside the stomach of a giant space eel. Luke in Dagobah scenes don't fare better. Luke is a pilot and is supposed to be top physical form. Why all the physical training? And it contradicts with what Yoda says: luminous beings are we, not this crude matter. Actually the problem is deeper. Jedi training is obviously not well thought of. It may look impressive on paper, with stream of consciousness and the like, but all we see on screen is a guy running with a backpack full of rocks, or trying to levitate things around him.The film is sort of alright 75 minutes into it, after Yoda moves Luke's X-wing out of the swamp. But not enough to make it more than 4 stars out of 10. Don't forget that some of the things the fans pan in Return of the Jedi and in the prequels are present in TESB some way, though not as pronounced as in the prequels. I have to come back to that but the first act of The Empire Strikes Back is a disaster. I've tried to make objective points anyone could check for themselves, you like this film or not.

The film is set three years after the events of Star Wars IV: A New Hope where Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) has studying the Force under exile Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz). Mid while, Darth Vader (voice by James Earl Jones), is in pursuit of him and the rest of the Rebel Alliance. When his friends are capture, Luke Skywalker must confront the man that kill his mentor, and save his comrades. This gritty movie was once criticize for its darker tone, and cliffhanger ending, but I love it, it really put all the characters to their limits both physically and emotionally, dealing with deceptive allies and make you want to watch the next movie. That's great filmmaking. Like its predecessor, The Empire Strikes Back draw from mythologist Joseph Campbell's book The Hero with a Thousand Faces, directly in it's tales that is taken right off from several mythological like Arthurian, classical Greco-Roman and others. There are similar motifs taken from other films and television shows like 1936's Flash Gordon, 1975's Dersu Uzala, and others worth noticing in the film. The movie even took influence from historic events like Nazism, the Wild West, and Samurai culture. It even dig into world religions. Some people might seeing the teaching of Yoda as boring scenes, but I love them. The movie really makes good on explaining more about what the Force is. The Force remind me of a new age amalgam of various eastern religious and western philosophical sources. A sense of Manichaeism, mixed with elements of Ralph Waldo Emerson's Romantic nature worship, Pantheism and Western-influenced Buddhism. Luke is not as annoying as the previous movie, as the film is mostly about his growth to maturation and self-discovery, but he does have some awful whining in this movie that makes you want to slap his face. Yoda in this movie works with the puppetry. The way Frank Oz performed and voiced him, made this character stand out. Not once, did I think it was a puppet. I would say, this was way better than the CGI Yoda or the puppet from Episode 1, big time! Industrial Light and Magic really pull it off, the action scenes in this film. This movie really make the Hoth Battle look real and intense. Another big prop to them is how great, Cloud City looks. As the technology has improved, Lucas has continued to tinker with the films, adding more creatures and more detail to the backgrounds and even reshooting certain scenes to get them closer to his ideal vision. In my opinion, this is one of the film that didn't get ruin by the 1997's Special Edition with pointless added scenes or badly done 1990's CGI. Glad, they didn't add the bad delete Wampa scenes. The Special Edition in my opinion, honestly, made it better. A good example of this is Cloud City. You really see more of the city than the original. It's beautiful. The 2004 version hurt the film a bit, changing Boba Fett's voice, but at less they add the real Emperor. The music by John Williams is great. I love the Imperial march introduced in The Empire Strikes Back as the theme music for Vader's pursuit of Han and Leia. The march's rhythm is driving and relentless, capturing Vader's own relentless progress through the story. For action, it's not as epic as 1977's Star Wars, but the story is way better than that movie. The love story in this film seem more realistic than the fairy tale love affair in Episode 2. Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fischer) are just amazing in their roles, and give the movie, it's really needed humor. You know that they kinda dislike each other, but slowly they found caring for each other. That's realistic. The love affair had a shade of grey to it. One memorable exchange of dialogue was partially ad-libbed in which the character professed their love with Han Solo given a badass reply. That was amazing! Without spoiling it, the whole cliffhanger about Han Solo was at least in part due to the fact that they were not sure that Harrison Ford would return for a third film. I glad he did. Another thing, good about the writing is that there isn't a lot of dumb things that question logic in this film, like the other films. I did find a few. I don't like the whole Leia kissing Luke thing. It makes no sense even if Episode VI wasn't made at the time. It's still gross. Another one is how Ben Obi Won Kenobi (Alec Guinness) hide the truth from Luke, throughout the film for no good reason. Why!? You would have thought that information would help Luke deeply before heading to Cloud City! It doesn't make any sense. Once again, without spoiling it. During production, there was great secrecy surrounded the truth about Darth Vader & Luke Skywalker's relationship, to the point that most of the crew didn't know about it. I like how George Lucas fought for this movie. To preserve the dramatic opening sequences of his films, Lucas put the screen credits in the end. Even though this is more common now, this was a highly unusual choice at the time as the Writers and Directors Guilds felt that the credits should be shown first. They fined him and attempted to pull the movie out of theaters. Due to the controversy, he left the Guilds, and the Motion Picture Association. He also left 20th Century Fox over controversy when the President Alan Ladd Jr. got fired for helping fund the sequel, which cause Fox to lose Raiders of the Lost Ark's film rights.

Still, for a film without a real beginning, middle, or end, this one is darn good.Frank Oz' puppetry really reached an apex in the early 1980s, with films like 'Dark Crystal' and 'Empire.' No wonder Yoda made the cover of Time magazine (as Star Wars did several times). The original Yoda is much more whimsical and playful than the 'earlier' Yoda of Episodes I-III. He toys with Luke while dispensing vaguely Confucian wisdom. The facial articulation is very good, and there is a certain palpable reality in physical special effects and good puppetry that the later digital Yoda just did not quite reach; besides the fact that Oz was obviously instructed by Lucas to keep it more serious.Then there is the Oedipal turn the story takes: \"Luke, I am your father.\" I was actually surprised in 1980 when I saw this, and over the years I have gone from judging it corny to a masterstroke. It's probably both. For those who saw Star Wars pre-1980, it's clear that this was not the original plan. Interestingly, George Lucas has done some cleaning up of older movies to conform to the later canon (all but cutting a Luke-Leia kiss in the original that was just not quite brotherly-sisterly enough), but left a lot of it alone, like Obi Wan providing minimal explanation for his 'subterfuge' in the original Star Wars movie.

Han literally gets frozen while Lando takes over for a while, as though there's not room for two of them.Still, I have to give it an 8. It is skillfully crafted for a middle piece, and Lucas really honed his special effects magic some more since the first installment.

The rebels are discovered on the ice planet Hoth, and are promptly defeated by the Imperial Walkers. Our main group is split up into separate teams. Luke, following advice from the force ghost of Obi Wan, seeks out the wise teacher Yoda (a puppet played in a stunningly real performance by puppeteer Frank Oz) who teaches him the true power and meaning of the Force. Leia and Han, along with Chewie, Threepio and R2, are pursued by the Empire for use as bait in a trap by Darth Vader.For a film that has no real beginning or end story-wise, this film has more emotion and character study, exactly what George Lucas and director Irvin Kershner wanted. During his experiences with Yoda, Luke develops an inner conflict about Darth Vader and the Dark Side, and that he must confront this evil in a duel. We as an audience also learn the power of the Force, which is further strengthened as a religious idea, such as Yoda's line, \"You must FEEL the force AROUND you.\" Such material is what makes Empire great, is that we move deeper and deeper into darker and more thoughtful thematic material. The real interesting part of this film is the big reveal in the third act, where Vader reveals Luke's true parentage. It is simply one of the greatest scenes to ever grace the movie screens, and such an emotional pull that we still get lost in the moment even though we all know who he is now.On the opposite side, the stuff on Leia and Han's side of the film is good, but not great. Let me explain. The love story is actually very well done. There's not a lot of smooching and sappy sentiment, but it happens very naturally, along with some banter. Harrison Ford also delivers one of the best improvised lines when Leia says \"I Love You.\" he simply says, \"I know.\" Those are actors who really know their characters. But the rest it seems just to be \"funny\" or unnecessary annoyance. Chewie and Threepio fit into this category, though Threepio is far more interesting than Chewie so... I guess I give him a pass.The rest of the movie is pretty good. The effects are unbelievable, the music is perfect, with John Williams giving us the universally loved \"Imperial March,\" and the terrifying lightsaber duel between Vader and Luke being the highlight of the entire film.Its one of the best of the Saga. I say \"one of the best\" because, for me, this ties with two of the other films, Episodes VI and III. All three of these films are on the top of the game and great films to watch.

There can always be a misfire when it comes to the next chapter of a saga, and this one was one of those films that worried many, many fans. At the same time, however, it was very anticipated. \"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back\" ranks as my second favorite \"Star Wars\" film, following closely behind \"Star Wars: Return of the Jedi\". Most fans would disagree with my arrangement of favorites, yet I don't believe any would disagree with this film getting an outrageous score. That's right. \"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back\" is--simply put--phenomenal. Everything from the scale of the film to the sets to the acting to the writing has improved from the original film.The rebel alliance, at the beginning of this film, are relocated in an icy planet called Hoth. As they wait for Luke to return from his scouting, Han Solo goes on the rescue to save Luke, whom was captured and nearly eaten by a polar bear-like monstrosity. After they return to the rebel base, the Empire locates the rebels with a droid sent to Hoth, and then they invade the area, attempting to find Luke Skywalker and his friends. The base is destroyed, but now Luke must go to Dagoba, in search for Jedi Master Yoda so that he may begin his Jedi training.Once again, Mark Hammill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher (along with every single actor from the original film) make a return for this enormously exciting sequel. However, their performances have taken a huge step upward, crafting one of the best character-based films ever created. This time around, you can practically cut the tension in the air with a lightsaber because of these stupendous performances. It seems like every actor became one with their character even moreso than in the original phenomenon.Another huge step forward was the writing. George Lucas may have created the prequel films in later years, but there is no denying that his writing was extravagant in this particular film. \"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back\" has a deep message along with a--what I consider, at least--better storyline, along with better character arcs. Lucas outdid himself with this screenplay. This film also included one of the most shocking plot twists in film history, and it changed \"Star Wars\" fans forever. This particular scene also became the most quoted line in cinema history, seeing as how revolutionary it had become.One more surprise with this film is that the special effects have gotten ten times better than the original. Everything about this film is perfect, to a tee, when it comes to the special effects. We even get a real lightsaber fight this time around, clocking in at about fifteen minutes long. I wasn't near being born when this film came out, but everyone tells me that this lightsaber battle was so intense that they couldn't control themselves at the the theatres. Even the space scenes look real. The detailing of the scale models used for spaceships were extensive and edgy.\"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back\" is just too perfect. The film was way beyond its time of release, and that is an absolute mouthful.My rating for \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is a complete, well-deserved ten-out-of-ten stars.I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.May the force be with you!

For one, it surpasses the original, which is rare in the sequel department. But it also takes its time to let the story unfold, characters get fleshed out, and the whole thing's a stirring mix of humor, drama and action. Yoda's scenes are some of my favorite of the trilogy. Frank Oz was able to lend that puppet such a personality that it simply becomes a wizened old Jedi master and not a special effect. And Darth Vader's presence in this movie makes him one of the all0time great movie villains. He's unhinged, choking out underlings left and right, and pursuing Luke with reckless abandon. Badass seems kind of trite, but it fits here. \"The Empires Strikes Back\" is a movie that just fires on every last cylinder. Great dialogue, suspense, set pieces and production values.

I was 9 years young when my father took me to see this in the theater. Back then you had to stand in line to see the soonest showing because it only showed once at a time, but boy was it ever worth it. What can possibly be said about this movie that hasn't already been said? How many other movies can you think of where the sequel is just as good, if not better, than the first? I can think of only three; The Godfather Part II, Terminator 2 and Superman 2. It's hard to believe that this film wasn't even nominated, considering The Return Of The King was not only nominated but won best picture; different times I guess. At the time there were a few scenes that shocked me; Han's freezing and the look of him, Luke losing half his arm and right after that learning that Vader is his father. Wow! I recall the scene where Luke goes into that tunnel and light sabers Vader's head off to reveal his own face, scaring the crap out of me. Another thing that was big back then was the merchandising. Lucas got a ton of money from my parents because of this franchise. I had everything that ever came out from trading cards, action figures to even bed sheets. God I wish I had it all still and in it's original packaging. And having just watched this, probably for the 2nd dozenth time, I can tell you that it still holds the test of time.

He has plans for the boy. Skywalker, meanwhile, leaves his friends in the middle of an Imperial invasion for a crash course in Jedi Knighthood amid a desolate swamp world with only a faultfinding green gnome for company. Can Luke complete his training before Darth reels him in?Well, no, actually. That's not the only way this middle installment of the \"Star Wars\" trilogy leaves things on a decidedly more discordant note than the previous, joyous \"Star Wars.\" People call this the darkest of the original three films because it is, but \"Empire\" is the only one with an adult orientation. The characters are deepened, and our investment in them from the first film challenged by events that leave them exposed to the sort of cruelties we wrongly assumed them safe from.George Lucas deserves major praise for putting such a film together, using his well-earned profits from the first film. In essence, he was literally giving the fans back some dividends for their box office proceeds. He also took chances in terms of leaving them less happy this time, knowing the emotional payoff would have to come a film later.\"Empire Strikes Back\" is thus a richer film than \"Star Wars\" emotionally, and in other ways, too. Instead of confining most of the action to the desert planet Tatoonie, the action bounces around from an ice planet to a swamp planet to the most marvelous creation of all, a city hovering high in the clouds of a gas giant, where the action culminates.Lucas adds some interesting new characters, particularly Yoda, the swamp creature Luke goes to for help, who articulates much of the philosophy and provides much of the fun in this film as voiced by Frank Oz, the guy behind (or under) Miss Piggy and later, a talented director in his own right.There's also Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian, the operator of Cloud City who provides much of the needed moral shading in the film as the stars from the previous movie are all full-blown heroes now. Williams has fun schmoozing up Leia and trying to find his feet as his slick machinations leave him in ever-hotter water.The best performance in this film is Mark Hamill's as Luke. Hamill had to work harder here than he did in \"Star Wars,\" sharing all his big scenes with a Muppet and a guy with a bucket on his head. But Hamill finds the essence of a character more interesting than the naive farm boy we saw in the first film, playing Luke as confused, fearful, impetuous, and flawed in a way that makes him more likable, rather than less so. How Hamill never hit it big after his great work here is an injustice on par with Cleavon Little's lack of work after \"Blazing Saddles.\"What else about this is great? The score by John Williams, introducing the recognizable \"Imperial March\" theme music as well as some rousing material during the final confrontation between Luke and Darth. The interaction between Vader and his subordinates is chokingly funny, in a way that only adds to the suspense and dread. The opening battle around the ice planet is marvelously intense, especially as witnessed from the cockpits of Rebel fighters taking on thickly-armored Imperial walkers.The returning cast except for Hamill doesn't seem as sharp this time, especially Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia, so charming in \"Star Wars,\" gaunt and miserable here. Much of the whole middle section of the film is draggy and woolly, like the various silly ways the Millennium Falcon escapes Imperial pursuit and the scene in the \"cave\" that goes on much longer than it should. Even Luke's scenes with Yoda become slow and tedious with multiple viewings.The enthusiasm that makes \"Empire Strikes Back\" so beloved today is understandable. It turned \"Star Wars\" from a great film into an enjoyable franchise.

George Lucas was already planning its sequel, but decided to divide his work with the director Irvin Kershner and screenwriters Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett, many fans were afraid (even with Lucas writing the story), but this group brought the saga to a all-new and unexplored level.\"Empire\" begins shortly after the huge events of its predecessor with the entire rebel army after destroying the \" Death Star\", fleeing through galaxy with the powerful imperial fleet right behind them with ruthless Darth Vader (David Prowse) in command. And with the rebels we see Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) finally realizing his dream of becoming a pilot in the rebel army against the empire, and alongside him his \"inseparable\" friends: the brave and cocky (and Badass) Han Solo (Harrison Ford); the brave and intelligent Leia (Carrie Fisher); the.....Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew); R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels).

Meanwhile, Luke and R2 were able to escape as well, but with the voice instruction from Obi - Wan (Alec Guinness), Luke is advised to go to the Dagobah system and meet the Jedi master Yoda (Frank Oz) which will help Luke know and control the \"strength\", which later will bring him sinister secrets and the sacrifice for his friends.At the time it came-out, the film was poorly received by critics and fans, but perhaps understandable.

While the 1st movie had the great adventure of Luke going to rescue the princess from evil forces in a massive sci-fi style full of humor and thrilling moments. In this one he maintain the great sense of adventure and the humor is not lacking thanks to Han, but here everything is brought to a much more human side thanks to its unforgettable characters.

And also the new and memorable soundtrack from John Williams \"The Imperial March\", you know, that dan dan dan dan dandan dan dandan, dan dan dan dan dandan dan dandan (I know, it's strange to describe a song writing and not listening, well anyway)?!

It combines an appreciably high level of character development with some genuinely exciting and riveting scenes, and introduced the well loved character of diminutive Jedi master Yoda into the formula. Villainous Darth Vader is brought to the forefront rather than being a lackey to somebody else. The relationship between cocky spaceship pilot Han Solo and serious minded rebel leader Princess Leia evolves to where romance can finally take place. And Luke Skywalker becomes more than just the naive and idealistic farm boy, letting his emotions get the better of him.With the directing chores being handed over to Irvin Kershner (\"A Fine Madness\", \"Up the Sandbox\", \"Eyes of Laura Mars\"), \"The Empire Strikes Back\" marks a maturation in terms of story quality, as well as a willingness to go to some dark places. After all, as it begins, it sees its hero in serious jeopardy. It's never treated as a given that Good will prevail. The screenplay is credited to Leigh Brackett (\"The Big Sleep\", \"Rio Bravo\", \"El Dorado\") and Lawrence Kasdan (\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\", \"Body Heat\", \"The Big Chill\"), and stars Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher make the most of the material. The endearing Yoda is one of those examples of a puppet who truly does become a character rather than just a gimmick. The film is a little short on cool aliens, but it does feature a Yeti-like monster called a Wampa, and an enormous slug used in a funny \"worm in the apple\" sort of gag. The spectacle is fantastic, but it never overwhelms the story. The early battle scene on the ice fields of the planet Hoth is incredibly well executed, and the final lightsaber duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader (who of course has a revelation in store for the youngster) offers one thrill after another.The special effects are as impressive as ever, and it would be difficult to hear that memorable John Williams score and not get into the spirit of the thing. You truly care about the characters and want to see what will happen with them.

It has been chanted from the highest hilltops and the most well known critic sites on the internet. It has been said time and time again. Star Wars Episode 5: The Empire Strikes Back is not only the best Star Wars movie, but the best movie sequel ever made, and a prime example of how follow ups can match up and even prevail over their predecessors. While I like the prequels and the film that started it all in 77, The Empire Strikes Back has always been the SW film that glowed the most for me and had the best scenes out of the entire saga. It also introduced my all time favorite Star Wars character and my favorite movie character in general, brought to life by a man who based the character's look and facial expressions off his own. The Empire Strikes Back is the ideal Star Wars film for me, and although it received a mixed reception when it was first released, it has garnished a monstrosity of a following these last couple decades and it shines as one of the greatest sci-fi thrillers with loads of twists and turns to quench your thirst. From the opening battle on the snowy world of Hoth to the final confrontation between Luke and his soon to be revealed father, Darth Vader, this film has a scale, a scope, a powerful, eminent feeling to it. John Williams' exuberant score plays through like an orchestra at an opera and each scene carries suspense and magnitude as you see the events the main characters must live through. As a sequel, it also digs much deeper into the characters' souls and puts them up against powerhouses we never thought they'd go up against, not even in the first movie. Luke Skywalker must train to become a jedi on the swamp planet of Dagobah and at the same time, he must learn what makes the ways of a jedi work. He must be patient and believe in the unbelievable, which is something he fails to do at first (That is why you fail!). He also must learn to avoid the temptations of the dark side and learn what the force is all about. The force is not always about lifting things and tricking people's minds, it's a much bigger entity than Luke could ever imagine, and it's something that touches every life form. In a peanut shell, the force is with everything and allows all creatures to coexist and be bound together as one solid package. This is one of the many lessons Yoda teaches Luke in the second act of the movie.Luke's friends, Han and Leia are also met with extreme challenges in this sci-fi sequel. As they are constantly on the run from the relentless Empire, they must learn ways of hiding and working together for the benefit of surviving the Empire's vicious clawing. Han and Leia must also balance their romantic feelings for one another and learn to get along as well as not let their inner devils get the best of them. But in the realm of seriousness, there is also a bit of comedy and endless excitement. I love Han's relationship with C-3P0 (Never tell me the odds!) and that the Millennium Falcon is always malfunctioning and breaking down. It can't even make the jump to light speed, which it did so frivolously in the first outing. The chase through the asteroid field remains one of my all time favorite scenes out of the saga and John Williams' score for the scene amplifies it's awesomeness. Now let's talk about Yoda, my favorite Star Wars character and movie character of all time. Designed by Stuart Freeborn, Yoda drew inspiration from Albert Einstein, Buddha and even Kermit the Frog, but overall came off as a wise little creature with a brain as big as the galaxy itself. He undeniably has the best dialogue out of the movie and at times, it's hard to believe that Yoda was a puppet and not some real life alien from another world. Luke takes his teachings seriously, but when Vader uses Luke's fears to his advantage (by torturing Han and Leia), he flees in a state of franticness and his inexperience is the main reason why he fails against Vader in the Cloud City \"windy room\". When Darth Vader revealed himself to be Luke's father, many jaws dropped, many undies were pooped, and many gasps were heard throughout the theaters back in 1980. Today, the climatic twist is still as legendary as it was then and it has been lampooned bazillions of times on television shows, parodies and other movies. What makes the scene great is the build up. It's something we weren't expecting and when it came, it smacked us hard in the faces. Of course, there is so much more to talk about, like the Fett man, the awesome Harryhausen style stop motion of the AT-ATS and the tauntauns, the brilliant, exotic looks of the environments and the overall quality of the film, but I've rambled on long enough. The Empire Strikes Back is a mesmerizing experience that still holds up some 33 years later. If you had to watch one Star Wars movie and didn't know which one to watch, why not give this one a viewing. I don't even think you need to see the first film to enjoy this masterpiece, for it's energy and richness makes it stick out like pink hair. It's truly an experience that will leave lifelong lasting memories, so if you need a getaway, take a trip to that galaxy far, far away and let George Lucas' imagination do the talking.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Greatest Sequel To Grace The Screen", "date": "2013-06-15T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2813463", "sentiment score": [0.0018, 0.004, 0.0138, 0.2163, 0.7642]}, {"content": "Star Wars has always and will always be my favorite movie saga of all time.

The regulars are still there, the protagonists and antagonists, making this just as lovable as 'A New Hope', along with the debut of Lando Calrissian and the story-arc and exploration of Hans and Leia.While the entire story is a great work, the film is perhaps most notable for the big scene where it is revealed that Darth Vader is Luke Skywalker's father, a scene which has gone on to become both memorable and quotable, along with the awesome moment when the reveal is said by Darth Vader and 'The Imperial March' starts playing.Time has shown that most movie franchises don't produce particularly great sequels, let alone trilogies, but hats off to George Lucas for doing it right with 'Empire', what a classic!", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Empire", "date": "2013-04-06T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2778312", "sentiment score": [0.0014, 0.005, 0.0375, 0.5559, 0.4001]}, {"content": "This film is for SciFi fans.

That's what life is, a series of down endings. All Jedi had was a bunch of Muppets.\" - Dante Hicks, Clerks.One of my other justifications for remaining ignorant to the Star Wars franchise was the fact that I felt I had already seen them before. After hearing the above lines in Kevin Smith's Clerks, I had no ambition to seek out the series because of the fact that I already knew all, or most, of the major, visceral plot points in the second installment, The Empire Strikes Back. But even knowing these details going in, I still emerged as enthralled and as taken as ever. It's one of the most awe-inspiring, gripping sequels I've ever seen.My love for the series of Star Wars, so far, has likely been because I don't try to understand it all. I allow myself to sink into the films, letting the film's imagination, and my own, take me on a cinematic Odyssey. The less I look into the meaning of it all and the interworkings of the characters and series, the more, I feel, I see in terms of vision, writing, atmosphere, and style. Thank goodness I took this approach to The Empire Strikes Back, which employs all these elements with slick, constant entertainment. It abandons the cheery, free-spirited style of its predecessor in favor of a much dark enigma. Never before have I seen a film go from comforting entertainment to sheer calamity within one sequel.Perhaps much of this is thanks to Irvin Kershner, who takes over for Lucas in the directing department. After achieving monstrous success with the original Star Wars, against all conceivable odds, Lucas, who was perplexed at how to follow up the hit, sidelined himself to executive producer and hired Kershner to lend his vision with the screen. New writers by the names of Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan were hired to continue the harrowing tales of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), and Han Solo (Harrison Ford). I couldn't imagine the hesitation amongst fans when these creative decisions were made. They must've expected the absolute worst from a sequel to an explosive hit. Could it be like the extreme hesitation the Star Wars fanbase currently has now with J.J Abrams manning the camera and Michael Ardnt writing the script for the forthcoming Star Wars: Episode VII in 2015, or should I not even mention that? The wonderful thing about these new faces being the driving forces behind this film is that we get a different spin on these characters and their lives that isn't drab, redundant, or contrived. Had The Empire Strikes Back adopted the same sort of easy-going charisma of its predecessor, this could've easily been a cheap rehash of previously successful material. Instead, Kerschner, Brackett, and Kasdan wisely choose to further develop these characters, making their problems more three-dimensional, their personalities more vivid, and their biographies more interesting.Again, there are some terrific and grandiose special effects put to use here. The effects on the Millennium Falcon and the exterior shots of a galaxy far, far away is just marvelous and very appealing on the eyes. I'm always amazed at the naturalism of these effects, even for the late seventies/early eighties. Despite being largely products of computers and other visual mediums, they still possess an authentic and wonderfully realistic look to them.One particular instance is when Han, Leia, and the rest of the gang fly their ship into the asteroid farm, which is exactly what it sounds like. Dozens of asteroids hurl themselves at the ship at breakneck speeds, leaving Han (the driver) with little time to react and dodge them. The animation and visual technique of the asteroids is astonishing, and every moving object adopts gorgeous fluency and technical precision. It's a visual wonder to say the very least.The Empire Strikes Back beautifully carries the Star Wars franchise further than it might've even gone under the intense and uncompromising care of Lucas himself. The new faces delightfully provide us with more entertaining adventures and more eccentric characters such as Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz) and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), consistently keeping us in-tuned and intrigued with the limitless possibilities of this creative world. Like before, Hamill, Fisher, and Ford provide the most likable of chemistry, and the scenes of intensity and peril do not fall short of enthralling, even if one is aware of the outcome. There are many directions Return of the Jedi can take, but if it shows the gripping intensity of its predecessor and the truly mysterious nature of its original, then the possibilities are as endless as the galaxy the series inhabits.Starring: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford, James Earl Jones, Frank Oz (voice), and Billy Dee Williams.

Unlike Lucas who was a special effects visionary, Kershner instead focuses on story and characters, most notably the human face.The story takes place most likely a few years after the first film. With the Death Star destroyed Luke and the Rebel Aliance is forced to go on the run and into hiding on a remote ice planet Hoth. Meanwhile Darth Vader does everything in his power to find Luke and bring him to his Emperor in order to train him to become the next Sith apprentice. Afterwords many things happen: Romance is formed in the middle of battle, Shocking revelations are discovered that change everything and new things are discovered about \"The Force\" that are almost zen like by a new character named Yoda (performed and voiced by the great Frank Oz).Everything about this movie is phenomenal. The story takes a darker and more personal turn leading to better character development. The action scenes are amazing, epic and well shot and the dialog is so memorable that its embedded into our pop culture. Anybody who knows \"No...I am your father.\" or \"I know\" should know what I'm talking about.(Give some credit to George Lucas,the late Leigh Brackett(who also co-wrote the original \"The Big Sleep\") and Lawrence Kasdan for delivering a great script.) As for acting its just excellent. James Earl Jones and David Prowse give their most menacing combination performance that reminds us why Darth Vader is one the most memorable villains in cinema history. Mark Hamil's Luke is angsty but a little more mature from the last movie. Carie Fisher and Harison Ford share great chemistry. Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker are great comedic relief as always giving some levity to even the most darkest of times. Frank Oz does a wonderful job as Yoda who becomes Luke's new mentor in \"The Force\". Alec Guinness returns as Obi Wan Kenobi who guides Luke to Yoda in spirit form. Billy Dee Williams stars as a new character Lando Calrissian. Elaine Baker's face and Clive Revill's voice give us a very chilling first time view of the Emperor and lets not forget the one scene wonder bounty hunter Boba Fett played by Jeremy Bullochband voiced by Jason Wingreen. (Combination performances seem to happen a lot in \"Star Wars\" Hmmm) One last thing I should mention is the amazing score by John Williams and the London Symphony Orchestra which gives us one of the more memorable and chilling music pieces for Darth Vader the \"Imperial March\". \"The Empire Strikes Back\" stands as one of the best sequels and one of the best movies of all time.

Escapist movies such as Star Wars and Raiders shouldn't take themselves too seriously, and it hurts Empire a bit..but just a bit. This is still a fun ride. That said, it does take Empire a lot longer to get out of the gate than the the first one did. After a long slow buildup, there's that great battle scene on the ice planet Hoth (where we first see the Imperial walkers). After getting driven from Hoth, two stories emerge: While Han Solo, Princess Leia, C3PO and Chewbacca are hiding from Darth Vader in an asteroid field, Luke Skywalker(with R2D2) is off on this rat hole of a planet in the Degaba system to learn about the Force (he gets a vision from Obi Wan early in the movie telling him to go there). This brings us to a character beloved by a majority of Star Wars fans yet reviled by me. I'm of course talking about the sanctimonious muppet (later CGI image) Yoda. Despite the fact that I found his character so annoying, the detail with regard to Yoda's facial expressions (his eyes in particular) was amazing back in a time long before CGI. Luke starts to learn about the Force (in what must be a crash course when you compare it to the \"prequels\"), but leaves when he sees visions of his friends in trouble, and despite Yoda's admonishments, goes to help them. This is where Luke starts getting irritating. He knows Vader is setting a trap for him, yet lets his emotions totally get the best of him and goes anyway. Makes you wonder if you want to leave the future of the galaxy in the hands of someone this flaky.Luke isn't quite as much fun as he was in the first one, but the other characters make up for it. The back and forth between Han and Leia is even funnier than in the previous movie. In fact, this movie is Solo's finest hour (good thing, because the subsequent carbon freeze he went through apparently softened his brain). If you wanted to take the essence of everything I love about Solo and bottle it, it would come down to two words: I know. Speaking of which, the love story between Han and Leia (which culminated in those two words) was handled just right..the movie didn't dwell on it, though the sexual tension was evident in the way the two of them sniped at each other early on.Darth Vader was his bad self..even more in this movie than the first one (and even less patient with fools, as a couple of imperial officers found out the hard way). The fight between Luke and Vader in the 2nd half was where the movie started to degenerate into taking itself too seriously. Star Wars doesn't do as well when it gets too dramatic. The visuals are great though.Rounding out rest of the characters, Billy Dee Williams is fine as Han's old pirate buddy Lando, though his character and Solo's were pretty similar. Then there was the single most over-hyped character in Star Wars, Boba Fett (I think he had all of two lines). C3PO and R2D2 were great, but they were separated for much of this movie..they work better together. Chewbacca's best moment was early in the movie when he was laughing at Solo after Leia insulted him..It bugged me for a long time that this movie didn't really end..that it left you hanging for three years until the next one came out (as in leaving Han Solo in carbon freeze). I finally got past that, realizing that in a sense it does \"end\"..our heroes live to fight another day, but only after taking a serious beating for most of the movie.

And 5 percent of the time it's awesome and arguably better than the original! For me, The Empire Strikes Back is one of those 5 percent! And for me it is slightly better than the original, and one of my all time favorite movies! Following the worldwide success of Star Wars, Lucas quickly published that he would be writing a sequel, using ideas he couldn't fit in the original movie. This time Irvin Kershner would be directing the Star Wars flick. It went on to gross about as much money as the original, and it preceded the expectations for a Star Wars sequel! The Empire Strikes Back doesn't try to top the original at any point! The Empire Strikes Back takes off not long after the end of Star Wars! Luke, Han and Leia are now key fighters in The Rebellion, and Darth Vader is hot on the trail in the pursuit of Luke! Like Joss Whedon is planning to do with the Avengers 2, The Empire Strikes Back is a much more darker and personal movie flick, than the original movie was! The acting is much better as the actors have bonded with and understands their characters much better. The character development is better in this movie, even to the point where Leia and Han gets intimate! The movie is just downright equally as exciting and entertaining as the original, has tons of memorable dialog and scenes and an incredible story serving as a follow-up to the original! Gotta' give George Lucas credit for that! Luke Skywalker has become a professional resistance fighter, and well on the way to become a Jedi at this point! His acting is better, and his character is more interesting! Same goes for Carrie Fisher as Leia Organa! Harrison Ford is still as badass and as entertaining as in the first, and this time he's even got a really memorable line! Darth Vader is much more sinister in this movie, than in the original! He's got more really memorable lines, his character is much deeper and more ruthless! Darth Vader will always be my all-time favorite villain for this movie alone! Billy Dee Williams also debuts as a new smuggler and badass character!

Great action sequences, great acting and above all the biggest twist of all time! Story: The Rebels have built a new base of operations called Echo Base on the ice planet Hoth after the Empire chased them off Yavin IV in response to the Death Star being destroyed. It's not long before the Empire discovers their new hideout and force the Rebels once again to flee from the invasion of Imperial AT-AT walkers. Princess Leia, Han Solo, Chewbacca and C-3PO escape in the Millennium Falcon, but are later captured by Darth Vader on Cloud City with Han Solo being frozen in carbonite and handed over to Boba Fett who takes him back to Jabba the Hutt.

During his training, he sees visions of Leia, Han and Chewbacca being kidnapped by Vader and sets out to Cloud Cit to rescue them, only get into a confrontation with Darth Vader where he discovers the most shocking secret about Vader.Everything in this film is close to perfect as you can get: The battle of Hoth is one of my favorite movie battle scenes ever, and the music once again makes it awesome. The asteroid field pursuit is entertaining as hell, and the light saber fight between Luke and Darth Vader... it's basically indescribable. The acting once again is fantastic with Mark Hamill once again giving another solid performance as a young impatient Luke Skywalker who fails every task given to him by Yoda, Harrison Ford once again owning the role of Han Solo and his interactions with Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) make for some really entertaining dialogue. I also like seeing how their relationship actually grows from love/hate to a love relationship, especially since Han grows throughout the trilogy. Billy Dee Williams as Lando brings his own brand of charm to brighten the mood up until he is forced to betray Han, but redeems himself by turning against the Empire and helping Leia attempt to save Han. As for Yoda, he is so awesome in this one! Frank Oz's puppetry is so terrific that it's better than anything CGI can do today (not that I despise CGI). I love the scenes where he's training Luke on Dagobah, especially the part where he goes \"Not this crude matter!\" Darth Vader is more evil than he was in the first one. He's killing lieutenants left and right that it makes me go, \"I'll do whatever you want, just please don't choke me!\" As for the big twist where he says \"I am your father\" to Luke, it still gets me every time. I can't remember the first time I heard him say that line because I was like 5 or 6 years old when I first watched \"Empire\" but when he says it and you hear that music playing in the background and the look on Luke's face... you still feel that shock that Luke feels.It goes without saying that this is not only the best Star Wars movie ever, this is one of the best MOVIES ever made. As for sequels surpassing the predecessor, for me it's right up there with \"The Godfather Part 2\", \"The Dark Knight\", \"Spider-Man 2\" and \"T2 - Judgement Day\".

Slowly, Lucas reveals certain things and Luke is attacked. We are then told of a hidden Rebel base on the snowy mountain of Hoth. After a probe droid investigates the area, its destroyed and this gives the Empire a chance to get revenge on the destruction of the Death Star.Han Solo continues to be a mystery. He seems like he may just leave, but turns back to save the day. That scene with Luke using all the power he had to get the lightsaber off the snow was one legendary scene as the music build up just steals it! The Battle of Hoth then ensues. Again, it doesn't focus on SPECIAL EFFECTS. And we see some AT-AT's and some Rebel ships led by Luke Skywalker. We see a new Imperial leader by the name of Veers. The tension is in the air for some really special film.After Han, Leia and Chewie along with the two droids escape Hoth from Vader, we are immediately into the story. Vader pursues the Millennium Falcon and hires bounty hunters to bring Han to him in order to get Luke to the dark side (that's after they figure out he's strong with the force). Luke goes to Dagobah and every scene there had something very special. The scene with Yoda lifting up Luke's TIE fighter was one legendary scene. This WAS the Yoda. A mystery to all. His quote \"size matters not\" has now being destroyed in the prequels where he jumps around to make up for his size.Eventually, Luke falls for Vader's trap and gets himself to Bespin. Han is betrayed by his friend Lando to Vader. Vader prepares to carbonate him and test it to see if it will kill or not. After Han is frozen, Luke arrives and sets for the most legendary lightsaber duel of all time (Not that prequel crap).This scene between Luke and Vader has so much tension and emotion that the prequels lacked. The scenes with Lando, Leia and Chewie getting off Bespin was also cool. I mean, how much cooler could Lando be? He's the second best SW character to me now!

If the first film was largely about heroism, the second is largely concerned with struggle. The main characters are soundly tested in this film and for the most part, they come up short.This is also the film that transforms Darth Vader into one of the screen's great villains. Vader was interesting in 'Star Wars,' but he is iconic in 'The Empire Strikes Back' and he rightfully takes his place as not only a great villain, but a great character. In spite of the despair that runs through the film, the visuals and imagination so apparent in 'Star Wars' returns here, as well. The film is littered with awesome action sequences and more than enough 'coolness' to measure up to its predecessor.Again, the original (1980) version is the one to see - if given the option - although the enhancements made to this film are somewhat less invasive than those applied to 'Star Wars.'

That's not saying that \"Empire\" didn't run into its fair share of problems, but regardless, this feels much more polished than \"Star Wars,\" and that is saying a LOT.Now, I certainly think that \"Star Wars\" is one of the greatest motion pictures of all times, a fantastic, A+, perfect film. The sequel, \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" however, is a complete game changer. Everything is bigger and better than ever. The visual effects are superior to the already impressive originals, and the actions sequences are more explosive, but even from a storytelling standpoint, \"Empire\" takes things to a whole new level.The story continues with Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia, and the rest of the gang at the Rebel base on the ice planet Hoth, but following an attack by an Imperial fleet, the team is split up, with Luke setting out to the Dagobah system to train with the ancient Jedi master Yoda, and the rest of the gang evading capture by the evil Darth Vader, who is back and more villainous than ever. The story this time around is much darker, much more mature, and more fleshed out. It develops the story without being a mere retread of the previous film, and yet, it still maintains that trademark Star Wars feel that made the first one so good. The comic relief is sharper and wittier, the characters are developed in a really natural and fascinating way, and the new characters like Yoda, Boba Fett, and Lando Calrissian also perfectly find their niche in Star Wars lore, fitting in perfectly with the rest.All in all, \"The Empire Strikes Back\" takes everything that made the first film so fantastic, and improves it significantly, and then turns it on its head. If \"Star Wars\" is one of the best sci-fi fantasy films ever made, then \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is THE best sci-fi fantasy film ever made. One of the few perfect films in history.

Attempting a sequel to a movie of such magnitude, while an exciting prospect from the movie goers' perspective, is a suicidal task for the crew behind the same. One can only imagine the immense pressure of expectations that the makers of this film would have gone through while making this movie and even more so when the movie eventually saw the light. However, this movie not only fulfills all such hopes that fans of the first movie would have from the sequel but takes the Star Wars franchise into an even better and exciting territory, and improving upon the minor flaws of the first, turns out to be an adventure that can be regarded as good as perfect in all aspects of film-making. Although I had gotten a slight hint of this from the forums and internet talk, I now realize why this is regarded as the best movie in the Star Wars universe.There's little need to get into the plot as it is best experienced by watching the movie directly. To describe it in short though, Darth Vader is desperately after Luke Skywalker and wants to turn him to the dark side. In an attempt to capture him, he plans to use his friends Han Solo and Princess Leia as bait. Meanwhile, Luke, guided by Obi-Wan Kenobe's voice through the mystical Force must travel to Dagobah where he must learn the true ways of a Jedi Knight in order to confront the evil lord Darth Vader.Once again, all the elements that made the original Star Wars a success abound in the sequel. There's a well conceived story put together in place, great writing and editing that makes all the sequences feel connected to each other allowing them all to flow together, there's the original cast giving better performances this time being more aware of their characters, and of course, there's the by now famous Star Wars opening musical piece. Lucas, busy handling his newly established visual effects house and finances, hands over the directorial reins to his trusted professor Irvin Kershner. A professor at the University of Cinema Sciences, the way he handles the epic sequences while at the same time concentrating on expanding and developing the characteristic traits of the main cast gives the film an emotional depth which was sorely lacking in the original movie and which was one of my complaints with that film - the characters there were appeared too flat and devoid of personality as though they were just going through the motions. The presence of some character development this time allows us to connect with them even better which in turn makes the situations in which they get involved in a lot more engaging. Amongst all, the character of Han Solo as a dependable \"scoundrel\" is what really stands out; Ford plays him out in a near perfect way which is not only consistent with what Solo was in the first film, but also takes it in a further positive direction. His sequences with Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia are amongst the high points of the movie and are brilliantly played out. We also see Mark Hamill as a now slightly more mature Luke Skywalker as he journeys to Dagobah to learn the ways of a true Jedi from the strangely voiced Yoda. And of course there's the inseparable duo of C-3PO and R2-D2 who are actually forced to stay apart from each other for a major portion of this movie. As much as I can admit to not being able to understand anything R2 says, I have inexplicably grown to like his presence immensely in Star Wars.The film features visual effects and action on a scale that's almost twice as big as its predecessor (the budget only confirms this). Spending $32 million on a movie in 1980 would not have been regarded as a wise decision but thank goodness that Lucas decided to go for it or we might not have been able to witness space battles on such a huge scale. The battle on the ice planet at the start of the movie is brilliantly staged and a behind the scenes documentary sheds some light on how some of these miraculous shots were achieved. What's really great about the action is that unlike the heavily edited action sequences of present films wherein the average shot just lasts for about 2-3 seconds, shots in Star Wars last longer making the action very comprehensible and easy to follow. Its easy to see the strategies being adopted by each side while fighting as opposed to units just being brought down by random shots fired by people / creatures obscured by the miss-mash editing. And the best sequence of the movie comes towards the end in an epic battle between Luke and Darth Vader that literally will send your pulse racing. Even more exciting is the battle's infamous outcome which I shall not reveal.Movies like The Empire Strikes Back come only once in a while. Perhaps, every decade must have only a few of these movies present. Fans would obviously come up with a few nitpicks here and there but as far as my opinion goes, this movie is perfect in every aesthetic and area of film-making I'm ever aware of. Now that this movie has set such high standards for the Star Wars saga, I wonder where the next movies will take me. Suffice it to say, The Empire Strikes Back strikes a positive blow from which recovery is simply not possible. A winner all the way !!!

In this one George Lucas gathers a virtuously designed nexus between the fifth and the 6th movie of the saga. However, this movie is by no means fault of action or memorable moments. Here we discover the relationship that lies between Luke and Darth Vader. George places us in front a very decisive moral dilemma: Will young Luke grow prey of fear and hate like his father? or by the contrary, will he become a jedi?;or in other words: will he save the day and defeat Darth Vader? or will he join him and Palpatine, screwing it all up? I was glad to see that in this movie, the hard challenge to which the actors were subjected was passed by all of them flawlessly. I was specially thrilled by the way mark Hamill succeeds in showing us with great sophistication the metamorphosis Luke is undergoing, evolving from an ignorant crybaby, into a mighty and wiser jedi. The way his motifs become more altruistic and less egocentric in such an adverse situation makes us watch a man handling a light saber and no longer a boy. This simply broadens the range of ages that will be adhered to this particular movie. Carrie fisher and Harrison ford excel at their role and add the necessary spice to the film. Resorting to the child-pleasing comedy provided by C3PO or R2D2 was thankfully not a major concern in this movie.As I expressed, in my opinion the dialog is more adult-compelling. Nonetheless(and I see this as a positive thing) we don't have to deal with insufferable doses of complex political debates which were a constant in the first trilogy, were the rise to power of Palpatine was explained.The empire strikes back was more of a character- based movie. Here we are more concerned about the growing affection between Han and Leia and the evolution of Luke and his understanding of the force, than we are concerned about the oppression of the republic on the rebel forces. With this movie, one can notice that a family is beginning to be forged. We can feel this through the fears and preoccupations of the troop as each particular character confronts successive threats (e.g when Han is frozen into carbonate)Visuals in this movie are breathtaking. I was impressed when I watched the arrival of the millennium falcon to Cloud City or where Han and his cohort were escaping the clone offensive (near the start of the movie). The CG textures were noticeably polished from the previous movie. This film was able to isolate me from the real world and to induce me to a thrilling utopia.The 'epicnes' of the music and sound effects cannot be exaggerated, but as Lord Sith said, \"I had fore-seen this\". Music is always topnotch in the saga.The argument was inventive and unpredictable all along. The movie broke free from fantasy films monotony and did not end with a \"happily ever after\".This felt very refreshing for me.This only leaves me to add: CONGRATULATIONS GEORGE! you're the best at what you do! and thank you for providing me with a world were my mind can teleport to to find true joy every once in a while.

That honor goes to STAR WARS:EPISODE V,THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (ESB)(1980). ESB is that rare sequel that manages to top it's predecessor. Make no mistake, though, ANH is still as magical, pure, and fun a flick as it was in 1977 when I first saw it as a kid! But ESB ups the ante and succeeds in it's own depiction of the Star Wars universe. In reality, ESB is in basic tone the antithesis of ANH, which is a big reason why I think that BOTH films stand the test of time! If your in the mood for a fast-paced, imaginative adrenaline-rush of pure action-adventure, then pop in ANH! But if you want imagination combined with character depth and detail, mystery, mood, and atmosphere, then ESB is more your cup of tea! Mark Hamill (reprising the role that made him famous, Luke Skywalker) gets to show some acting chops in ESB, but he doesn't do a complete character 180, thankfully! Hamill still imbibes Luke with the same youthful vigor and eagerness, but with just a touch of more maturity as Luke is now a Jedi-in-training, preparing to take on the despicable Darth Vader (the iconic character created from the original, voiced by James Earl Jones and played by David Prowse). While in ANH, Vader had a smaller role (just force-choking snotty imperial officers and looking intimidating), here in ESB, Vader is a major player and more fleshed out and much scarier as he exudes menace and fear throughout the film.On the planet Dagobah with his trusty sidekick, the all-purpose droid R2D2, Luke's training in the arts of the Jedi Knights is led by, IMHO, the greatest character of ALL Star Wars films...drum roll, please?!....Master YODA! A brilliant puppet creation, created by Muppets creator Jim Henson and voiced by Frank Oz, Yoda has more personality and depth than most human characters I've ever seen in film! While Obi-Wan Kenobi (reprised by Sir Alec Guiness in a cameo role as a Force Ghost) laid the foundation for the Force in ANH, Yoda builds the house in ESB! Whatever this mystical \"Force\" is, Yoda makes you believe! My favorite scenes in ESB are between Luke and Yoda, on a swamp planet no less! Also returning are Harrison Ford (as the dashing rascal pilot Han Solo) and Carrie Fisher (as the feisty, forward Princess Leia). Navigating their way through asteroids and space monsters along with Han's Wookie sidekick Chewbacca and hilarious protocol droid C3P0, Han and Leia's story is told in parallel to Luke's as they all must go their separate ways to escape the wrath of the Empire until they can re-join the Rebel fleet. Ford and Fisher's natural chemistry shines through in ESB as Han and Leia bring out the best (and sometimes worst!) in each other in an enjoyable love-hate pairing.Surprising cast addition Billy Dee Williams also gives a convincing performance as Lando Calrissian, Han's old friend and leader of Cloud City Bespin, where Han and Leia seek temporary refuge from the Empire.While slower in storytelling and darker than it's predecessor, ESB still manages to entertain with a wonderful script, excellent acting, a provocative plot, and great action sequences, including the opening battle on the ice-planet Hoth, the asteroid scene, and concluding with an awesome light-saber showdown (probably the best in all the films) between Luke and Vader on Bespin. Given that it was made 30+ years ago, the special effects in ESB are still eye-popping and quite impressive. Interesting is that, George Lucas, the 'name' most associated with Star Wars, has very little to do with the result of this great film. It was directed by Irvin Kershner, written by Lawrence Kasdan, and scored by of course John Williams.

Suddenly, a self-avowed abstract filmmaker was the center of media and fan attention. Star Wars became a hot name in cinema, so a sequel was demanded by almost everyone.The good thing of the original \"Star Wars\" was that it was made resembling classic Sci-Fi serials in the 40s and the 50s, such as Flash Gordon, so it had an episodic feel: at the end of the original movie, there were many \"plot-threads\" open to explore: Luke becoming a Jedi, Darth Vader, the fate of the rebellion, etc. So, after three years of production, came \"The Empire Strikes Back\". And it didn't disappoint.The movie somewhat loses the light and charming mood of the original, but replaces it with character development, drama and concept exploration. The space adventure feel is more serious this time: it's not the scenario of \"saving the princess\" anymore, rather a cat and mouse chase, with a feeling of doom surrounding the characters. There is learning, adventure, introspection, confrontation, betrayal, revelations, and at the end, a well crafted cliffhanger, leading to the next movie.\"Empire\" is somewhat more respected by Sci-Fi fans than the original \"Star Wars\", maybe because it took itself more seriously than the last one. The first movie had the mood of a \"fairy tale in space\". This one has more dramatic and introspective tones, and a more dreadful scenario. At the end, the fate of one of the main characters is left unknown for the audience: this movie took risks.To summarize, this is not in the same vein as the original \"Star Wars\", but it has an excellent development, story and tone, which makes this movie an enjoyable experience and an endurable classic.

I had never heard of Campbell until this time. I would later find out, that Campbell was the writer who influenced George Lucas. After reading several of Campbell's books and meeting with Venosta, I thought about writing the sequel to the Last Dragon, but then realized that I needed to write my own story.As a native New Yorker, and someone who could have lost his life during 9/11, I felt that a story needed to be made.

It has no structure, no dialogue, no screenplay, a threadbare story, but one that is not told because of non-existent direction, etc. It continues where the original left off, and just notches off plot elements one by one without any urge to tell a story, or develop characters, relationships, etc. The makers probably conceived this as a filler between numbers one and three and didn't bother with it. Of course, that's all right. I don't have any problem with that. But what really does disturb me is the high praise meted out to this \"film\" from almost every quarter \u2013 from viewers and critics alike. On this board it's being rated as the 17th best movie of all time. I've consulted quite a few film guides, and they all tag maximum, or near maximum, stars to this film. Even more bizarrely, they consider it to be the best of the series, and in my mind it's clearly the worst. What is going on? Of course, it's not difficult to see why this film is idolized. The first film was both good and a milestone. Not great, but it was the perfect statement for an age. It was a fairy tale that was confused as science fiction. The \"Force\" embodied morality, even religion, for the space age. It is set in the distant past and therefore pertains to origins rather than where technology is going. Spaceships and laser guns are just the backdrop, and have nothing to do with the story or the subject matter. When this film appeared in the middle of the crisis-ridden seventies, it really must have been a beacon of \"new hope\". And to put the ground-breaking special effects into its proper context, they symbolized optimism. There is no doubt that the effects served the story well, but they served even better the mood of the age. And with all this going, Star Wars rightly became a tremendous hit, and the focus of fanatic devotion. It was to be expected that any sequel would have been gobbled up by the fan base, as long as it didn't spoil the original. Empire doesn't spoil the original. It not only continues the war between good and evil, it does so with more spectacle, more aplomb, more special effects.When people say they like Empire, what I think they really mean is that thy like Star Wars so much that they are thrilled that it has a new and glossy wrapping. Because Empire is nothing but embellishment. They're not judging the film itself. The ideal situation would have been if Star Wars remained as a standalone fairy tale. Fairy tales end, and they leave us with the aura of \"happily ever after\". They don't go on and on and become sagas, and if they did that would totally destroy the aura. Empire is the first mistaken step towards saga, and that is why it quickly finds itself out of its depth. There is nothing else to be told, and that's why the film is so bad. One boring battle joined to another boring battle, and in between we have cardboard characters mouthing atrocious dialogue that serves no purpose whatsoever. The strain tells. Everybody is straining to do something when there is nothing to do. The third film, The Return of the Jedi, redeems itself by trying to finish a story. The prequels are interesting because they are filling in the background. But Empire is caught in no man's land. It is bad, and it should be exposed as such.

While many people would claim this is the best Star Wars movie, it really isn't\u0085and it isn't even close.Which doesn't mean Empire isn't a great film. The last 25 minutes or so are as good as anything in Star Wars and there's plenty before that to keep you entertained. But I think folks get caught up in how much bigger, bolder and darker this sequel is compared to the first movie and don't notice the little cracks that run throughout the story.Empire picks up the story of Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and the rebellion against the Empire at least a few years after the events of Star Wars. The rebels have just settled in to a new secret base when Luke gets bushwacked by a snow monster and sees an image of Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness) telling him to go to the Dagobah system and be trained by Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz). A probe droid leads the Empire to the Rebel base and after a big battle, Luke sets off for Dagobah while Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and company get trapped by the Empire and eventually have to flee to Cloud City, where Han's old friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) will help them repair the Millennium Falcon and hide from the Empire. As Luke trains, we learn that Darth Vader (David Prowse and James Earl Jones) is desperate to find Luke and considers his Jedi potential to be extremely valuable or extremely dangerous to the Empire. Vader eventually lures Luke to Cloud City, where we get one of the all time great revelations in movie history, and witness our heroes battle to survive.Empire is definitely a bigger film than Star Wars. There's far more action on a much grander scale with more speed and thrills. But a lot of the big effects in Empire have not aged that well. Watching Empire, you can sort of understand how George Lucas became obsessed with going back and fixing things in the original trilogy.This is also one of the boldest movie blockbusters ever. The story is basically about how our heroes fail over and over and over again and barely escape by the skin of their teeth. And these are real failures, where Luke and Han aren't smart enough or strong enough or good enough to succeed, not flukes or situations where winning is impossible. Empire is very much about how the characters we loved from the first movie fall short and get beaten down.Which is one of the things that make it much darker than Star Wars or any other SW movie, except perhaps Revenge of the Sith. But that's not all. Star Wars was largely the story of Luke Skywalker growing from a boy to a man, but in a triumphant, cheerful, fairy tale sort of way. It's a hero's story. Empire is also about a boy becoming a man, but not in triumph. This is a story about Luke becoming an adult and learning that the world doesn't work the way children think it does. This is a story of lost innocence.Empire is a great movie and I don't want to overly criticize it, but you can see some basic problems compared to Star Wars. It doesn't really have a central plot propelling things along. For a big budget sci-fi spectacle, Empire is rather like one of those art house films where stuff just happens to the characters. The story also breaks up the Luke/Leia/Han triangle suggested in Star Wars and leaves Leia with little to do in this film other than be the foil for Han's amorous advances. And while the story is more adult in some ways, it's also simpler. There was a lot of stuff in Star Wars that suggested a wider universe in which that particular story was only a part. Empire shrinks everything down and links everything together in a much less sophisticated way. Darth Vader also becomes almost cartoonishly evil in Empire after having a core of believability in Star Wars. Although, the story does do a good job of illustrating how being that evil is ultimately self-defeating. And there's a lot of little comedic bits crammed into the story, with most of it C-3PO related. It's not as bad a Jar Jar Binks, but it's a step down that road.One of the other striking things about Empire is seeing puppet Yoda again after getting used to CGI created characters. There's no denying that while puppet Yoda looked great in 1980, now he really looks fake. But puppet Yoda actually seems more alive than the CGI Yoda of the prequels. Puppet Yoda looks fake but feels real, while CGI Yoda looks real but feels fake. It think it must be because puppet Yoda was mostly the creation of a single artist, allowing his talent and personality to shine through, while CGI Yoda was a product that was sort of manufactured by a large team.A lot of people say Empire was as good as it was because people other than George Lucas played such a big role in making it. But noticing the weaknesses in Empire really only emphasizes how great a job Lucas did in Star Wars\u0085which also emphasizes how poorly he did when it came to making the prequels.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Not the best Star Wars movie", "date": "2010-09-17T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2311816", "sentiment score": [0.0142, 0.1788, 0.5794, 0.2172, 0.0103]}, {"content": "Sequel to the 1977 smash hit follows Luke Skywalker (Hamill) training to be a Jedi from the lovable new character Yoda (Oz), while his friends are pursued by Darth Vader (Prowse/Jones), who himself has a life-changing secret.

The first is the relationship between Han Solo and Leia Organa, which is touched upon in a New Hope, but is fleshed out more in this film. The other is the more central relationship between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. This relationship is also linked in to the main supporting character in this film, Yoda, who is fantastically well realised by the film crew and performed brilliantly by Frank Oz. There are other characters, but whereas C3P0 and R2D2 were a central part of the story in the previous film, they are more on the sidelines.What makes this film so great though is the involving and effective way the relationships operate within the broader story. The banter between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher is highly effective and amusing, operating through the classical love-hate relationship. One senses that Kershner, as a director of character driven films, worked very effectively with the actors and gave them the space to develop their characters which meant plenty of choices for the director in terms of their performances. The same goes for Mark Hamill's interaction with Yoda(Frank Oz). This is totally convincing and builds up the confrontation with Darth Vader very well. It was time well spent in getting these performances right. Kershner is very good at keeping the performance naturalistic, but reduces the level of broadness in the characters, making them more complex and interesting. Darth Vader benefits from this with scenes in the film that add to the mystique of the character. The confrontation with Luke Skywalker is riveting and dramatic and elevates the film above the level of its predecessor. Technically the film is even more impressive than its predecessor. Credit has to go the Oscar nominated Art Direction team. John Barry, who had worked on the previous film, passed away during the production, but Norman Reynolds led the team superbly, with the excellent creations of Dagobah and Hoth, albeit Bespin in the original does feel a bit like a set, and the digital embellishments in the special edition were helpful in creating a bigger feel to those scenes. However, I was disappointed in the reworked scene with Palpatine in the special edition - while putting the excellent Ian McDiarmid was supporting continuity, to show him face on was, in my view an error and the reworked scene would have played much better with his face shrouded, or at the least partially obscured. The whole point of the scene was that the dialogue as strong enough without the need to ram an unsubtle visual at the audience. Editing is excellent, led by Star Wars veteran Paul Hirsch, but it is known that both George Lucas, and his then wife Marcia were also heavily involved in putting the film together. Peter Suschitzky's photography is more conventional and low key in approach than A New Hope, but is particularly effective on the Dagobah scenes in Elstree Studios, and the location scenes in Norway. ILM's visual effects were outstanding, and rightly won an Academy Award. The crew consisted of the following: Oscar winning A New Hope veteran Richard Edlund, working with British effects supervisor Brian Johnson (who had just won an Oscar for Alien), effects photographer Dennis Muren (who would become an award winning and digital effects pioneer for ILM for ET, Return of the Jedi, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Innerspace, The Abyss, T2 and Jurassic Park) and compositor Bruce Nicholson, who would go on to win an Oscar for his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark, and work on a wide variety of films in Hollywood. George Lucas took a strong interest and influence in the special effects and also has to take credit for some of the excellent sequences in the film, which also work because they help drive the story along. Again, like a New Hope, sound work was first rate and Oscar winning. In most cases the sound has to be recorded in a studio and added many months after filming has been completed. Sound re-recordist Bill Varney would win another Oscar for Raiders of the Lost Ark. Steve Maslow and Gregg Landaker also worked as sound-recordists and are both prolific contributors to many high profile movies. They would also win Oscars for their work on Raiders and then some fourteen years later win again for their work on the Keanu Reeves hit movie Speed. Peter Sutton won for his on\u2013set work and has a large body of work in film since this movie. Also credit has to go the Ben Burtt's sound design work, which creates a fabulous sound-scape for the film.However, despite the above outstanding technical contributions, which serve to enhance and exciting and interesting story, it is composer John Williams who, yet again, takes this film to another level with another astounding musical score. Working with the director and producers, Williams develops and expands original themes. He creates a new and unforgettable theme for Darth Vader, with strong militaristic overtones, and clever themes for Leia and Han, and for Yoda. He weaves the score into the film expertly, giving moments of tension, excitement, thoughtfulness, mystery and tragedy with aplomb. The score feels more operatic than a New Hope, and helps cement this as one of the best adventure/fantasy films ever made.

We know that it's one of the probe droids Vader has sent to track him down. What happens on his journey to investigate? Is he confronted by Imperial Forces? Does he realize just in time? Actually he's knocked unconscious and taken captive by a horrifying Yeti-like predator to be savagely devoured. Immediately, the tone is set in stark opposition to the movie's predecessor. We're on Hoth, a planet blanketed entirely by snow and ice, routinely pummeled by countless meteorites from a neighboring asteroid belt, but the craters are fleeting as the planet is in a perpetual snow drift. The only native creatures to our knowledge are the tauntaun, camel-like creatures, and the Yeti-like ones. The latter eat the former. This is a clear indication of a film series that's going somewhere, not just playing variations on the same notes.And with confidence I say in my humble non-fanatic opinion that Empire is the best of the original trilogy. After the Buck Rodgers/Flash Gordon merriment of the original film, this one marches into mortality and sorrow, and rightly acquiesces to the latent conundrums of the story. It's because of the real drama propelled in Empire that the whole saga takes on a legendary value that hearkens back to the first and urges a continuation to the third. This is the core, not the Continuing Adventures Of. But that doesn't mean it's the most thought-provoking; it just means I buy it the most. It isn't introspectively involved or even very concerned with personalities apart from barefaced character attributes.As a result, we have the trite push-pull flirtations between Han and Leia, who begin to discover their fondness for each other during, among other things, while zooming through an asteroid field to evade Vader's goons. There is still forced, stilted dialogue aplenty, and there is also no development provided for Chewbacca, who was thrown into the first film as ornament, was never fully contemplated, and consequently was burdened with one facial expression and one bereft gargle/bark/roar. Much more could have been done. How can you be a space pilot and not be able to interact in any productive way? Does Han actually comprehend Chewy's uniform babble? Otherwise, how have they bonded? Yoda, however, is introduced with real flavor and feeling, as well as an Eastern-infused philosophical affectation. The seemingly unintentional hilarity of his voice and physicality don't seem like datedness but rather something audiences since 1980 have been too reverent or awe-struck to deride the way they do other '80s fantasy films. Who are funny are C-3P0 and R2-D2, mostly because they are essentially Woody Allen and Lassie as a comedy duo, in robotic form.But the heart of Empire is the extent of Darth Vader's ruthlessness, and his legendary obsessive struggle with Luke. Indeed, he's such a powerful and controlling presence in this film, using the Force to make lethal examples out of his own underlings as well as experimenting with putting people in chemical suspended animation freezing, that things do not go the way we'd like them to. The very bad news Luke hears, the way Han ends up paying back Jabba the Hut, the nature of Han's friendship with Lando Calrissian. There are real scenes of tension and suspense that arise out of the soap opera and mawkish comic relief. Nevertheless, the script is not only rooted in Lucas' story basis and the penning of future director Lawrence Kasdan but also one Leigh Brackett, who'd previously written some of the best Chandler adaptations as well as Rio Bravo. One can imagine the snarkiness of Han and Leia's dialogue and 3PO's hi-jinks delivering more becomingly in a film of the 1940s or '50s.Maybe since so much more deliberation and capital was concentrated on this fifth episode, the tipping point before the climax of a six-film saga, in the first place, not much was tampered with in the restored and sleek re-release. I never did recall the first film in precise detail, even when I saw this Special Edition in theaters in 1997, but now that my eye is more seasoned and conditioned, I can tell that the Cloud City was adorned with some supplementary enrichment, and there is more of that terrifying ice creature than before.

If not, one of the best films ever made. Simply because it does not try to be flashy, it is film-making done at it's finest.The film has been out since 1980 so if you haven't seen it then you have either being living under a rock, or in a galaxy far far away. Therefore I shall not discuss the plot too much.In short, the films picks up about a year after the first film. The Empire has recovered from the defeat it suffered at the end of 'A New Hope' and is back to crush the rebels. And they are succeeding, the rebels are forced back to the planet of Hoth as it is one of their last outposts. (*Not that it matters, but this entire battle scene is supposed to reflect the Battle of Stalingrad during the Second World War*). Having lost, the rebels split and so does the story. Han Solo and Princess Leia are forced to run from the Empire and attempt to escape whilst Luke must seek out Yoda, a mysterious Jedi master who will train Luke in the ways of the force.The bulk of the film is these two stories being played out next to each other.The two stories ultimately rejoin in Cloud City, on the planet of Bespin. Here, Han Solo and co. are captured by the Empire after being betrayed by Han's lifelong friend, Lando Calrissian. Lando claims that he had no choice into his betrayal as the Empire threatened his home world. Han Solo is frozen and taken away by Boba Fett (A bounty hunter). Luke meanwhile senses this and abruptly ends his training to go to his friends needs. And attempting to rescue them, Luke faces Vader for the first time. The result is one the most epic battles in movie history that is heavy on atmosphere and one that the audience knows Luke cannot win (after being told by Yoda). The fight finishes with Vader beating Luke, cutting off his right hand and delivers one of the most immortal lines in movie history: \"No Luke, I am your father\". Although I am sure that everyone knows of this line now, back when the films as released, it must have been such a dramatic twist. This entire scene in Cloud city is a true testament to how good film can be. The entire film is built up to this one scene and it delivers it so well.The Film then pieces together towards the end and results in Lando and Chewbacca going to look for Han Solo, and Luke comforting Leia.It goes without saying, but all the basics of film making are covered perfectly. The story never lets up on the always impending danger of the Empire. The Characters all change like normal human beings during the film and by this point in the franchise, we care deeply about them having seen what they are going through. The tension is built up to a dramatic peak and is delivered all at once.If I were to pick one problem in this film (and that wasn't easy) it would be that it provides too much of a problem for the characters to overcome in the final part of the trilogy. The results in too many problems being solved quite quickly in Return of the Jedi. The most obvious being the death of Boba Fett.Regardless, it acts at the perfect movie for the middle of the franchise with the characters facing their most difficult times and trying to find hope. This movie truly is a shining example of how films of all genres can be done extremely well.

George Lucas promised more and when The Empire Strikes Back was released in 1980, it was not just a film release, it was an event. Despite fears that a sequel would never be as good as the original and the film technically under-performance this is one of the few sequels that was better then the original.Despite the Rebel Alliance destroying the Death Star and the universe now safe from the ultimate weapon the Empire had gone on the offensive against the rebels, hounding them out of the bases. They are led by Darth Vader (David Prowse/James Earl Jones), the most fearsome commander for the Empire. On the ice planet Hoth, the Rebels have to fled when the Empire's forces attack. Within the Rebel camp Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamall) receives a message from Obi-Wan \"Ben\" Kenobi (Alec Guinness) from beyond the grave to go to the planet Dagobah and learn the ways of the Jedi from a powerful master Yoda (Frank Oz). His friends Hans Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and 3CPO (Anthony Daniels) have to escape Hoth and end up being chased by Darth Vader. They set out for safety to the Cloud City led by Hans' friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). Vader himself becomes obsessed about finding the Millennium Falcon, and Luke who becomes a major threat to the Empire.Lucas did the smartest thing he could with this sequel, he took more of a back sit. It is known that he is not the best screenwriter and director in the world, but is he a great producer and ideas man. He came up with the basic story idea and wrote some of the key scenes, but it was Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan who wrote most of the screenplay and Irvin Kershner was brought in to direct. This team made a brilliant sequel expanding on the ideas of the original ideas of the film, from the mystical powers of the Jedi to the multiple worlds and creatures that are created to how the Empire function, which was a cross between the Roman Empire and Nazi Germany. Brackett and Kasdan with Kershner's direction were able to interweave multiple story lines in a space set epic. Like the original the Empire Strikes Back was able to use many sci-fi ideas into the film, multiple alien races, psychic powers, grant designs of futuristic weapons and warfare and a setting crossing fighting a dictatorship and general lawlessness. Kershner was able to make a atmospheric film which a darker in tone, particularly in the third act. He shot some of the best action sequences in the whole series, like the battle of Hoth, and the fight between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader was not just an excellent fight but also brooding experience, filled with tension and is one of the best sequences in film history. As well as it being the best Star Wars film it is also Kershner best film by a long way. Despite the darker tone Kershner was still able to lighten the film enough and allow the audience to relax with some well timed humour.The characters are developed even further. Darth Vader is even more menacing then he was in the first film with a dark ambition and secret, making him one of the best screen villains ever. He oozes a dark charisma and he is as ruthless as Hitler, Stalin and Mao when it came to military command and tactics. The relationship between Leia and Hans Solo also improves, from hating each other to discovering their true feelings. Luke too grows from a competent commander to a man who has to discovery his destiny, but also prone to his emotions, when he needed to master them. Billy Dee Williams is an excellent addition to the series and his character represent a moral dualities that inflecting the world they live in.

Combining the epic story, iconic characters, and wonderful imagination of the original Star Wars trilogy with the masterful character driven direction of Irvin Kershner results in a breathtaking cinematic experience. It can be considered a masterpiece all on its own, and this is in large part to the superior storytelling techniques on display.Empire Builds on the excellent original film with improved dialog that is consistently witty, and the character development is superb. As with all Star Wars films, the special effects are impressive and provide new exciting worlds to explore. The screenplay deserves credit for giving meaning to the entire trilogy, especially the scenes with Yoda, which get surprisingly deep in the psychological sense. This may also be the finest score John Williams has ever composed among a career full of them. In fact, this is fittingly one of the greatest scores composed for a motion picture. Every scene is done perfectly, with memorable musical cues for every character, and gives us such iconic themes as \"The Imperial March\" and the poignant love theme that beautifully closes the film. There is not a scene in Empire that doesn't serve its purpose effectively. The screenplay is one of the very best, balancing so much character driven story with a thrilling plot and one of the best twist endings ever. Every major character benefits from a strong dramatic story arc. The film is also remarkably effective at achieving a perfect balance of action, humor, tension, and romance. Often times credited with being almost too dark when compared to the other installments, Empire actually stands out as the Star Wars movie with the most genuine wit and humor. It features lots of comic relief, provided by not only the side characters but also with the ever engaging banter between Han Solo and Princess Leia, which adds a level of believability to the romantic subplot. The scenes between Han and Leia are some of the best ever captured in a major blockbuster such as this. Harrison Ford completely cements Han Solo as one of the coolest movie characters of all time in this film.This episode makes the most out of being the middle act in the trilogy by jumping almost immediately into an exciting battle with the attack on Hoth, and also features plenty of other action, such as the asteroid field chase (both again benefiting from the excellent score). The action on cloud city also serves as being refreshingly suspenseful in its simplicity. And as good as the earlier scenes are, the light saber duel between Dath Vader, the greatest movie villain of all time, and Luke Skywalker is a masterpiece in character driven action. So much is going on between the lines in Empire it would be impossible to fully cover it. Suffice to say that there is more accomplished in these scenes emotionally than in anything seen in the entire prequel trilogy. The ending of the film is, again, beautifully done, with its cliffhanger nature feeling strangely resolved and poetic.The spectacle of incredible effects, characters, and story all comes together in one incredible package, and makes The Empire Strikes Back one of the finest achievements in film history.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "The greatest blockbuster of all time.", "date": "2010-04-05T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2231496", "sentiment score": [0.0046, 0.0112, 0.0215, 0.2453, 0.7173]}, {"content": "Yeah, if you're one of the like five people in the entire world who still hasn't bothered to watch the Star Wars Saga, then just do it, Right Now.

Now I have sat down to watch back-to-back both the theatrical and updated versions of the second movie, \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and my verdict is still unanimous on that one as well: this is one of the best science-fiction movies ever made and it still baffles me how critic John Simon could comprehend of saying that a movie this bold and imaginative and daring and thrilling is junk and is dehumanizing to the younger generation. It certainly isn't to me. And the reason why I primarily admire \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is not the fact that its special effects are first-class or that they are used with imagination, but that its dominated by a superb science-fiction story, memorable characters, smart dialogue, and a true foreboding and mysterious atmosphere totally alien to the cheerful opera-like personality of the first movie.\"The Empire Strikes Back\" take place after the destruction of the Death Star. The Galactic Empire's command is now mainly controlled by the tremendously fearsome Darth Vader, who is vigorously hunting young Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) who is one of the leaders of the Rebellion. After a battle with the Empire, Luke and his friends are separated. While Han Solo and the others try to dodge Vader's pursuit, Luke lands on a mysterious planet where a little creature named Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz) teaches him the ways of the Jedi.There is not a single weak element to \"The Empire Strikes Back.\" But I think so many people miss out on what makes the picture so enthralling and wonderful. Everybody mentions the special effects and yes they are revolutionary and spectacular, but the skill and persuasiveness of the special effects is just two dimensions of their success. The third and most powerful dimension is the fact that they are used with imagination. Special effects are just a package order in Hollywood. But using imagination behind them cannot be bought and paid for, it takes the genius that these filmmakers possess. And the special effects are used to create a world. Just for example, the ice world of Hoth where the beginning takes place. It's not just that we see a big icy world that looks like a frozen planet, but that we see creatures and ecosystems. This is a world. Not a set. The costumes used for Chewbacca and C-3PO and the comical R2-D2 are effective as the models for spaceships, but the most astonishing effect is Yoda, who is nothing more than an animatronic creature controlled and voiced by Frank Oz, who expresses every emotion that a human actor can through his face and eyes and this puppet Yoda has more emotion than the CGI one that was found in the prequel trilogy.But what I admire most about this picture is the dark, moody atmosphere, which is quite rare for a science-fiction picture. Typically, the atmosphere is cheery or lighthearted, as in the first movie, but \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is darker, most nihilistic, mysterious, and somber. It's a violent picture. Kills and betrayals are not felt as moves in a chess game. The characters are three-dimensional, especially Han Solo and Darth Vader, who before was just a strong supporting presence, but here has evolved into one of the screen's most chilling villains. Before he mostly just stood around and hissed through his voice machine, now he really dominates the screen and drops our jaws.Comparing the theatrical version to George Lucas's updated version, which includes an extended scene of the Yeti-like monster that attacks Luke early in the picture, both are equal in their majesty. Which is better? Hard to say, but it's close. So if a person came up to me and asked me \"which version should I see?\" I'd answer, \"take your pick.

But where Star Wars capitalized, Empire Strikes Back took it to the next level.Here's what I think of the movie: Story - I'm pretty sure we all know the story of Star Wars. A Galactic Empire is empowering the galaxy, and a Rebel Alliance tries to stop it. Today, it's sort of a clich\u00e9 plot but back then, it was imagination skyrocketing into the heavens. Now, thats the plot of Star Wars. The story spans from a battle on the frigid planet of Hoth, to a space dogfight in an asteroid field, to Cloud City where the greatest plot twist in the history of cinema, is reveled. The film ends on a cliffhanger which leads to Return of the Jedi. I'm not going to spoil it, but I don't think I would need to because I'm willing to bet that about 99.99% of people have already seen this movie anyway(to that .01%, where the hell have you been?).-Rating 10/10 Characters - The characters from the original movie are back, including Luke, Han, Leia, C3P0 and R2D2, and of course, Darth Vader. But the films also introduces some new characters as well, including Lando, The Emperor, Boba Fett, and Yoda. The Emperor doesn't really play a big part in the movie(I think he only has like, 10 lines) and Boba's name is never really mentioned. However, Yoda plays a big part by teaching Luke the ways of the force, and Lando, who is Han's old pal, plays a big part by betraying our heroes and giving them to Vader. Of course, he's still a good guy, he had to hand them over. Overall, I'd say the characters are still great.Rating 10/10 Visuals - This was back when Star Wars movies didn't rape the fabric of CGI. So what you see in the movie were real things. The Walkers, asteroids, X-Wings, Tie Fighters, everything. The original Star Wars set the standards for Special Effects with the light sabers, Death Stars blowing up and everything. Empire Strikes Back isn't any different. The Effects are still awesome and look great.-Rating 10/10Music - The Star Wars theme is (of course) still here and it's one of the most recognized themes in cinema. You only need to hear a second of the Star Wars theme, and you'll know what it is. Like any other Star Wars film, the music is composed by John Williams, so everything is played by an orchestra. Even though it's great the here the Star Wars theme in all it's nostalgic glory, the music thats played is still just as great.-Rating 10/10 Overall - Empire Strikes back is my favorite Star Wars film and is one of my favorite movies.

Of course, there was French Connection II, and Godfather II, but neither of them could quite compare to the original. Enter Empire Strikes Back. Not only did this sequel have a tougher job to live to its original counterpart (a box office phenomenon that would forever change marketing, merchandising, and film-making for generations to come), but this sequel quite frankly did the unthinkable by changing the tone, raising the stakes, and not promising a happy-go-lucky ending that usually associates with sequels. Empire Strikes Back is yet another Star Wars movie that broke the rules of how to make a film and also ushered a new style and technique of film-making.This movie didn't have the expected ending. Not all the backstories and main stories reached a resolution. The bad guys did win. The good guys were doomed.

Accompanying the change in pace is an excellent score, superb directing, incredible action, top-notch special effects, and basically the complete package in entertainment.

This sort of movie-making magic just can't be duplicated.Empire Strikes Back is about the travels of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Han Solo (Mark Hamill, Carrie Fischer, Harrison Ford) as they suddenly encounter a massive resistance coming from the Dark Side of the force. Led by an angrier and less sympathetic Darth Vader, the rebels are suddenly faster, swifter, and smarter in their attempt to control the universe. At the same time, Luke begins his training to become a Jedi knight, only to have his training stalled when the conflict is becoming increasingly dangerous to all his friends. While it is obvious George Lucas didn't have every detail planned out in the trilogy (Example: Leia/Luke/Han love triangle), he had a grand idea as to where the franchise was going story-wise.The strongest part of Empire Strikes Back is like that of the original: the special effects and the associating visual spectacles that transports you to a totally different universe. The film was larger-than-life, as every location is grander and more impressive than the last: beginning with Hoth (and its classic snow battle) and ending with Bespin. While this was Lucas' creation and story, we cannot forget the directing of Irvin Kershner, which was the best of the entire franchise. Thanks to him, the acting here was best, the surprises were best-hidden, and the pacing was at its peak. The two hours breeze by here, and is capped by one of the strongest finishes in any blockbuster movie.All of your regular characters were back and were at their most entertaining here: Han Solo is at his cockiest and funniest in the second installment, Luke Skywalker is at his most heroic (and most foolish), 3-CPO is at his funniest (and most irritating), and then Darth Vader is at his downright scariest. When Luke has to fight him, the only hint of sheer terror in the trilogy occurs then\u2014as Darth Vader pretty much tosses him around like an unwanted ragdoll. Adding to the fear is John Williams' immortal imperial march song, which makes its debut here. The rest of the music in this movie is also spectacular, and should have won the Oscar that year.Bottom Line: This is one of the top sequels of all-time, because it separates itself from the original by changing the tone, and expanding (and improving) upon everything that make the original Star Wars so great: the writing, special effects, directing, costumes, blend of action and comedy, set design, characters, musical score, pacing, and overall fun. Empire Strikes Back outperforms the original Star Wars in every aspect; from the better first act to even the smaller things like the lightsaber dueling choreography. It would be years before we find a blockbuster sequel that can top the original, and that's Terminator 2 which doesn't occur until the next decade.Like I've said about Star Wars, if you have not seen this movie, it's because you are trying so hard to avoid it. If you don't like this movie, then it's because you just don't enjoy good movie-making. Empire Strikes Back is one of those rare movies that can be wholesomely entertaining yet engrossingly deep at the same time.

But then, can they appreciate cinema as a whole? Casting this unsolicited attack aside, those who are not experts in the field and I would include myself as one, should start with star wars series. Star Wars IV a new hope was a very good start but the special effects and plot was not as refined. You could see the lack means as a first major project for George Lucas. But it is easily forgiven since Star wars V is the gem in the crown. I have to rate this film as a masterpiece, if not by its incredibly credible special effects (even by 2009 standards), but by a story which keeps the mystery till the end. The epic fighting and tight situations keep us on the edge of our seats throughout. It is fast paced. But I watch this film at least once every year. And every time I know I am going to watch it again. I know the story, I surely remember almost all the scenes of the movie. It is the atmosphere in which we are cast from the minute the small written resume rolls up the screen with the background music, that doesn't leave us. George Lucas, as confirmed Steven Spielberg is a master at story telling. He adds the spices to an already good sauce to make it sublime. Hans Solo is in the same vein as Indy in Indiana Jones, but we just never get tired of it. The two droids add an uncanny sense of humour; the unity of the whole rebel group; the love hate relationship of Hans Solo and Leia, all very simple ingredients mixed together by the genius of George Lucas, whether he did it purposely or not.

The comic relief is given at the right moment and isn't over done.Rather, this film puts all the characters through their own turmoil and emotional battles.

Therefore, it is especially difficult for me to review it.Most people on IMDb have seen this film and are therefore familiar with the story. Episode V is the darkest in the classic trilogy. I also mean this literally. But most important, this film focus more on Dart Vader, the ruler of the galaxy, than the other films. He is the dark knight slaughtering everyone who gets in his way.The pace is, like all Lucas films, very fast. That is a good thing. After all, there is no food for thought here. Even an eight year old will not miss any messages hidden between the lines.Casting has never been Lucas's strong side. Harrison Ford is the big exception here. He fits the role as the rough guy who ended up supporting the good side seemingly by chance. His temper, barefaced lines and selfishness prevents our heroes from appearing dull.Dart Vader is a symbiosis of David Prowse doing the physical acting and James Earl Jones speaking the lines. I wouldn't call the physical acting difficult, but David does his job. The latter person's deep voice is ideal for the dark knight.Alec Guiness appears just a couple of minutes in the film. As always his acting is flawless.The rest of the cast is a mixed bag. Mark Hamill looked like a good choice in episode IV when he was a rookie in the space war business. In episode V he just don't manage to depict the main character as a confident jedi knight.Carrie Fischer as Princess Leia and Billy Dee Williams as Lando act with no credibility. Jeremy Bulloch depicts the ultra cool bounty hunter Boba Fett nicely, but like Dart Vader it is not the hardest thing to do.How can I give the film 9 points after these harsh comments? This is sci-fi. Who expects deep meaning, memorable acting or complex drama? Most people are more interested in high production values. Episode V was by 1980 the best produced film ever. To make space ships, lasers, futuristic building structures and numerous creatures look natural is a challenge even today. Star Wars episode V is far beyond Alien, 2001, Star Trek, Close Encounters, etc.The film won an Academy Award for Best Sound. How does a space ship sound? You'll find the answer in this film.Last but not least, the sound track is great. Like a Wagner opera each character is given a theme. The effect is fascinating. John Williams won international acclaim with the score and it is the only classical sound track music album which went gold until decades later.

However I feel that The Empire Strikes Back is easily the greatest film of the series and one of the greatest films ever made.The rebels are forced to flee from the ice planet of Hoth after the Imperials discovered their hideout there. Solo, Leia, Chewbacca, and c 3P0 take off in the Millennium Falcon. Luke meanwhile travels to the Dagobah System to learn from the jedi master Yoda. Darth Vader then puts all his efforts into capturing the Millennium Falcon as to lure Skywalker to him. Vader then plans to turn Skywalker over to the dark side of the force.The main reason for this film being awesome is that there is so much going on. There really is no main setting and instead see various awesome settings. The ice planet hoth, swampy Dagobah system, asteroid field, cloud city of Bespin; it just is great how there are so many different places where action takes place in this film.The action in this film is legendary. Battle of Hoth is awesome and the imperial AT AT walkers are really a spectacle to behold. The asteroid field chase with the millennium falcon is also great. Also who can forget the legendary lightsaber duel at the end between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. I certainly never will forget that duel, to me that is the best moment in Star Wars history.This film does an awesome job developing characters. Solo and Leia develop a romantic relationship that I think fits the film well. Also the character of Chewbacca is portrayed more as a great companion and useful at helping out rather than just as a lumbering brute as he is in the first film. Luke starts to use the force more and develop into a jedi. Darth Vader also goes from being just an evil villain in the first film and becomes a legendary villain also capable of making outstanding strategies. Vader in this film is the greatest villain I have seen in a film and the way that he is portrayed in this film is awesome and the best portrayal of a villain in a film.New characters are added in this film. Lando Calrissen gets his first appearance. I do not really like or dislike Lando that much. Yoda make his first appearance in the Star Wars franchise. Who can not like Yoda? Yoda is easily one of the most powerful presences in a film and a master of the force. Frank Oz does an awesome job portraying Yoda. But to me the best new character in this film is Boba Fett. Fett is a great bounty hunter who will hunt down people in constant pursuit. Fett is my favorite Star Wars character and he adds to the films overall tone of suspense and unease in this film.The music is phenomenal in this film. This is the first film to use the Imperial March song and that film goes great with Darth Vader. When it is played at the same time as when Vader is on screen it is outstanding. Easily one of the best musical scores ever in a film, hats off to John Williams.

Technically, in story telling and in tone, it holds up well today and certainly warrants the amount of times it crops up in best sequels debates. That it's not actually a sequel is irrelevant, it is of course the filler in a wonderful sci-fi sandwich, because as second instalments go, Empire has few peers. With Empire Strikes Back we get all the whizz bang adventure strewn heart of Star Wars, but George Lucas (stepping aside for Irvin Kershner to direct) has also fleshed the story out with a serious dark tone that oddly becomes a bedfellow to the romantic fun on offer, where new and engaging characters (and creatures) add spice to this wonderful fantastical broth.Aided by the considerable writing talent of Leigh Brackett (The Long Goodbye, Rio Bravo, The Big Sleep), Lucas took the bold and ingenious step of giving the bad guys the upper hand, in fact it could be argued that he was taking a considerable risk with his ending. Forcing his viewers to wait for the final chapter (three years later), after tantalisingly setting us up with a corker of plot twist (one which is still to this day as potent as it was back on release), Lucas pulled perhaps one of the cheekiest carrot dangles in cinema history.Though more famed for its dark undertones, Empire is for sure still a very fun movie, C3PO goes into camp overdrive and Han Solo ups his quip quota by some margin. Then of course there is Yoda, in himself a comedic joy. The action sequences beg for repeat viewings, a battle on the ice laden planet Hoth is a marvel and the choreography for Skywalker's fight with Darth Vader is out of the top draw. But ultimately it's with the dark side that the picture excels.

Meanwhile, Luke seeks to learn the ways of the Force in preparation for his showdown with Darth Vader.The cast is mostly unchanged from the first film. The most notable new faces are Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) and Yoda (voiced by puppeteer Frank Oz). I'd venture to say that the acting is a little better than the first film, though that may be because the characters are a little more refined.The film contains the same sense of excitement as the first but there's also a darker side as Luke discovers the truth about his father's supposed demise. Then, of course, there's the cliff-hanger ending that leaves the viewer itching to move on to the final chapter.The direction, taken over by Irvin Kershner, is (in my opinion) a step up from the first film. No doubt the film's improved look was also bolstered by a more generous budget. The special effects were spectacular once again and landed a special achievement award at Oscar time. Of course, the effects aren't as polished as today's best efforts but they remain impressive.The score by John Williams is excellent; as good as (if not better than) his score for the first film. Also, the sound is top notch once again, resulting in the film's only Oscar win.All in all, the middle film in the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy makes a strong case as the single best film in the series.

When Lucas first proposed \"Star Wars\" the board at 20th Century Fox probably thought he was mad, especially since special effects were primitive at best. Who could have envisioned what he had in mind when he first made the original? Who could have imagined what a light saber was? As many have stated, this is much better than the original, and I wholeheartedly agree. After watching a film so many times, people become immune to the amazing innovations shown. A good example is \"Citizen Kane\" which included memorable imagery including \"deep focus\", low angle shots that showed ceilings, overlapping dialogue, and camera trickery. Many people see \"Kane\" for the first time and proclaim \"Big deal!\" In \"The Empire Strikes Back,\" some of original innovations are the Imperial Walkers, the ice planet of Hoth and the Zen-like Yoda who philosophizes with phrases like \"Try not. Do. Or Do not. There is no try.\" I won't re-hash the plot since everyone knows it by now, so I will review the intricacies that make this film work so well. I think the humor in this film works tremendously: for one, the interplay between Han Solo and C3PO cracks me up (\"Sir if I may venture an opinion--\" \"I'm not really interested in your opinions 3PO.\"). Another thing that works is another character not listed in the credits--the Millennium Falcon. The lovable \"piece of junk\" that is forever under repair but always comes through in the clutch, like when Han et al were trying to escape from Hoth. There was a pretty tense moment when the Falcon wouldn't start while the Empire's stormtroopers entered the docking bay (\"Would it help if I got out and pushed?\" \"It might!\"). And yet, the Falcon came through as always when the laser machine gun appeared. Further, the non-functioning light speed on the Falcon is a great sub-plot of the film.Darth Vader is at his very best (or worst?) in the way he kills off his own men who fail him. The scene when he kills off Admiral Ozzle is priceless not only for Vader's vengeance but for Admiral Piett's trying not to look at his dead former commander on the deck. Another great scene is Vader killing off Captain Needa (\"Apology accepted Captain Needa.\") I will even overlook the \"borrowing\" from \"Casablanca\": in that film, the Nazis first won't let Victor Lazlow leave Casablanca and then change their minds when they won't let him stay. In this film, Princess Leia was supposed to stay and then Vader \"altered\" the plans.Some of the greatest films are great in part to the score. How John Williams didn't win an Oscar is another infamous slight by the Academy (He did win a BAFTA). The \"Imperial March\" is such a sublime acievement, perfectly fitting for Darth Vader's gang.Lucas ventured into dangerous territory in trying to make a film better than the original \"Star Wars\", but he succeeded. Unfortunately, his luck ran out 22 years after the original \"Star Wars\" was released when he tried to recapture the glory--and money--when he made the infamous prequels.

In the original Star Wars, the first 25 minutes is boring. The same argument does not (indeed, can not) apply to The Empire Strikes Back. It starts on an exciting note, and the excitement never slows down. What's wrong then? The beginning is just too confusing! A while passed between the two films, and Luke's voice sounds somewhat different. So for about the first 10 minutes of the movie, (where no faces are shown, and only Han Solo's name was mentioned) I was wondering: \"Is it really him? Or was it someone else?\" Omitting that confusing first 10 minutes, this movie was, to be perfectly honest, amazing. The acting really improved, I think, from the original. I positively loved Billy Dee Williams (who should've played Two-Face in Batman III) in this movie. James Earl Jones, who delivered a fantastic performance in the original, was even better here. (Darth Vader's sardonic line \"Apology accepted\" was just amazingly delivered!) He was even scarier, I'd say. Harrison Ford's character was a little more developed, as was Carrie Fisher's. Mark Hamill did a great job, too.Of course, now we get to the list of annoying characters. C3PO really began to bug me in this movie, which he didn't do as much in the original Star Wars. I still found Chewbacca to be really irritating most of the time. R2D2's inability to communicate in anything other than beeps and whirs (that had to be interpreted by C3PO) got on my nerves really often. And, of course, before Yoda revealed who he was (although everyone knows by now how he looks like), he was the most annoying of the lot.What I loved about this movie was John Williams' music. He certainly went against my expectations. Instead of composing a sci-fi sounding score, with futuristic sounding instruments, he composed one \"traditionally\".

Like there were layers of detail that we didn't get and The Empire Strikes Back burst into those layers and put us deep into the world and the story never to turn back. On top of that the film delivers the first and most infamous twist in film history...family connections so to speak. I won't give it away if you have existed under a rock for the last three decades. The fights are epic, the new characters are amazing, and even Hamill as Skywalker starts to really shine and get some real depth to his character.I already reviewed the cast of the original film but their characters really do change a lot for the better in the sequel. Mark Hamill's performance matures and really comes full circle just like his character in the film. His naivety and boyish charm changes for the better as he trains to become a Jedi and an adult. Harrison Ford's Han Solo is probably the character that changes the least and probably just a case of \"don't mess with a good thing.\" Solo is still a kick butt hero and his story is a focal point of the sequel. Carrie Fisher slips back into her role as the feisty Princess flawlessly. This time the banter and romantic tension between Fisher and Ford heats up and really gives the story a timeless romance. Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker, and Peter Mayhew return in full form as C3P0, R2D2 and Chewbacca and they are better than ever. David Prowse with James Earl Jones providing the voice continues to make Darth Vader the most evil, intensely bad villain in the history of films. Vader's character really turns up the heat and gives a terrifying turn as the leader of the Empire. Billy Dee Williams is a newcomer to the cast and a welcome addition. He plays gambler, scoundrel Lando Calrissian. He doesn't get a lot of background or depth to his character and yet he is a great addition to the cast. And saving the best for last...the master of the Star Wars Universe. Frank Oz brings Master Yoda to life. The entire sequence with Luke and Yoda meeting for the first time and training is brilliant. Yoda is a timeless character, a pop culture phenomenon and yet his part in this is touching, funny, and brilliant. Pretty good for a puppet.The Empire Strikes Back is just simply non stop. The film picks up where the first left off and takes the viewer on a thrill ride that just never stops. This is ultimately all about the evil Empire and Vader getting his revenge and essentially succeeding. Starting from the opening moment of the film on the brilliantly crafted ice world of Hoth, and continuing on to a show down between Skywalker and Vader himself and the revealing of the infamous secret this film is just brilliant. The direction, the creation, the writing, the characters and the special effects are jaw droppingly amazing. There is simply no way you can watch just one Star Wars movie because the story is so important but after watching the first one and thinking...wow this is pretty incredible, The Empire Strikes Back will floor you!! One of the greatest sequels of all time. 10/10", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 4, "votes": 6}, "heading": "They do strike back and make the best sequel in film history", "date": "2009-02-16T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2024441", "sentiment score": [0.0096, 0.051, 0.1368, 0.6273, 0.1753]}, {"content": "The first time I got to set my eyes on this movie, back in 2000, was on an old TV record that we had somewhere here... I didn't know what to expect. The only thing that I'd ever seen of Star Wars was a vague memory of Yoda that was invoked by the word 'yoga' and I believe a poster of The Phantom Menace, so I didn't really know much about this franchise. So I placed the record into the VCR and started watching...and I was blown away.I watched the opening crawl before being introduced to my first Star Destroyers, and I must say...I found this introduction to be pretty interesting. The pacing, overall, was pretty good, especially for the start of a science-fiction film. (even though it's actually a space opera, but who cares...)So I got to see the main character getting into trouble with an ice monster that seemed to be looking for food, and found it..then shots of the other main characters who seemed to be worried about the main character, and were discussing some other business as well... After some of that business, we got to see a pretty large-scale ground battle which had some interesting stop-motion animation which deemed to be pretty effective for a movie of the early '80s, and at times looked rather advanced to execute. The special effects were great, overall, for a movie from around the time of Raiders of the Lost Ark.After a while, the main characters split up and meet differing situations, before eventually both facing peril, both eventually managing to get out of this, but then, near the end of the movie, all being trapped in the same location, just in very different spots.What I really liked about the film, however, was this sense of isolation. An ice planet almost devoid of life, a forest planet with barely anyone to talk to, a lonely cave...I feel that this had an interesting influence on the perception of the interaction between some of the characters.The Han/Leia romance was one thing that kind of interested me due to the characters being of totally opposite personalities and origins, and the R2-D2/C3PO conversations...Now the personality of Darth Vader in this film was also to my liking. He very plainly didn't care how many admirals and captains he killed...after he needed them no further, or felt they had failed him, he disposed of them like they were nothing. What made this a bit funny, however, was how nobody seemed to care much if one of these persons was killed. I guess that's what they were used to.Some characters return, some characters are new, and some characters have been disposed of. Grand Moff Tarkin couldn't hold Vader to his leash anymore, so Vader could do as he wanted to whomever he felt fit, and he held an iron hand within the division of the Empire that he controlled.This film also marks the first brief appearance of the personage named 'The Emperor' back then, who would later be replaced by a different actor who would play in a few more Star Wars movies. After finishing this TV record, I eventually got hold of Star Wars: The Phantom Menace and the Special Editions of the original trilogy on VHS. Some changes in these versions were crappy, some weren't that bad. However I don't get why some lines had to be replaced in the Special Editions and the later 2004 Special Editions.Otherwise the only big change in the 1997 Special Edition seemed to be a more fleshed-out scene of the ice monster somewhere near the beginning of the film.After watching the Special Edition Empire Strikes Back and the rest of the originals in that version for quite a few years, I kind of went silent on Star Wars...until the release of Revenge of the Sith, and then, after that, again.. Then in 2007 I got a box of the Original Trilogy for Christmas.. And the alterations in that box were a bit more than I could bear.They replaced the conversation between Darth Vader and the Emperor with the actor that acted as the Emperor in the later movies, which sounded pretty consistent to do, but the make-up and lighting of that version was screwed up, they changed the dialog for some reason.. The original Emperor's projection had a face that was kept in the dark, and the 2004 DVD version's face was partially kept in the light and leaning backwards. Also, colouring issues were present at certain times.Well...after that I got the soundtracks and then The Force Unleashed, somewhere during 2008. And then I found the original version of this movie on DVD, as well as STAR WARS and Return of the Jedi...and I decided to buy those versions, because I was tired of seeing an altered version of a classic that made it look as though it wasn't made in the '80s, when in fact it was. It would seem I prefer the unaltered version over any others, no matter how badly they try to soup it up.

This is one of the highest ranked films on the website; it's regarded as one of the greatest sequels of all time; it's on most lists entitled the 'greatest motions pictures' of the respective genre; it's a film nearly everyone likes - and yet it failed, for me, to do any of these things justice upon recently seeing it for the first time. Perhaps you had to be there; to see it on opening night at a time when there was no such thing as the Internet on which you could download and/or watch special teasers or trailers; at a time when the studio were not able to give you the first five minutes as an appetiser to get you to see it; at a time when the only manner in which you could discuss the up and coming franchise episodes were face-to-face and not on message boards. Although it's too bad it isn't more like that nowadays.Maybe it's futile criticising it now, but at the end of the day, it's still just a film. Perhaps you really did have to be there on opening night with no knowledge of what awaited you, preparing yourself to be propelled into a world of monsters, space travel and aliens as you left your brain at the door. But I do think most people rate the film based on childhood experiences more than the film itself \u0096 they don't ask themselves the question 'How good was the film?', they ask themselves 'How happy was I as a kid when I first saw this?'.For the record, I liked the previous episode. I thought it was good fun and relatively light-hearted with a sense of vision going for it throughout. You really believed Lucas had an idea and desperately wanted to follow through on his vision. This twinned with the scope of ideas to do with space travel and the structuring of space stations, look of attire and general mise-en-scene enforces the evidence Lucas loved an idea to the point it was an obsession, an obsession he let everyone else into and love in equal measure.Alas, Episode V entitled 'The Empire Strikes Back' from 1980 is actually quite silly and removes any feeling or excitement the prior episode may have instilled into one. Its overall idea is that the young and upcoming hero in Luke Skywalker (Hamill) is to go off and train to take his skills to the next level and become a Jedi whilst friends Han Solo (Ford) and co. are chased down by the evil forces led by Darth Vader (Prowse/Jones).'Fine' you think, this may well be more interesting now that the introductions and general establishment of good versus evil has been dealt with; there also seems to be a self discovery journey going on. But if anything, the film is less interesting than the first one, particularly after about an hour after which it transcends into a bunch of slightly interesting scenes set on space ships and odd jungle infested planets. Once all that has happened, Vader gets some hired guns to find the rebels and more stuff happens that just has you passively sit there and watch it all unfold.Maybe it's that I cannot just let myself go, but I had no problem with the 1st and 4th episodes in terms of narrative, which were actually quite interesting as this broad and quite epic setting was used to transfer good and evil across a galaxy. In this one, there doesn't feel like anything at stake. The film's protagonist Luke is safe and sound on a jungle planet with Yoda, being taught what he needs to know, so he's fine, whereas Solo and co. are hopping around trying to dodge the forces of evil and the problem is you never feel any connection to them. Why should you feel any towards an annoying, big, hairy creature; daft comic relief robots and an underdeveloped, expressionless and somewhat empty headed woman who goes by the name Leia (Fisher).But these things are the bigger picture. The film has all number of frustrations going on at spaced intervals. Of course, Solo and co. never get hit by any of the laser beams and they can hide in that meteor storm nice and easily but again, criticising it seems futile. One thing I noticed on several occasions was that everyone in the Millennium Falcon kept talking over each other, which also annoyed me and the heavy handed catalyst which pushes Luke off into his training with Yoda is a near death experience on ice planet Hoth, during which he nearly freezes to death amongst being eaten.Towards the end of the film, Luke will be having a showdown with Vader after which a famous line is uttered. All well and good but Luke doesn't go down into the bowels to fight Vader because it's the realistic choice, he goes down there because we want him to \u0096 we want him to fight and the story demands he put his new Jedi skills into practice so that all can see how much he's really learnt. This is after the film goes needlessly 'dark' for one scene involving the freezing/supposed death of a main character and no, the film is 'dark' for that one scene; not from the start and throughout, it's still that laser dodging, fast talking, monster eliminating 'fun' the prior film was. All in all, The Empire Strikes Back is underwhelming and viewing it now makes it seems quite silly more than anything.

This is all the more remarkable because it is the sequel to Star Wars: A New Hope, a classic in its own right.A while ago, I wrote a review for The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers in which I described that movie as suffering from a fault that is common in sequels, a flaw I labeled as \"the meandering middle.\" The Empire Strikes Back never suffers from this. I suspect the reason why is because of the sharp writing of Empire. Lawrence Kasdan (writer/director of another classic, Body Heat) had impressed George Lucas with a draft of Raiders of the Lost Ark and was thus brought on to complete a final draft after Leigh Brackett's death. Kasdan's work is most evident in the scenes on Dagobah between Yoda and Luke. In A New Hope, the script was plot-driven; Empire is character-driven and dark without ever being bleak.The story opens on the frozen planet of Hoth, where the rebels are hiding from Darth Vader and the Imperial Starfleet. When found, a skirmish ensues, but this is only the catapult into the main plot: Han and Leia's flee from Darth Vader; Luke's training under Yoda; and the eventual union of these two stories.Irvin Kershner's direction is more ambiguous than Lucas'. Gone is the \"aw, shucks\" attitude of Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher is given a strong, mature role this time in place of her previously brash Leia. To Lucas' credit, this feels as much like the evolution of the characters as it does like improved writing and direction.One special note I want to make is John Williams' score. While it is arguable that the whole trilogy is the greatest scored film or film series ever, it is in Empire that Williams perfects that sublime and terrifying leitmotif for Darth Vader. While the main score of A New Hope was the one that won the Oscar, it is \"The Imperial March\" that is more widely-recognized today.All told, The Empire Strikes Back is more than just a worthy follow-up to A New Hope. It surpasses it, building greatly on theme by adding a truly creepy underpinning of emotion and enlightening us to the chilling person of Darth Vader. It is easily one of the best films ever made.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Maybe Obi-wan didn't tell Luke because there was a gag order on the results of the paternity test", "date": "2008-11-22T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1979116", "sentiment score": [0.0031, 0.0092, 0.0354, 0.4132, 0.5391]}, {"content": "No matter what you think 'defines' \"Star Wars\"- the action sequences, the detailed and enthralling mythos, the memorable characters, the romance, or just the atmosphere of adventure, \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is in just about every way the most rewarding viewing experience out of any of the six live action \"Star Wars\" films (I have not seen \"Clone Wars\" and don't intend to right now). Why? Because it pulls off what \"Revenge of the Sith\" failed at: creating a compelling and well-written character-driven story while still delivering plenty of action, humor, and remaining an homage to the serials of the 1930's and 40's. It's surprising that there remains debate over how right or wrong critics were on the film at the time of its release, when it received not negative nor very positive reviews, but mixed ones leaning towards the positive side, generally. Few critics initially recognized the superiority of this screenplay to the first film in the series, and not only its relative complexity but its richness in its allusions to and utilization of literature and films of the past to create its own unique mythos. It's hardly surprising, given that Leigh Brackett was involved in writing the screenplay, some of her greatest achievements in her film career being \"The Big Sleep\", \"The Long Goodbye\", and \"Rio Bravo\", all rich, detailed, and intelligent screenplays. Yes, attempting to argue that \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is an intelligent character-based film is fast becoming pointless; you're either preaching to the choir or attempting to convince those with the prequels fresh in their mind that \"Star Wars\" was, once upon a time, a franchise worthy of real praise. \"The Empire Strikes Back\" really does tell a compelling story, however, and it is compelling mostly because we really do care about Luke's journey, we do care about Han Solo, we love Chewie, we adore the banter between R2-D2 and C-3PO, and arguably most of all because Darth Vader isn't just a 'cool' villain, he's a genuinely interesting and compelling character (er, if you can keep Hayden Christensen out of mind). Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett have achieved something rare and special here, a grand Hollywood spectacle which can be analyzed and discussed at great length (which I'm definitely not going to do, if you're interested pick up one of the dozens, hundreds possibly, of books written on the subject, or just do a quick Google search) . It's a great screenplay. Not that there haven't been great screenplays let down by incompetent film-making in the past, but \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is certainly not an example of this. I'm sure \"Star Wars\" fans know much more about the making of this film and how much credit Irvin Kershner deserves for the end result than I do, but for this review I'll credit him with the quality of this film on a technical level. It's an improvement over the first film in many ways, as far as I'm concerned, especially the set design (which is more ambitious here), and the quality of the visuals and even the acting. \"Star Wars\" may have an opening scene and shot which remains magical to this day, but I'd argue that most of this film is memorable and enthralling, with only one or two scenes in the first half hour or so being just 'good'. The acting also improves notably, with the exception of Carrie Fisher (who really just isn't a good actor), Mark Hamill is arguably the most improved since the first film, really coming into his own as Luke Skywalker here, and even giving us one of cinema's few good 'NOOO!!!' moments. \"The Empire Strikes Back\" also introduces us to Yoda, of course, and I'm really surprised at how animated and expressive Yoda is (being, I'm pretty sure, a puppet at this point). The special effects in general are outstanding, outside of a couple of the creatures near the beginning of the film. It's not just that \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is an enthralling and exciting film, and an iconic one at that, but it really does work on a deeper level. No, I'm not saying that \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is some sort of immeasurably complex and subtle film, but what's impressive about it is that it offers spectacle and humor, but is also a genuinely compelling tale driven by its characters, primarily Luke. It's a great, great movie, and where \"Star Wars\" may fall just short of deserving the sort of praise it gets, \"The Empire Strikes Back\" really is a terrific movie and deserves all the praise it has received and will receive in the future. 9.5/10", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "The best of the \"Star Wars\" films", "date": "2008-11-06T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1971615", "sentiment score": [0.0169, 0.1505, 0.3742, 0.4086, 0.0498]}, {"content": "The Empire Strikes Back is the first sequel to Star Wars (1977), a thrilling and lively action/adventure movie, but Empire is actually a different kind of movie. It's darker, more thoughtful and slower. There's less action.At the end of the first one, which is confusingly called Episode IV, Luke had joined the rebellion against the evil Galactic Empire and had destroyed its most powerful weapon, the Death Star. With Empire (aka Episode V), the imperial forces pursue the rebels through space, and Luke travels to a swampy world to learn from a Jedi master named Yoda. He receives visions from the future that his friends will get into trouble, and leaves his training, against the advice of Yoda and the ghost of Obi Wan, to rescue them. Luke confronts Darth Vader, who informs him that he is Luke's father.For a movie about a war, this is pretty low on violence, with little action happening between the fight on the ice world and the climax where Luke faces Vader. That's because The Empire Strikes Back tries to be a different kind of movie. It is not so much light entertainment. It instead features thoughts on the Force, in scenes where Yoda instructs Luke, which basically means a discussion of the nature of good and evil. Evil is strong and tempting, and anger leads to it; but goodness is stronger. The Empire Strikes Back is thus a heavier work, though it's not exactly high art. Still, one should not get the wrong impression from the AFI lists counting Episode IV but not Episode V as one of the 100 greatest American movies. Episode V is as good (or better!)- much of it, including Yoda who is not in Episode IV, is iconic. By the way, Yoda is, from a special effects point of view, passable puppetry.What else can be said about this movie that hasn't already been said?

He no longer sounds like an idiot every time he opens his mouth. Last but far from least, even Vader, the enigma, becomes more complicated in this film. The character development is really what makes this film considered the best of the entire saga by many, many fans.

Most of the time it can end up as just a bridge with no ability to stand on its own, but it stands on its own. It borrows just enough from \"Hope\" and sets things in motion just enough that it does its job as a transitioning film, but the climax is kind of thrilling in its own way, not just as in we can't wait to see what happens next.

One lands not far from Luke and he sets off to investigate but before he can get far he is attacked by a yeti-like creature which drags him off to an ice cave. Luke manages to escape but it is too late for him to get back to the base and it looks like he might freeze to death. Luckily for him Han is out searching for him and eventually finds him just after he has a vision of his old friend Obi-Wan Kenobi who tells him to seek a Jedi master called Yoda on the planet Dagobah. Once back at the base the soon learn that the Empire has discovered where they are and start to evacuate. While this is occurring they must hold off an attack by imperial walkers which are attempting to destroy the shield protecting the base. Eventually the base falls but not before our heroes can escape.At this point the action splits, Luke and R2 fly to Dagobah and Han, Chewie, Princess Leah and C3PO flee in the Millennium Falcon. When Luke arrives on Dagobah he discovers the planet is one huge swamp into which his X-wing sinks. He and R2 soon find a strange creature who says that he can take them to Yoda, of course it turns out that he is Yoda, after some persuasion he begins to train Luke.

Here they are met by Han's old friend Lando Calrissian who offers to help them. Unfortunately for them Darth Vader got there sooner and made a deal with Lando. Meanwhile Luke has a vision that his friends are in danger and ends his training early to go and help, despite Yoda's warning that he is at risk from the dark side of the force and could make things worse. When he gets there he confronts Vader who tells him something that goes against everything he thought to be true... in the very unlikely event that you don't know already I'll avoid spoiling it.Like the original film this is full of excellent special effects but isn't swamped with excessive CGI like the more recent prequels.

Mark Hamil is superior in comparison to his role in Episode IV, as well as Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford. James Earl Jones is the epitome of evil as Darth Vader, and makes him one of the scariest villains ever portrayed in film -- besting his role in the previous installment. Billy Dee Williams is great as Lando Calrissian, a suave and more swashbuckling character than Hans Solo at times -- in appearance and attitude at least.George Lucas' story is executed so well, both screenplay and direction, it surpasses A New Hope in every aspect. Taking us to new worlds, and giving us new characters that we either love, hate, or simply do not trust. The twist near the end (as everyone should know by now) is one of the best scenes ever put in a motion picture, and one of the greatest lines ever conceived. This is a darker Star Wars than A New Hope, which was more kid-friendly, however this is more for adults. The tone of the film is slightly grimmer, and the stakes are higher.

Like all great sequels, it doesn't try to be too much like its original. This film has a completely different feel to it, and it proves to be far more dramatic and intense than the last film.

Yoda. Cloud City. That moment when you realize family really does matter \u0085 priceless.Individually these words represent small facets of pop culture, making whatever the question is in Trivial Pursuit obviously \"Star Wars\", but when you put them together, in this order, the words \"Empire Strikes Back\" will inevitably fall from your mouth. The second chapter (or fifth, however you count them) in Lucas' grandiose space opera involves a frozen planet, a little green man, the force, family, and eventually a good old fashioned hand losing. (Should I have put Billy Dee Williams somewhere in there?) A personal favorite among the original three, I grapple with words because what can be said about this film that hasn't already been said dozens, even hundreds of times. This is a staple to my youth, a film series that I have seen over and over in no particular order. For this viewing, I went with the classic Laserdisc edition which reminded me that no amount of special effect could change the heart of the story. What can be said? What should be said? In Skywalker's famous words to Yoda, \"I can give it a try\" \u0096 we all know, by heart, what will follow next.\"The Empire Strikes Back\" is the strongest chapter in the original trilogy for three reasons. The first is that we have three subsequent chapters, each dealing with a different world, in a different galaxy far, far away. Lucas, in my eyes, has expanded his opera into more than just a desert planet, or a wooded terrain, or on a star that causes death; he grew and blossomed with this film. As audience members, we believe in each of the settings, we understand how cold it is on Hoth, we can feel the moisture on Degoba planet, and our fear of heights is prevalent in Cloud City. Lucas defines, travels, and leaves out no detail as he escapes with us through this expanding universe. Moving onto a second note, this is a darker chapter. Without repeating what so many others have said before, Lucas challenges us to escape from scene after scene of battle (albeit he does put a small dusting in) and listen to the words that his characters are telling us. He places small Easter eggs throughout that still gives us goose bumps as we watch (and understand), he hints towards the final chapter, but without really giving us the entire sandwich, just a sample. This smattering of the unknown, the final scenes where Vader reveals his journal's secret to Luke, the iconic nature of the slicing of the hand, all of this matches against any battle scene any science fiction director could create. Lucas has always been criticized for his lack of character development in his six-part series, and with Jar-Jar I can understand, but he had hit his stride with what he wanted from his leads. I could see the spark between Leia and Han, the love between Chewie and C3PO, and Yoda's Oz like abilities when he explains to Luke that the force lives in nature. Lucas is telling us, giving us the chance to see that the final battle will be a line up between Nature and Machine \u0085 get ready Ewoks. Finally, this film is the strongest because it is a victorious battle for the dark side of the force. Very rarely do movie audiences walk out of a theater and feel as if hope has been crushed on the curb. Each time I view this film, I get this child-like sensation that maybe, just maybe, Vader and the Emperor will crush this little Rebel Alliance in the final chapter and reign supreme forever. \"Empire Strikes Back\" gives you that sense of possible dark side victory, with the call of the bounty hunters, the frozen carbonate, and the loss of Skywalker's ambidextrous abilities. Think of it this way, was the Dark Side really that evil, or did they just wear black and pursue those that were unwilling to follow the law? Goth British police officers?In all honesty, \"Empire Strikes Back\" could be re-watched at this moment. There are less big fight sequences than in \"Return of the Jedi\", and there are less moments of confusion and droid humor, \"Empire\" stands on its own because it remains an elusive, dark chapter. Our leads, those that we have given our hopes, hearts, and dreams to, have all been fooled, tricked, or captured, and it feels confined (like it is only the Millennium Falcon vs. an entire armada of Star Destroyers) in this middle chapter. You leave the theater wondering about that infamous \"Who shot J.R.?\" moment, and a desire to see the Force be victorious. To me, this middle chapter gave the Dark Side of the Force an equal opportunity to make a case for itself; \"Star Wars\" is an equal opportunity employer.Obviously, I loved this film. It has been a staple, like so many others, in my youth for years and further into my adulthood. I love these characters, these worlds, the unknown, and especially Lucas' vision. Despite the criticism of the \"new\" chapters, we will always have the original to go back to in any shape or form. Without sounding repetitive, watch this series.

But compared to its sequels, it is the one that has gained the most from CGI.German fans, unfortunately, have to put up with the rather destructive efforts of re-dubbing Darth Vaders voice in two little scenes with seven dialog lines: his conversation with the emperor and another scene at the end of the movie. The original German voice, Heinz Petruo, had unfortunately died in 2001. But even so, all that needed to be added was one sentence: Vader: \"How is that possible?\" The studio didn't use its sophisticated mix-mastering equipment to rework the original tapes, move the other six sentences around a little and get a guy that, with a few audio filters, sounded roughly like the original voice to speak those four words. They did a completely new dub. It proves the engineer knew how to apply filters, but the voice acting is best described as talentless, and the manager who hired him should only do commercials.Now, Mr. Lucas, which number was I supposed to call if I'm not satisfied with sound quality?On the other hand, I think he deserves more praise than he got (at least from me) for his efforts to preserve the magic of the trilogy. I recently had the rare opportunity to watch a \"genuine\" Laserdisk edition of the original movie. It's closer to the real cinema experience because there is no PAL speedup, which produces a slightly slower pacing and darker voices (something NTSC viewers are not aware of). But even with the lower image resolution, it had noticeably aged. The stop motion animation looks jerky, the spaceships too static, color mismatch and compositing lines jump into view, things we never noticed - because they could not be done better at the time. All these things were fixed in the Special Edition. So without the remarkable devotion of mastermind George Lucas, the first three Star Wars films in their original form would be slightly dusty \"classics\" today, like Flash Gordon or the Frankenstein films, with special effects that look occasionally funny.George Lucas kept the trilogy alive for a new generation. Still, the originals preserve movie history. They breathe the flavor of the 70s and 80s in their sound effects and interior designs, and their inferior technical quality serves to draw attention to atmosphere, acting and story - at least for me, it was never mere fascination with special effects.

However, within this one it's the culmination of both fortuitous events and the craft and skill of everyone involved that makes this the best film of all time.If you start with the script, because many people leave this detail out, you realise how well crafted the dialogue is. This is no accident and arguably the key to this success was the work by Leigh Brackett, the woman that was also partly responsible for the script to the Bogey classic \"The Big Sleep\". I've often said that it you place Han and Leia's script in empire and compare the sparkling repartee between them and Marlow and Rutledge you could almost switch them between films (Those are harsh words to throw at a man, especially when he's walking out of your bedroom and sorry sweetheart, I haven't time for anything else, in particular).Then of course the luck factor kicks in. Bad luck at first with Mark Hamill's terrible bike accident which had to be explained with the wampa attack, which in turn leads to the scene where we see how Luke's powers are first coming along. Then arguably the best piece of lateral thinking. The obvious jedi master would be 6 feet tall and virtually indestructible, and rather than do that, they make Yoda anything but, they went the other way and created one of cinema's best realised fake characters. In Empire, Yoda is masterfully done and every scene with him is like a moment with a treasured Grandparent whose wisdom is strange but unquestionable. This is Yoda's film and is fantastic for it.The John williams score in this one is breathtaking, key moments, include the lifting of the X-wing and the confrontation between Lando and vader, so subtle, but so perfect.Finally the effects, the light sabre duel is arguably the best one ever put on film, as Luke's quick but not perfect yet, going up against a Jedi Warrior whose powers are second to only 2 others in the galaxy.

Frustrated, the rebels must bug out. Commander Luke Skywalker and his flight team make their stand against giant AT-AT Walkers and Imperial Snow Stormtroopers. Meanwhile, Leia cannot get to her transport, so Han Solo must get her out on the Millennium Falcon. Darth Vader is obsessed with finding Skywalker so he wants the Falcon. He will stop at nothing--even asteroids. Vader tracks them to Bespin where Han hopes an old friend, Lando can help out. However, Vader beat them there and force Lando to turn them over. Luke ventures to Dagobah to meet Yoda, the Jedi Master. There he undergoes training to be a Jedi. As he learns to focus the Force, he has a vision of Han and Leia suffering in a city in the clouds. He leaves training prematurely to face Vader. He is not ready. And he learns of Vader's secret. Star Wars was an introduction and The Empire Strikes Back goes deeper. At the outset, we learn more about the Force and how it can help. It was only vaguely touched on in the first one. We also learn more of Vader's sinister side. In the first one, his presence and appearance exuded evil. In this one, he demonstrates it through dispatching the Empire officers who fail him. We also get to see Leia and Han grow closer. Their love blossoms and grows. They had real chemistry. Finally, Luke really grows. He is the impatient, naive, and adventurous boy. He suffers for his decision. This forces him to mature. While some people found Chewabaca's incessant howling over the fate of Han Solo, I found it touching, giving the great side-kick alien depth and soul. The magic of Star Wars is unmeasurable. It was great swashbuckling fun with age old themes of good triumphing over evil. It allowed us to escape and be struck with wonder and awe. Empire, though, is thoughtful, deep, analytical, and fun. The audience will identify with Luke, Han, Leia and Chewie all the more because of their suffering. At this point, they were no longer larger than life, but human. I compare this to falling in love. With Star Wars, the infatuation and lust begins. With Empire, the love deepens and becomes solid. If it never happened, the love would not mature. This is Lucas truly at his best.

Many people want to give up searching for him. Meanwhile, Luke gets kidnapped by the 1980's version of an alien Abominable Snowman. After escaping the monster and killing it (I think), Luke goes out into the blizzard and sees Obi-Wan's spirit in the distance, telling him to go to Yoda on the planet Dagobah, and continue training. Han Solo finds him, about to freeze to death, and rescues him. Back at the base, they treat him and he makes a full recovery. Later on in the movie, the evil guys come to the planet and attack using those AT-AT walkers. The big battle begins and of course, the good guys win. What did you expect? On Dagobah, a little green man meets with Luke and R2D2. He is revealed to be Yoda. What I find cool is that Frank Oz has done the voice of Yoda for all of the Star Wars movies. You can tell that it's him in the Return of the Jedi because when he says \"When 900 years old you reach, looking good you will not be\" he sounds like Fozzie from the Muppets. Luke starts his training.Skipping a bit, the gang meets Lando Calrissian, the former owner of the Millennium Falcon. They all try to evade the Empire, but they realized that they've been tricked by Lando, who says that he had to join the bad guys to keep them from invading the city they're in. Luke is lured by his friends to the Empire and Darth Vader.Getting close to the intense part of the movie, they take Luke, Leia, and Han to a new place. Han gets frozen in carbonite. You'll see him like this in the next movie. When everyone leaves except for Luke and Darth Vader, the battle of all battles commences.As their fight ensues, they reach an area where if you fall, that is almost certainly your doom. Darth traps Luke and chops his lightsaber along with his right arm and they both fall down. Luke tells Darth that he killed his father.And then, the big twist............ are you ready? Here it is. After Luke says that here is what Darth says:\"No, Luke. I am your father.\" In my opinion, best twist they made back then. Naturally, Luke denies this. Darth offers Luke to join the Dark Side, but instead, like any crazy fool, he jumps. He calls to Leia, using the Force (foreshadowing? Maybe...) and he gets rescued. They look for Han, and the movie ends.How was that? Make your pick on which of the original ones was the best. I don't care, really. George Lucas is awesome. The movies are awesome.

The only movie I remember that can be compared to this achievement, and particularly in the \"classic special effects era\" (before 1983) is Ridley's Scott's \"Blade Runner\". Think about that.\"Empire\" has changed a lot of things in the fantastic genre. The very subtle psychology of such characters like Darth Vader or Han Solo was a whole new intention in the B-movies in 1980, and has been imitated a lot since then, until \"Pirates of the Caribbean 2\" last year. Think about that, too.On a personal point of view, I think \"Empire\" is a totally mastered work, a work that suffered, but that acquired a true soul.

The first \"Star Wars\" is, like what Shakespeare would say, such a palpable hit, that making a sequel will indeed be a big challenge, even for a man who has it all, George Lucas. Yet, Lucas succeeded. \"Empire Strikes Back\" is better than the first film, and that's a great achievement enough. Making a sequel to one of the hardest things, perhaps, even to the most prolific or talented of directors. \"Empire Strikes Back\" rivals and precedes it's predecessor by throwing in a lot of visuals. But stunning visuals that outdo everything in the original isn't just what the public demands. By the time EMPIRE STRIKES BACK hit screens, STAR WARS has already caught with the public. Everyone knows who these characters are. Now, all that's left there is to know who they really are. If STAR WARS is the introduction, EMPIRE is what George Lucas must have really had in mind. Lucas was wise to pass the directorial reigns to Irvin Kershner, a director who knows how to direct, and use his imagination thru filming. I've seen Kershner's other films, and I must say, they're all evident in \"Empire\". The plot this time centers more deeply on an every-growing political conflict. The Republic forces, hiding from a temporarily retreating Galactic Empire, are planning there next attempt on the Imperial forces. Led of course by Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), the forces are settling on a secret base on an uncharted planet. The evil Darth Vader (Dave Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) bares a grudge on young Skywalker (after events in the first film), and vows vengeance. After a sudden attack by Imperial Forces at the Rebel base (a visual-effects spectacle), young Luke must follow his very destiny. Now, this is where the real events in the \"Star Wars\" series really turns. At this point, Lucas has earned his place in Hollywood for his terrific storytelling talents.I wouldn't dream to tell the entire story, for I'm not that kind of film reviewer. But I'm pretty sure, you've seen this by now. Be that any version, you definitely have. Lucas has issued enough DVD or video versions of this film to make you see it. Remembering watching \"The Empire Strikes Back\" and the other \"Star Wars\" films when I was a kid is a key to actually enjoying them now. These kind of films are just plain terrific spectacles. One, that Hollywood movies today should be. Pure spectacle in special-effects and visuals and also in plot and story. How many blockbusters are still made this way? THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is probably the best STAR WARS there is. Riveting, exciting, fun but what deeply surprises is the depth and storytelling.

In The Empire Strikes Back, George Lucas allows his story outline to be scripted and directed by other hands (Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan on the screenplay, Irvin Kershner on directorial duties). It is a triumphant science fiction epic, a film of great invention and excitement, with remarkable set pieces and tremendous special effects. The film has a darker quality than its predecessor which lends a more complex and mature feel to the proceedings. It also manages the near-impossible job of being a thoroughly satisfying \"transitory\" movie \u0096 you have to remember that this movie doesn't have a start in the normal sense of the word since it continues a story already begun in an earlier film, nor does it have an end as such because much of the plot is left unresolved in preparation for the next movie.The heroes from the first film \u0096 Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) \u0096 are continuing their struggle to free the galaxy from the control of the Empire. All those loyal to the Rebel Alliance are hiding out alongside them on an icy planet named Hoth. After a galaxy-wide search the Empire, under the rule of Darth Vader (David Prowse, with the voice of James Earl Jones), finally discovers the true whereabouts of their Rebel enemies. A massive evacuation is mounted by the Rebels as the forces of the Empire lay siege to Hoth in an effort to destroy them. After the battle Luke separates from the others and goes to the Dagobar System, where he hopes to become a Jedi under the tutelage of wise Jedi Master, Yoda (voice of Frank Oz). Meanwhile, Han Solo spends most of the film trying to outrun the Empire's star fleet aboard his spaceship the Millennium Falcon. He decides to drop in on his old buddy Lando Calrisian (Billy Dee Williams) for help, but upon arriving at Lando's city in the clouds there is a nasty surprise in store\u0085..The Empire Strikes Back is really exhilarating stuff. It moves along two fronts, cutting from Luke's adventures and Jedi training to the thrilling chase sequence involving Han Solo. Both sections are brilliantly handled, with plenty to keep the audience engrossed. The performances in the Star Wars movies have never been the centre of attention, but there's much to enjoy in this one in terms of acting \u0096 Hamill's Luke Skywalker has evolved from the simplistic hero of the earlier film into someone more ambitious and tormented.

Released in 1980, it continued the story and contained what was, at the time, the most shocking moment in cinema history in the revelation of Luke Skywalker's parentage.Lucas' use of pairs of things continues to be strong motif. Luke is sent to Dagobah to train one-on-one with Yoda, hearkening back to the master-apprentice relationships of the glory days of the Republic. These scenes contain some of the best dialog in the series as Yoda explains the nature of life and the Force: \"We are luminous beings, not this crude matter.\" One of my favorite moments in the entire series also occurs, as Luke beheads the apparition of Darth Vader whose mask disappears to reveal Luke's own face, foreshadowing the twist to come. After Luke abandons his training to save his friends, it is revealed by Yoda that there is in fact another who can save them (ie not one but two).Technology is once again presented as potentially dangerous and above all fallible. The Millennium Falcon is constantly in a state of disrepair and never seems to work properly at the most critical times: a classic motif of science-fiction. Technology is also demonized by the shadowy presence of Boba Fett and especially by the only semi-human Darth Vader.The climactic moment of this movie occurs in Cloud City, as Luke and Vader duel in a hellish chamber of smoke and red lights. Vader severs Luke's right hand (as his had been previously by Count Dooku) and reveals that he is Luke's father. Luke chooses to fall to his death rather than live with this truth but he is saved by deus ex machina. The omnipresent malevolence of technology rears its head thereafter, as Luke's hand is replaced with a mechanical one, making him just slightly more like his father and nemesis and leaving the viewer in doubt as to how the story will conclude.Criminally ignored in its time by the Academy, The Empire Strikes Back is likely the greatest film of the genre ever made and sets the stage for the conclusion of the greatest series of all time.10/10", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 4}, "heading": "Part five of a great fantasy series", "date": "2007-08-30T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1721550", "sentiment score": [0.0035, 0.0118, 0.0569, 0.492, 0.4358]}, {"content": "are you kidding : one word : perfect . the Empire Strikes Back did just that when it came out :) Harrison Ford was at his best , Carrie Fisher never look more beautiful , Anthony McDaniels was funny , R2D2 was great and as well as Chewbecca , Mark Hamill was perfect as Luke Skywalker ; too bad for the original cast it had to end so soon .

The 2nd Star Wars film takes the original cast and subjects them to 2 hours of major discomfort...A forbidding icy planet replete with nasty creatures. There are ugly bounty hunters, monsters hiding out in the depths of asteroid fields, and Luke's foray into the black swamp of the Degobah system. It's a more taut, curiously downbeat film that slows almost to a halt in places, as Luke meets the Jedi Master who will teach him the ways of the force. The set pieces more than make up for the lack of pace...The opening battle on the Ice planet is a visually effective affair, and the stormtroopers have never looked as cool when they don their winter outfits. The asteroid chase and cloud city sequence are visual treats, that take you into the mysterious heart of the Star Wars Universe. The character development glues everything together. Luke's maturing process in the darkness of Degobah..Han and Leia's romantic chemistry, the droids comic relief and interplay with Chewbacca solidifies the group together and establishes a team spirit that was coming together at the end of Episode IV. The centrepiece of the film is the epic showdown between Luke and Vader,with that massive revelation, which inevitably ranks as one of Cinema's all time memorable moments. And it's a great sequence, from Vader's sobering welcome 'The force is with you young Skywalker, but you are not a Jedi yet' to the almost surreal climax. The forces of darkness loom large at every turn of the film...you get the feeling that the rebels are just slightly out of their depth. There is an underlying menace at work that heightens the dramatic tension..Vader is never as beautifully evil as he is in Empire. We finally see just why he is (Emperor aside) the top dog in the galaxy, as he lays waste to his own generals in ruthless fashion. We get some great new characters...Han's old buddy Lando Calrissien (sp?) is the slimy administrator of cloud city, who finds himself in a no-win situation, and there's the legendary Boba Fett..bounty hunter with balls of steel, and an outfit so cool it instantly establishes him as a Star Wars icon. And of course, the emperor rears his ugly head, and we get a taster of his malevolance. Any faults? It's hard to find much complaint. Some of the dialogue strays into cheeseland, the pace is interrupted with the curious but necessary Degobah scenes, but all in all, the sum of the parts adds up to a supremely effective, tightly woven sci-fi drama, the most deliciously dark of all Star Wars movies, and the most mature. Classic entertainment, stuck in a time capsule of its own, with enough memorable moments to ensure its place in the higher echelons of cinema history.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 7, "votes": 12}, "heading": "The dark heart of Star Wars", "date": "2007-08-05T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1706711", "sentiment score": [0.033, 0.3552, 0.434, 0.164, 0.0138]}, {"content": "A better movie than its predecessor (and successors) in every way \u0096 acting, story, direction, set design, writing, and a vastly more mature interrelationship between the love triangle of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and C-3PO\u0085 (I know what you're thinking, what about the triangle of Princess Leia Organa, Han Solo and Chewbacca?) Funnier (Solo is a scream), flirtier (sexual tension between Leia and Solo is almost as strong as that between Luke and Yoda), flamier (uh, C-3PO), *The Empire Strikes Back* is the most \"complete\" of any *Star Wars* effort, even though it is the only movie in the series with a beginning and a middle \u0096 but no end! Full credit to the film-makers for the decision to complete the third act *in the next movie!* (I don't perfunctorily credit hack director-writer George Lucas with this decision; about the most credit I'd give him after his atrocious track record of dumb-movies-that-look-slick is creating forward momentum for projects, ensuring they get green lighted, and creating alien names which would be stupid if they weren't so funny.) *Episode V* finds the Rebel Alliance on the ice planet Hoth, for no reason other than to flex efx muscle in the form of stop-motion Imperial \"AT-AT Walkers\" \u0096 probably the most poorly designed attack vehicles in the history of warfare.Supposedly \"All Terrain Armored Transport\" vehicles, yet resembling sick Indricotheriums, these lumbering behemoths move at the pace of a man running through snow \u0096 an attack speed of about 5 mph - with 4 guns covering only their anterior plane, leaving everywhere else completely exposed to assault from any enemy craft that can travel faster than the average tortoise; a strategic aspect which the Rebels either ignore or are too dumb to exploit, as they fly in hell-tilt FROM THE FRONT, instead of attacking from the rear, where the AT-AT Union wouldn't pay to put gunners \u0096 probably due to new worker compensation laws pertaining to getting what you deserve if you ride in a horse's ass.George's smart move in \"Empire\" was to hire a REAL director - Irvin Kershner (one of Lucas' teachers in film school). So even while the strategic lunacy of the AT-AT Walkers reeks of George's padawan paw prints, the film's other opening sequences compellingly show off the emotional ties between the love-hexagon of Han, Luke, Leia, Chewbacca and the 'droids, C-3PO and R2-D2.Luke has flown to Dagobah where he is accosted by Yoda: Jedi Master of 900 years and Fozzy Bear for the last four (a small green Muppet that Frank Oz operates and voices), who teaches Luke handstands so that if he fails Jedi School, he could fall back on Cirque du Soleil. Yoda's presence in this film counterpoints the frantic situations of the other characters. Amidst the furor of star wars, here was the Jesus character endorsing peace, tranquility, balance; a far cry from the scrapping avenger that Yoda would be turned into in the Prequel Trilogy, becoming more unbalanced with every Episode and by *Episode III*, light-sabering the Emperor with nary a thought about peaceable options, let alone knocking over kajillion dollar lamps and quinzullion dollar opera boxes. In creating the Prequel Trilogy, poor little Yoda was lost forever...Yet maybe the seeds of Yoda's (and by association, humanity's) downfall are sown in this episode: why study to be a Jedi Knight, a keeper of \"peace,\" by learning how to *battle*? If the Force informs all things and if the Jedi have tapped into that Force with their mind powers, why wield light-sabers at all? Approach anyone with a light saber dangling from your belt and that sends a pretty clear message in the *opposite* direction.As Yoda tells it, he has been pimping Jedi Knights into the galaxy under the pretense of religious harmony for nearly a millennium. Any wonder the Empire is so FUBAR? The grand encounter between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader in *Empire* is arguably the crux of the *Star Wars* saga. It doesn't get more pertinent, more urgent, more compelling. It is not so much the fencing \u0096 we've seen better; it is about coming-of-age, ready or not; it is the eternal struggle between fathers and sons, mentors and menials; it is the passing of the torch; it is facing up to facing down fear; it is the Dark warring with the Light in each of us \u0096 and realizing that sometimes\u0085 Dark is Better; a thematic juggernaut that spans eons and topples kingdoms.*Star Wars* is crystallized in these moments, featuring one of the greatest revelations in motion picture history, and also probably one of the most misquoted lines since, \"Play it again, Sam.\" Vader does *not* say, \"Luke, I am your father,\" but rather, in answer to Luke screaming, \"You killed my father!,\" Vader thooms, \"No! *I*\u0085 am your father!\" It still sends chills up my spine.But let's face it \u0096 we were GLAD it was Vader, weren't we? Better than that killjoy, Kenobi, or that self-righteous prig, Yoda. We all wish Vader were *our* father \u0096 YES, take me to Rule The Galaxy, collecting tithes and tributes and slave girls; teach me the ways of Big, Black, Smooth and Cool like your bad self!There is such magnetic resonance in the figure of Vader beseeching his son, that even though he had already been elevated to the pantheon of Great Screen Villains, yet we are caressed by his sincerity in being a sympathetic ruler and longing to reunite his family \u0096 or is that just the Dark Side drawing us in? The series would never again scale these lofty heights of grand dramatic slam. *The Empire Strikes Back*, brimming with hilarity, humanity and paternity, is the best of the *Star Wars* series.And that's not just our imagination.(Read this article unabridged at: www.poffysmoviemania.com/StarWarsEmpireStrikesBack.html)", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Empirical Satirical", "date": "2007-06-24T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1680417", "sentiment score": [0.0053, 0.0274, 0.1186, 0.6415, 0.2072]}, {"content": "Picking up where Star Wars left off, \"Empire Strikes Back\" is the 5th episode in the trilogy, and second film in the series. In this film, Princess Leia, Han Solo R2-D2 and C-3P0 tried to flee the Galatic Empire, but are later captured by Lord Darth Vader. Luke Skywalker is getting Jedi training by Yoda (his first appearance in the series). We see a determined Skywalker trying to master the technique of being a Jedi, and attempt to rescue his friends. What results is another film full with imagination, character development, action and suspense. One of the best heroic scenes, I think, in the movie is when Skywalker tries to master the technique of moving and lifting objects using the Force. The element of friendship and love continue in this film, as we see a growing teamwork bond between C-3PO and Chewbacca, and a love interest between Princecss Leia and Han Solo; all the human drama blends in well with the sci-fi action. Also, Billy Dee Williams first appears as Lando Calrissian, who join forces with Han Solo and the crew to battle Darth Vadar.Another brilliant story by George Lucas, good direction by Irvin Kershner. They provided one of the more fast-paced and exciting movies in the Star Wars franchise, entertaining any viewer without dragging on the plot. Thre is a rousing music score by John Williams. His \"Imperial March\" is without a doubt one of his best scores, both militaristic and haunting. It is my brother's favorite work of Williams.

The sword fight in this film is faster and cooler, and the dramatic lines at the end is great. Han Solo and Princess Leia were made for each other, and Han Solo's last scene in the film shows how much he has matured as an actor.There were two things that bothered me about this film, though. The first is the first 15 minutes of the film. It's just a very weak opening, and it seems longer than it actually it is. However, that is made up for by the amazing battle scene on Hoth. Another is when Luke and Leia kiss; it just doesn't seem right.Other than that, the movie hit perfection on technically every level.

Whenever I hear someone say 'I'll try', I already know it's a cop out with no intention of getting involved with the task in question.

Yeah OK, he's a puppet, but the character of Yoda is like the Spock of the SW universe, a stabilizing force (Force?) who helps Luke remain grounded and in control of his emotions.I recall some disappointment the first time I saw this film during it's original theatrical release relative to the Han Solo cliffhanger, somehow I felt it took away from the structure I was looking for in the chapter following the original \"Star Wars\". Viewing it today I don't feel the same way. It dealt a momentary reprieve to the Han/Leia romance and allowed for analysis of the Darth/Luke relationship. Vader's attempt to shield his son from the Emperor by promising a turn to the Dark Side was ingeniously turned on it's head with Vader suggesting young Skywalker use his power to defeat the Emperor. The scene was cleverly done and Luke's response hinted at things to come in \"Return Of The Jedi\".My most recent viewing of this episode was only the third time since the original theatrical release, and I find that it hasn't lost any of it's impact, maintaining a vitality and excitement that time hasn't diminished. Watching the remastered DVD version, particularly with the sub titles, offers an entirely new perspective when you can pause and rewind to understand better what certain characters said. Perhaps that's why I found it a lot easier to keep track of the fine points of the story, place names like Hoth, Yavin and Bespin, and secondary characters like Governor Tarkin.

As far as quality it closely ranks to the original, and in terms of character development, and plot and as far as the storytelling goes it's probably better than the 1977 original. Directed this time around by Irvin Kershner he does just as good a job with the sets, characters, and special effects work as Lucas did making it just as good as 1977's. Here the saga now has a setting on the ice planet of Hoth, a place that the Rebels have hid from the evil empire in pursuit, with the real goal they have is to reach the fabulous city of Bespin nicknamed Cloud City for it's airy view. Here's when this installment becomes a real coming of age sequel in which the central character Luke Skywalker comes of age both in terms of skill and mind, and that's when he makes a stop in the swamp of Dagobah. It is in the swamps that hold an important part of the saga and the development of the Skywalker character is found here by training with the appearance of the Jedi master Yoda(hey, nice little green puppet!) as Luke's skill of mind and fighting ability is formed making one reason that Episode V is so important. Later a dark secret is revealed, by Darth Vader in the climax at cloud city, and it was just great to see the fierce battle between Luke and Vader to close out this installment. Overall \"The Empire Strikes Back\" might be the best of the saga in terms of the coming of age development of the central character(Luke).

It is not going to be as large as my older comments but this is still a fair size none the less. Anyway, about the film, this is not the best movie of all time, but is it the best Star Wars movie of all time? I think so. This is of course the fifth Star Wars movies, but the second in the order of release.First, the acting. The acting is fantastic. Each character has more depth than they use to, too. There was also no cheesy lines, unlike Star Wars IV. Star Wars IV had a really cheesy line, but I mentioned that particular line in my comment for IV. Secondly, the special effects. The special effects are really cleaned up and polished to make everything in the movie look nice and smooth. The effects are also ahead of its time, which is definitely a good thing. The Lightsaber effects are also brilliantly done. The hyperspace scenes also look amazing and are incredible to look at, and look way better than the original Star Wars movie, but that was made in 1977 and this was made in 1980, so I am not complaining.Thirdly, the plot. The plot itself is much darker than the plot for the original Star Wars. The plot is one of the many reasons why this is the darkest Star Wars movie. Revenge of the Sith is the second darkest, but this plot is brilliant and well-written. It is also more difficult.Here is the plot. Sith Lord Darth Vader is after Luke Skywalker. After a battle on the planet Hoth Luke takes personal Jedi-training lessons of the Force from Master Yoda, who is a brilliant and small green little Jedi master who is over eight hundred years old.Meanwhile, Han Solo and Princess Leia and Chewbacca and C3-PO and R2D2 go to Cloud City where Han's friend Lando Calarissian is. The only problem is that it is a trap. Darth Vader is there and captures them. He forces Han to lure Luke there. Luke goes to Cloud City to rescue them. Darth Vader wants to put Luke in a freezing chamber. They test it out on Han. He becomes frozen and it taken by Bounty Hunter Boba Fett. Then, Lando, Leia, Chewbacca, C3-PO, and R2D2 escape.After that, Luke goes into the freezing chamber. Darth Vader is there waiting for him. They have a Lightsaber duel. Vader cuts off Luke's hand and tells him that he is his father. Luke does not believe him obviously. Vader persuades him to come to the Dark Side. Luke escapes and is rescued by Leia.

Luke learns the way of the Jedi from Yoda, a wise, green, raspy alien who looks like the child of Kermit and Miss Piggy (which makes sense, considering Miss Piggy was also voiced by Frank Oz).The movie also shows Han, Chewie, Leia, and C-3PO running from the Empire in many well-visualized locales-- the asteroid field, the space slug, and Cloud City, among others. 3PO slapstick reaches a feverish high, and somehow that isn't half bad.Following suit for \"More American Graffiti\" (1979), Lucas leaves the director's chair for Irvin Kershner, whose almost terrifying directorial style is much better suited to this darker story.

This chapter of the Star Wars saga is unique in that it is neither directed, nor written by Luca$. Irvin Kershner directs and Leigh Brackett & Lawrence Kasdan are the credited writers of this screenplay. I consider that is why it is widely thought of as the best of the OT: Luca$ neither directed, nor wrote it. This is perhaps one of the most successful sequels of all time. While it rates an 8.7/10 at the Internet Movie Database, and IV rated an 8.8/10, there is a large school of thought whereby the idea is expressed that this installment of the Luca$ Money Machine is superior to the original. I must say that I subscribe to this notion. The story featured is darker, while maintaining the same charm and enjoyability as Episode IV. There is less action and more story, and that is fine by me. I was as enchanted by the plot as I was roused by the action. There are no obvious plot holes (at least, not yet. Episode III has not yet been released); no contrivances. Everything fits nicely into its place and feels properly nestled within. There has been much speculation as to the meaning of Yoda's words to Obi-Wan concerning \"the other.\" \"That boy is our last hope.\" Obi-Wan \"No. There is another.\" Yoda Most casual fans of this franchise, affectionately known as the Luca$ $tar War$ $aga or the Luca$ Money Machine, tend to believe that Yoda refers to Leia in that statement, and indeed, Obi-Wan does confirm that it was Leia about whom Yoda spoke. But I have always had another thought about that. Since there are further Star Wars stories, not to mention countless novels produced in the genre of \"fan fiction,\" and an enormous Expanded Universe, I am a bit timid to discuss my feelings here, but will force myself to expound upon my thoughts as a means of catharsis, if for no other reason. I believe Yoda referred to Han Solo. I have two reasons. There are more, to be sure, but I will detail only two; the most poignant, in my opinion. First, to activate the light saber, one must possess the proper mindset; that of a Jedi. Whether it is because of metichlorine-filled blood, a state of heart, or a Gods-given gift, that ability belongs to a Jedi alone. Joe-Blow from down the road couldn't activate a light saber. But Han did, in this Episode, when cutting open the Ton-Ton to save Captain Solo's life in the frozen wastelands of Hoth.Second. Han Solo has the ability to navigate a rather large freighter through an asteroid belt, with the controls set to \"manual.\" This type of ability was demonstrated in Episode IV to effectively demonstrate Luke's growing abilities as a Jedi.Han and Leia's relationship deepens, Chewy has a few pivotal scenes (his part is much more vocal and present in this chapter), and our favorite Droids are given the full star treatment. As I mentioned earlier, the theme here is much darker than was Episode IV. Lord Vader's copious presence goes a long way towards furthering that goal, as does the lighting, tone and mood of the musical score. The stormtroopers somehow seem more menacing, and Carrie Fisher's performance abilities seem to have doubled from her first Star Wars attempt. Mark Hamill's Luke Skywalker finally earns that battle scene with Vader which was promised in the first installment (or fourth, whatever), and we see the return of Obi-Wan (kind of).It is amusing to see Yoda play the part of a troublesome creature while testing Skywalker's demeanor and potential. Once he makes his determinations surrounding Skywlaker's training, his changes in tone and behavior back to that of the Jedi Master he is, were obvious. It was quite endearing to see him that way: Apparently made feral by the wild swampy jungle in which he dwells. And then to discover it was all just an act. Beautifully done. While this chapter appears at first viewing to depend completely upon the fourth and sixth Episodes for support, Episode V does have a noticeable beginning, climax, and ending. The elements of that beginning, climax, and ending; however, do depend upon those other Episodes to explain it and uplift it. You must subscribe to the mindset of the fourth chapter in order to comprehend the subtle meanings of what takes place. Without knowledge of Episode IV, this is just another popcorn movie. An incredibly done popcorn movie, but a popcorn movie, nonetheless. But with that knowledge, this movie is instantly elevated to that of the \"Superior Sequel\" in that the story is far richer, the execution feels much more natural, and the conclusion is an excellent cliffhanger even though there is an obvious end.While it is superior, it lacks the level of newness the original possessed.

This may have to do with the absence of George Lucas as director, but the most conspicuous examples of this film's qualities are the improved acting of the leads since their appearance in the original, new memorable and interesting characters, and a compelling storyline.Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher are slightly better than they were in the original. Luke Skywalker still seems a bit green and immature, but he undergoes some transformation as he undergoes his Jedi training with Yoda. For a rubber puppet, Yoda is a magnificent character. He embodies the mature spiritual and moral characteristics that Lucas wanted the Jedi to embody. He warns Luke not to yield to his dark visions of his friends' suffering, and that he must instead complete his training. It is Yoda, rather than Obi-Wan, who truly leads Luke down the long and arduous path to being a Jedi. Frank Oz, despite sounding like one of his myriad Muppet characters, brings a calm, almost dispassionate persona to Yoda. This great Jedi Master is a welcome addition to this movie.Another new interesting character is Lando Calrissian, played elegantly by Billy Dee Williams. Calrissian, like Han Solo, is morally ambiguous, and is forced to betray his old friend after Han and Leia have been intercepted by Darth Vader and the mercenary Boba Fet. He is a almost a mirror image to the roguish Han Solo, though his switch to the side of the good guys seems rather abrupt. Overall, Williams plays his rather secondary role admirably.One of the few characters to improve is Lord Vader. James Earl Jones has trained his voice to match Vader's ruthlessness and lack of empathy. He plays the bad guy as calm, cool, contemplative, and almost emotionless, which matches Vader's spiritual nature (his devotion to the Dark Side) and which amplifies the character's ability to intimidate audiences. If Vader were some cackling, maniacal supervillian, no one would take his menace seriously. The scriptwriter deserves some credit for making Vader far more sadistic and evil than he was in the original, e.g. his willingness to risk his own men's lives in an asteroid field, and his penchant for strangling a series of Imperial officers for simple mistakes. David Prowse, the man in the Darth Vader costume, also does very well here.The story is better than the first because it moves beyond the simple \"damsel in distress\" and \"good-triumphs-over-evil\" themes of the first. The good guys do not triumph either in the beginning or the end, and we also learn that the Force is a more complex power than the original movie suggested, e.g. that yielding to one's emotions, even to save one's friends, is a dangerous gamble. The actions scenes and special effects are equal, if not better, than the first movie's. The settings of the ice planet of Hoth, the swamp world of Dagobah, and the glittering white Cloud City mining camp are beautifully rendered. This, like the first movie, is not high art, but it is a very competent and mature science fiction movie.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Best of the Star Wars Franchise, and Most Fun to Watch", "date": "2007-03-04T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1611624", "sentiment score": [0.0016, 0.024, 0.4302, 0.5253, 0.019]}, {"content": "After destroying the Death Star, the heroes set off into another adventure where the try to destroy the empire created by the menacing Dart Vader(David Prowse).

Initially many people were disappointed with its cliffhanger ending. I know I wouldn't want to wait three years for the answer to the \"big question\" that was surely on everyone's minds! Anyway, I think Empire has become widely respected for its maturity in comparison to the other Star Wars movies. It's much more dramatic than A New Hope, and it doesn't have the cutesy aspects of Return of the Jedi. Until Revenge of the Sith, Empire was the darkest Star Wars movie. Empire clearly beats it in the execution department though. All of the characters are put into the worst situations imaginable and have to fight their way out.I think Empire's greatest strength is the character development of Luke, Han, and Leia. Luke faces his greatest fear (confronting Vader) and a romance blooms between Han and Leia. While the script and the performances are not Oscar worthy I do think this Star Wars movie has the best performances in the series. I believe this is largely due to Irvin Kirshner taking over the director's helm for Lucas. Lucas is notorious for not being very good with actors; his trademark instructions are \"do it faster and more intense.\" Kirshner and Producer Gary Kurtz made sure a lot of care went into the character moments. Personally I don't think Lucas would have done that. Another aspect I like is the fact that the character development is very well balanced, so it doesn't feel like any of the principle characters are just tag-alongs, like in ROTJ. Darth Vader becomes the ultimate bad ass here in his hunt for Luke. My favorite Vader line: \"The Force is with you young Skywalker... but you are not a Jedi yet.\" The lightsaber duel is my favorite of the series as well. There was something evil about the Carbon Freezing Chamber, perhaps it was that red glow.Empire brought us to some of the best locations in the series, such as the swamp planet Dagobah, the ice planet Hoth, and Cloud City. This happens to be the only Star Wars movie that doesn't have Tattooine. The snow speeder battle contains some excellent stop motion animation which holds up very well today. It certainly was unusual to put the major dogfight scene in the beginning of the movie rather than at the end, but I don't think many people complained.We are also introduced to new characters like Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch), and Yoda. Frank Oz's performance is nothing short of amazing. He deserves a great deal of credit for turning a rubber puppet into a living, breathing person. Like Lucas said, if that puppet hadn't worked the whole movie would have been lost. One valid criticism of Empire is that the action really just stops once Luke lands on Dagobah. I can't say I was ever bored by Empire's middle act. I found Luke's Jedi training and Han and Leia's moments to be thoroughly entertaining. However, I can perfectly understand why a casual moviegoer would be bored by this act.

The original \"Star Wars\" was a success in my opinion because it had three things: \u0097 a collection of images from other films, distinctly referencing them. Some were film- schoolish like the Kurosawa quotes. But most were like what Kurosawa himself referenced: already deeply embedded visual touchstones, not having lost their power in becoming clich\u00e9s. These were collected in one large form, the Flash Gordan form let's call it, which all of us slightly knew. It could be recalled with enough familiarity to register but not enough to set expectations, so Lucas could fill the bucket with whatever he found and liked.\u0097 a notion of a complete, understandable cosmology. Its the noir notion that laws of the universe exist and cannot be seen, and if they could they wouldn't be comprehensible. This notion is deep in film, so deep that when a movie comes along that posits a cosmology that is whole, and revealable, it shocks. What that movie did was give us enough of a glimpse into this to believe that we could understand the world, at least THIS world of the \"galaxy far away.\" Remember when that original came out? The images were impressible, but what people talked about wasn't what they saw, but about how the world worked. It settled first in an ersatz religion among geeky kids and now has been swallowed by the \"simple\" US religions, and its presidential representative.\u0097 the notion of a quest. Its an old form, but cast in the above noted situation, it takes new power. The traditional form, the Goethe-Lytton form was there to remind and reveal mysteries. Here it is clearer, to explain. There was a lowbrow professor at the time of a women's college that a TeeVee interviewer made popular. It was sort of a metaquest. This simple man said that we could actually understand the nature of trying to understand nature. It was a lucky break for Lucas, because it meshed with this shocking notion of a grand cosmology that we know our hero (check out the name: \"sky walker\") will grasp, master and show us.That was the first film. A huge success, just huge. It did change many things, but from my perspective the key thing was how it reset that great American invention of noir, as important as jazz, and liberty which form a sort of trilogy of contradictory, three-way tension.Okay. Now the second big Ted idea, the necessity for the equal size of steps in abstraction when you have two steps. It seems this is hardwired in the brain, a sort of human quantum mechanics. If you look back along the abstraction, say a cartoon in a cartoon, the distance between the two will be precisely the same as the surrounding cartoon.So, when they made the second Star Wars movie, they could reference the previous one in the way that it referenced its cinematic background. It had a writer in Kasden who knew how to do this. And it had a director in Lucas' film school teacher who did also. Neither had a huge hit other than this because it was such a cool setup, having such a thing to build on.You'll read lots about trying to humanize, and how faces were used. But all that is simply in the service of abstracting closer to us from the original, in equal portion. This is the son. Why did the franchise fail after this?

A gambler, smuggler and old friend of Han he has entered into a tenuous deal with Vadar to protect his city but in the process must betray his old friend to the Empire.Perhaps the most iconic and best loved of all the characters is not a human at all but a small green puppet who likes talking backwards.

Of course, if you haven't seen the first film, and by that I mean the original 1977 entry, then get that under your belt first so you aren't completely lost.The last part of that last statement may not actually happen because of the way the film is made. Even though it pretty much picks up where first one left off, you can put this film by itself and still be highly entertained and greatly impressed.There are a lot of things to love about The Empire Strikes Back. The villain, Darth Vader, is better than ever. His dialogue may be some of the best ever written. Lines like \"You have failed me for the last time\" and \"Don't make me destroy you,\" when taken into context, really blow you away as far as meaning and even enunciation. James Earl Jones is definitely a candidate for our greatest voice of all time.Vader's not the only one spouting out great lines. A new character, in the form of a Muppet, might just steal the show. The fact that you are watching a puppet teach Luke Skywalker the ways of the force and you totally buy it really goes to show you how creative this movie is. The mannerisms of Yoda are so spot on that you think you're actually watching a person.A movie with the greatest villain of all time and the best use of a puppet can't have any more to offer, right? You tell me that again once you've seen the Battle of Hoth through the eyes of the soldiers staring down those AT-ATs. As soon as you've seen that, you may claim that you've seen everything. Why more movies don't use miniatures and stop-motion animation is beyond me. After this film set the bar as high as it did, you'd think people would want to have their epic films at least look realistic like this one.If those amazing feats aren't enough for you, try dodging asteroids while being chased by TIE Fighters, searching through the murky swamps of Dagobah in search of the greatest of all Jedi masters, or fighting the Dark Lord of the Sith atop Cloud City. Yes, The Empire Strikes Back has enough action to keep you on the edge of your seat for the duration.For those of you who like a little more substance with your style, look no further. As I said before the dialogue is crisp and really makes you think. The romance between Han and Leia may have as much tension as that climactic lightsaber fight. Even the comedy is well played and timed. The movie also has one of the best, if not the best, ending ever shot on film.The Empire Strikes Back is one for the ages. A film so jam-packed with literal awesomeness that you may need to pick up your jaw when the end credits start rolling. Crank up the sound, sit back, relax, and then prepare to get blown away by the second, or possibly fifth, chapter in the Star Wars saga.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "\"Do Or Do Not.

That said though very few films have been carried by the visual trickery alone, Episode V could not simply have been an effects driven film as this would have meant that it offered nothing new to the Star Wars saga. I do, though, love the visual effects in this film. In my opinion they are the best of any of the six episodes my reasoning for this is that although you can tell a few things have been faked it is nothing like episodes I, II and III where nothing looks real due to excessive and often unnecessary use of CGI.Brilliant as the effects are though they never upstage the actors (as they do in subsequent Star Wars films). Mark Hamill is at his most convincing in Episode V this though, I think, is largely due to a script that gives his character much more depth than in Episode IV. The conflicts within Luke are very well played out, his frustration with Yoda, his inability to control the force and his eventual recklessness in choosing to face Vader, without completing his training, present the very real prospect that he might succumb to the dark side - indeed when I first saw this film I felt Luke would have no choice but to submit to Vader after their duel on Bespin.Elsewhere the love story between Han and Leia develops gradually becomes more intense as the film progresses. There is the hilarious verbal sparing whilst the battle rages on Hoth followed by the tender scene on the Falcon in the asteroid field where Han and Leia admit their feelings for one another. All this builds up to the highly charged scenes in Cloud City where Leia expresses doubts about Han's staying power before accepting, as Han is about to be frozen, that she loves him (which of course he knew anyway!). I would say that Harrison Ford gives his best performance as Han Solo in Episode V as he actually has his own story line where as in Epiosde IV he is almost there for delivering (great) one-liners whilst he cuts a bit of a peripheral figure in Episode VI Perhaps what I love most about this film though is the more subtle touches and the little things that make the whole thing real and something that you can relate too. For example I love that moment where Han Solo hits the Falcon's control panel after it fails to light up - haven't we all been there?. Then there's the constant bickering that occurs (especially between Han and Leia) that makes the characters so real. Meanwhile Vader is at his most menacing - proving that the empire has most certainly struck back. Although at the end when Admiral Piett is expecting to be swiftly executed after the escape of the Millennium Falcon (as Admiral Ozell and Captain Niedhar were before him). However Vader chooses to let Piett be cleverly suggesting that Vader's meeting with Luke has altered Vader substantially an advertising that often actions speak louder than words.The only problem with this film (apart from being at the whim of George Lucas) is that you really need to see episodes IV and IV to fully understand it therefore meaning that as a stand alone film it's not quite as perfect as it is in the context of the other films in the saga. Indeed if you read my comment you'll probably see that most of my observations are relative to the other Star Wars film. However as episodes IV and VI are great films you've really nothing to lose by watching the whole lot.

Now we can see the original matte work and effects, which are quite beautiful accomplishments and stand among the best of their era.The film is the best directed of the entire series, suffering from none of Lucas' poor directing of actors and Marquand's tentative camera handling. That said, Kershner himself is not an exceptional director except insofar as how he works with actors and his light comic touch. This film relies heavily on storyboarding and sticking fairly closely to its script, which was penned by Lucas himself from a draft by the great Leigh Brackett, with further refinement by Lawrence Kasdan.The story takes the characters from the original film, with the addition of the charming Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), further along their personal and political quests. The film does a good job of developing these characters far beyond what their potential in the original film or their treatment in the disappointing subsequent \"Jedi\" were able to suggest, and of tying in the development of the characters' relationships with each other parallel to the plot of the film. The only unfortunate aspect in terms of the film's pacing is that the most exciting battle sequences fall so early in the film, leaving us a bit let down by the film's dialog-heavy middle section until we get to the stirring (and somewhat dark) conclusion in Cloud City.It's notable that this is almost the only Star Wars film that does not feature the desert planet Tatooine. This can be seen as symbolic of the fact that this was the film that George Lucas had the least to do with -- Tatooine represents his hometown of Modesto in the other films. I also do not consider it a coincidence that this, almost universally acknowledged by fans as the best in the series, was the one with which George Lucas had the least involvement. I've always believed that a lot of the credit for the success of these first 2 films should belong to the producer Gary Kurtz, a fellow USC grad who cut his teeth working with Roger Corman (producing Monte Hellman's first films) and who developed these 2 films' concept of \"used space\" visual design which was later abandoned in favor of a glossy more standard \"new space\" look. These 2 productions are on a higher level overall than anything that Lucas did after the partnership ended, which is particularly striking in that the excessively bright and shiny \"Jedi\" followed only a few years later. Kurtz went on to produce \"The Dark Crystal\" -- a superior production IMHO to any of Lucas' solo (read: non Spielberg/Kurtz) efforts.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "The best in the original trilogy", "date": "2007-01-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1567672", "sentiment score": [0.0018, 0.009, 0.0855, 0.7547, 0.1489]}, {"content": "I can only speculate in Episode IV that because Vader realized that his Imperial battle station was destroyed by the rebel force, his own ship went back to one of the Star Destroyer ships. This is because at the start of Episode V, you see Vader on one of those Star Destroyers.Those Imperial space ships, which looks like a slice of cheese in white with their big triangular shapes, also appear in earnest in Episode VI, but I think I am going to jump ahead......The only exciting part in Episode V seems to be when the small band of rebel fighters destroy two of the Imperial walkers, which look like large metallic horses in white, armed with 2 twin cannons. One rebel fighter used a harpoon string to knock out one walker; the other fighter actually was brave enough to get into the underbelly of the walker, rig that area with a thermal bomb, and then the bomb blew up causing that walker to go down for good.Another exciting part was the awful part---you still witness Vader's evil wizardry, including the part when he magically chokes to death one of the Star Destroyer officers for failing to stop the rebel forces soon enough.Besides the confrontation of the rebel forces with the Imperial walkers, the action in Episode V was less exciting than all of the other Star Wars flicks, but you see things that you normally see in space--an asteroid field where some of the Imperial ships chasing some of the rebel fleet were destroyed, and of course, the different colors of the planets.Of course, like any Star Wars movies, there are quiet moments in Episode V through those famous clashes involving light sabres and ship attacks. The quiet moment that I had to carefully look into was Luke's Jedi training with Yoda while Luke was on Dagobah. This Jedi training was a little bit like army boot camp and prison torture, especially when Luke, in a handstand, uses the force to try to move a heavy object.Well, the conclusion of the flick doesn't involve an explosion, but instead, it is in two parts: Vader fighting against Luke, and also Han Solo being condemned to be frozen alive in a carbonite casket. Some of the Star Wars fans may have been a little sad to see one of the good guys being frozen alive.In addition, there was even larger tension when the Star Destroyer was going to use the tractor beam on the Millennium Falcon after Luke, who confronted Darth Vader on Cloud City and lost his hand in a light sabre fight, says that he will never turn to the dark side of the force, although Vader says by doing so, he can save the galaxies from further doom. In other matters, Han Solo, after rescuing Luke from Vader, finds out that the Falcon had its hyperspace drive tampered with. It seemed like hope was going to be destroyed fast for the good guys on the Falcon with the tractor beam on the Vader ship about to be activated on the Falcon, until that miracle droid, R2-D2, found a way to repair the hyperspace drive control, and just like that, like as if it was fired from gun, the Falcon disappears into space at light speed. Vader is shocked. Well, you see a little good in him....I anticpated that he would magically choke the new Star Destroyer admiral for letting the Falcon escape, but he decides not to, and focuses his ideals on the construction of a second Death Star...which will appear in earnest in Episode VI.The final shots of the movie, as I found out, is Sullust, a rebel staging area in space (not on a planet), where the Falcon is rescued by large rebel fleet mostly made of transport ships and frigate ships, and will play a very major part in Episode VI.

However calling this movie the best sequel ever made alone is not enough. It's so much more than just a sequel and it's overall one of the best movies ever made.Everything you could wish for is in this movie. Adventure, humor, romance, action, great characters. It's all told in a fast pace but never at the expense of the character development or story. \"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back\" is known and regarded as the darkest movie out of the two Star Wars trilogies. It's dark not in terms of visual style, after all Cloud City is one of the brightest cities you've ever seen in a movie, but more dark in terms of the story, characters and emotions. Basically in this story it's the evil Empire that prevails over the Rebels. Evil sides in movies are often the more interesting ones and this movie is perhaps the very best example of that. The ultimate movie villain Darth Vader is more evil than ever in this movie and doesn't even spare his own commanders.But it's not only the dark side that makes this movie different from any other Star Wars movie. Also the storytelling is different. For instance there is no big battle at the ending and the ending is actually an open one. Instead the biggest and most exciting battle is already in the beginning of the movie; the Imperial ground attack on the Rebel base, with giant walking tanks, AT-AT's. It still is one of the best and most memorable battle sequences out of movie history. Also not in the least because it's not set in cold dark space but on the white snow planet Hoth. It makes the battle unique and therefor all the more memorable.But don't worry the movie is not all dark and depressing, there also is room for entertainment. Luckily all the things that made \"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope\" such a great classic and entertaining movie are still present here. The movie brings back all of the main characters and chooses the develop them even further. Especially the Han/Leia romance gets developed in a great non-formulaic way. Luke's character gets more vulnerable (especially of course after the famous classic Darth Vader revaluation sequence). He's not a real hero but more a character that struggles with his own future and past. The C-3PO and R2-D2 characters are yet again present as the comical relief of the movie. It works in a great non-distracting way, unlike perhaps was often the case in the new Star Wars trilogy. But the movie also leaves room to introduce some new big characters. Yoda is the best example of this. It was a big gamble to let a puppet play a significant role in the movie. But the character works very well and is not a laughable one. This is also really thanks to his performer and voice Frank Oz, who makes it a real character, that over the years has grown out to be one of the best known and likable characters and also thanks to Mark Hamill who's acting with Yoda also makes the character more believable and a life one, instead of simply a puppet. Also Lando Calrissian who is energetically played by Billy Dee Williams, is a new character in this movie and a welcome addition to the cast. But also of course lots of villains are introduced such as some cool Imperial officers and also Emperor Palpatine makes his first small appearance in this movie. But the most welcome new addition is Boba Fett, who is one of the coolest characters out of movie history, even though he has hardly any lines or action to do in this movie. His presence alone is good and cool enough on its own, to make a lasting impression. But it are not only the characters that make the movie entertaining. The movie also features lots of fast paced spectacular action and some well written and placed comical dialog, that are all perfectly performed by the wonderful cast, who all share some great chemistry together. The movie is good looking with some highly convincing special effects, even by todays standards. It provides the movie with some spectacular and impressive memorable sequences. The cinematography by Peter Suschitzky sets up the perfect mood for this movie and Suschitzky is perhaps one of the most underrated cinematographers in the business at the moment, with already movies like \"The Man in the Iron Mask\", \"Mars Attacks!\", \"The Vanishing\" and the David Cronenberg movies \"eXistenZ\", \"Spider\" and \"A History of Violence\" behind his name. Also all of the characters and sets are highly convincing looking, something that was still lacking a bit at times in \"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope\". The musical score by John Williams is a true classic and perhaps the best or at least most memorable out of all the Star Wars soundtracks, mainly of course due to the Imperial March that can first be heard in this movie. It all combined is the reason why this movie is such a classic perfect masterpiece, that is as good as flawless, which helps to make this movie one of the best ever made.Not just the best Star Wars movie but also one of the best movies of all time.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 3}, "heading": "Not just one of the best sequels ever made, not just one of the best science-fiction movies ever made but also one of the best movies ever made.", "date": "2006-10-27T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1507599", "sentiment score": [0.0034, 0.0131, 0.0611, 0.443, 0.4794]}, {"content": "'Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back' is a phenomenal film.

If you have read Harry Potter Order of the Phoenix and seen the movie then see what you think of this.First of all:Luke Skywalker= Harry Potter Han Solo= Sirius Black Darth Vader = Lord Voldemort Yoda and Obi Wan Kenobi= Combination of Snape and Dumbledore. A bit tenuous I know but hear me out.Right. 1) Luke Skywalker and Harry are both believed by the good forces in both cases to be the one with the power to destroy the evil, in their respective cases Vader and Voldemort2) In Ep 5 Luke is close to Han Solo, a sort of elder brother who looks out for him. underlined when Han rescues Luke on Hoth. In the same way Sirius Black is harry's guardian, with a close link with harry and someone who is always looking out for him. Both Han and Sirius have rough edges to them compared to harry and Luke.3) Both Voldemort and Vader know that Harry and Luke care deeply for Sirius and Han so they devise plans to trap harry and Luke by using the bait of Sirius and Han. Harry begins to dream about the department of mysteries where he will eventually see Sirius tortured by Voldemort. Luke begins to visualise Han in danger. Both Vader and Voldemort use their physic skills to project vision's to Luke and harry as to draw them into the trap.4) The forces of good, being Obi wan Kenobi and Dumbledore both realise the threat and ask trusted friends, Yoda and Snape to teach Luke and harry to repel these visions being sent by the evil forces. Luke begins Jedi training under Yoda who attempts to convince him that confronting Vader before his is ready would be foolish, and that he could TURN TO THE DARK SIDE!!!!! Snape begins teaching occlumency to harry to enable him to prevent Voldemort's incursions into his dreams5) Both Luke and Harry become frustrated with the teaching and in one way or another it ends. I know this is tenuous because Snape ended harry's lessons whereas Yoda wanted Luke to continue but it still just about sticks together. Luke receives more visions of Han in danger and leaves Dagobah to confront against the dire warnings of Kenobi and Yoda. Harry sees Sirius being tortured by Voldemort in the department of mysteries and rushes off to save him despite Hermione's's protests.6) Although Han is actually at the planet whereas Sirius arrives after harry, both are peripheral to Vader and voldemort who only care about deposing of Luke and harry. Vader tries to persuade Luke to join him but probably would have killed him if he hadn't jumped off the platform. Voldemort wants the prophecy but tries to kill harry as well. In Han's case he is put in mortal danger through the carbon freezing process, whereas Sirius is killed. The intervention of allies saves Luke and harry from certain death and both escape, albeit at a great cost, Luke his arm and harry his guardian.There you have it.

The Empire Strikes Back does indeed seem like the stuff of dreams. The images, the music, a beautiful princess, a city floating in the clouds,...the atmosphere is surreal and unearthly. One critic aptly stated that it was hard to believe this movie was even filmed on earth. This epic battle of good versus evil in a galaxy far, far away has elements of all your favorite space, fantasy, and swashbuckler stories. It strikes a responsive chord somewhere deep in your memory. Again Luke says it best with his observation that \"there's something familiar about this place.\"From the outset, Empire Strikes Back was in a class by itself, far outshining its two companions in the trilogy, Episodes Four and Six. Even the newest Star Wars offerings, Episodes One, Two, and Three don't quite measure up to this 1980 blockbuster. George Lucas now has access to much more wondrous technology to tell his stories but he has fallen into the trap of relying too heavily on computer-generated images. When this technique is overdone what you end up with looks kind of like a Bugs Bunny cartoon. That's okay while you're trying to find a good seat in the theater, but when the actual movie starts the audience expects to see something a little more real. By contrast, when you watch ESB you have to keep REMINDING yourself that it's not real! That's the highest compliment you can pay a sci-fi movie. Well, Empire is back in the stores again. For a limited time of course. I look forward to the day Congress declares this movie a national treasure like The Wizard of Oz. Then maybe George Lucas won't be able to yank it off the store shelves whenever he feels like it. If you're like me, a Star Wars fan from way back, it's time to get reacquainted with an old friend.

I will never forget walking out of the theatre in 1980 and remarking to my best friend: \"we waited 3 years for THAT?!?!?\"So what's so wrong with Empire? I could go on at length, but essentially it boils down to 3 major problems. (1) Yoda. Yoda is the single most annoying character in the Star Wars trilogy (yes, that does include the awful Jar Jar Binks), and after a weak start on Hoth, the entire movie goes down the toilet when Yoda appears on screen. Yoda looks like a puppet (big surprise -- he IS a puppet), and sounds like every other Frank Oz character; I kept waiting for him to say \"Whacka Whacka\" like Fozzie Bear (I love Fozzie, in case you're wondering). The entire sequence on Yoda's home turf, which is crucial to the movie, just plain doesn't work. It doesn't look otherworldly, it just looks like a poorly lit set. (2) Lando. If we place Jar Jar as the 2nd most annoying character, then Lando is clearly a very close #3. Billy Dee Williams may be a decent actor, but you'd certainly never know it from watching this ham-fisted performance. I have difficulty believing Lando is a living entity, much less a swashbuckling former-pirate. (3) The movie has no ending; it just sort-of stops and leaves you wondering why it wasn't better. I expected, I don't know, some sort of interesting plot resolution, not just a shot of the characters looking out the window. And, yes, I know \"Luke, I am your father\" was supposed to be the climax. Be honest, is there ANYBODY out there who didn't see this one coming at least an hour before it happens? I was only 14 when I saw the movie, and my reaction was \"yeah, no kidding.\" Other low points: the wretched \"ice monster\" effect, the hand-puppet asteroid monster, nearly all of the acting (these are the characters we loved in Star Wars?), and especially the directing. High Points: well, the effects are mostly amazing, particularly the asteroid sequence (other than the hand puppet).

The Empire, now under the command of Darth Vader (played by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones), sends effects wizard Phil Tippett's AT-AT walkers to the planet to lay siege to the Rebel base. Meanwhile, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) must journey (with unwilling robot ally R2-D2 accompanying him) to the swamp planet Dagobah to begin his training with venerable Jedi master Yoda (voiced by Frank Oz). In the meantime, swashbuckling pirate Han Solo (Harrison Ford) is on the verge of leaving the Rebel Alliance behind in favor of repaying his debts to intergalactic gangster Jabba the Hutt but his growing affections for Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) keep him, his ship the Millennium Falcon, and Wookie co-pilot Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) around and in service. After the Rebel base evacuation, Solo, Leia, Chewbacca, and droid C-3PO journey to Bespin's Cloud City to reunite with Han's old buddy Lando Calrissian (trilogy newcomer Billy Dee Williams). \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is the definition of a fantastic movie sequel. As stated, it's bigger and full of more surprises than the first entry. With more shootouts reminiscent of our favorite westerns, fearsome bounty hunters (including Boba Fett), more Force philosophy and a climatic lightsaber battle (that reveals a secret so big it deserves its own movie), it's everything a proper \"Star Wars\" picture should be. Just don't get too carried away with fantastic fan responses like this one.10/10", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "I know it's a little late but...", "date": "2006-05-28T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1379512", "sentiment score": [0.0072, 0.0579, 0.1927, 0.5814, 0.1609]}, {"content": "One of the rare sequels that arguably tops it's own classic predecessor, the second film in the original STAR WARS trilogy manages to seamlessly combine the cliffhanger thrills and good-natured humor of the original with a darker and more adult-oriented storyline. Producer/writer George Lucas (who also directed the first film) decided to pass the directorial duties over to semi-avant guard director Irvin Kershner (best known at the time for 1970's LOVING and 1972's UP THE SANDBOX), which proved to be an ingenious move. Kershner's dramatic background serves him well in helming the complex plot, and he pulls fully-rounded characterizations from the entire cast. The merging of Kershner's storytelling talents with Lucas' mastery of the film-making technique is the very heart of this, which is arguably the greatest space adventure ever.The film works in numerous ways. Scene-by-scene, the film continually tops itself with one startling set piece after another, yet the picture also gels perfectly together as cohesive roller-coaster ride of suspense, romance, and still-dazzling special effects - with even some philosophy effectively thrown into the mix. Many of the series most intriguing characters are introduced in this installment, including space-age playboy Lando Carlissian (charismatically played by Billy Dee Williams), ruthless bounty hunter Boba Fett (an unrecognizable Jeremy Bulloch), and especially the ultimate mystic Yoda (flawlessly voiced by Frank Oz). The notorious Emperor (voiced by the sinister Clive Revill) also makes a brief-but-memorable appearance that initiates an intriguing set up for the following film.The new cast of characters are seamlessly woven into the saga's vast tapestry, and perfectly compliment the returning cast members, most of whom are at their best in this film. Mark Hamill's seemingly perpetual man/child Luke Skywalker actually does an impressive deal of growing up in this installment, and the deeper characterization suits the winsome actor well. Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher are given a genuinely believable romantic subplot that never feels contrived or tacked on, and C-3PO (the delightful English actor Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 once again steal nearly every scene they appear in as the series' sparring robots. And this is to say nothing of Darth Vader's (once again eerily voiced by James Earl Jones) shocking revelation to Luke during the film's bravura climax, which is a plot twist that packed a major wallop back in 1980 and is still somewhat startling even today.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "The best of the trilogy; an awesome space adventure!", "date": "2006-05-25T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1376811", "sentiment score": [0.0021, 0.007, 0.0396, 0.5258, 0.4255]}, {"content": "Episode 5, or the middle one of the first (now second?) trilogy of the Star Wars saga, has a great rep these days. It wasn't met with the same delight when it first came out in 1980 and I still don't believe it's quite as good as the original Star Wars (or episode 4-A New Hope). Somehow, despite a much larger budget, the epic scope and fabulous feel of a new universe (a new galaxy far away) is not quite there with this entry. Maybe you can accomplish such a feeling only once. The rebels and heroes flit from the icy world of Hoth through an asteroid belt and end up in the cloud city of Bespin, but it strikes me as a very small, enclosed universe here. I also noted some overacting on the part of the main characters during the first sequence on Hoth, especially from Ford and Fisher - or maybe their lines were just poorly written. The easygoing charm of the first film was gone; yes, this episode was meant to be darker, more somber by comparison. But that doesn't mean the characters need to be awkward, rough shadows of their previous incarnations.This filmed episode seems to copy the adventure serials of the bygone era (the '30s & '40s) a bit too literally - note the abundant use of 'wipes' as transitions from scene to scene. It switches back and forth, back and forth, from the heroes, to Vader in his usual dark mood, to Luke meeting Yoda - not the smooth narrative of the first film. Each individual scene, of course, is a success, usually spectacular. The FX were state-of-the-art for the time. The Empire's vast vessels look great, inside and out. The entire sequence in the asteroid belt is almost mind-blowing. Then they meet Lando, played by Billy Dee Williams, who doesn't make an easy fit; he seems to hold back, saying his lines through a clenched jaw, as if saving himself for a better performance later. The entire story here appears to be a prep for when Vader encounters Luke helmet-to-face, or at least to when Vader first shows up at the cloud city and snatches Han's laser pistol.There are some nice touches, as well, with repetitive motifs, which usually can be tiresome but add a flavor of sophistication here. I especially liked Vader's method of replacing his admirals and captains - he wastes no time and makes it clear he really will not be trifled with. In fact, it says something that the more interesting scenes take place on the Empire's ships, with the villains - this seems to happen when the villains are well done. Williams' score, including the Empire's theme march, is fantastic. Of course, almost everything hinges on the connection between Vader and Luke, a hidden aspect of which remained secret until the very end of this chapter. It's a startling revelation that remains possibly the biggest surprise for an audience in film history and, to this day, when I hear Vader utter those words, a familiar chill still races through me.

Even with a big budget and built-in audience, it would have been easy to make a second-rate follow-up or even a dud bad enough to kill the franchise. Leigh Brackett's clever script, Irvin Kerschner's directorial craft, George Lucas's unprecedented production values & the energy & intensity of the cast allowed \"The Empire Strikes Back\" to set a standard for outer-space adventure that has never been equaled. Lucas's first original \"Star Wars\" story emphasizes the series's two great strengths: fantastic action & the wily, wicked Galactic Empire. After their hidden base is found & destroyed, the Rebel Alliance flees in disarray, with Solo (Ford), Princess Leia (Fisher), Chewbacca & the droids hotly pursued in the damaged Millennium Falcon by an Imperial fleet. Luke (Hamill) vanishes into a jungle planet to find Jedi mentor Yoda & complete his training. Story flaws, including the fact that Luke's training takes place in the same amount of time as the Millennium Falcon's pursuit & the introduction of important characters near the end of the film, are unnoticeable unless you're looking for them. The action starts early & never lets up, with the battle of the ice planet alone more than enough for any action film. But there's plenty more where that came from, with the amazing flight through the asteroid field & the lightsaber duel in the cloud city standing out. Ford makes the most of his opportunity of developing Solo as a charming \"scoundrel,\" with Fisher game as his reluctant love interest. Hamill, who isn't really leading-man material, is sufficiently believable as the peasant hero growing into an elite warrior. The New Age, Oriental \"Force\" (rarely called a \"religion\") gets more prominence in \"Empire\" but never bogs down into hokiness or boredom. All these elements combine to give the film a never-failing theme of harried heroes hounded by an evil force that is so vast, powerful & diabolically clever that the viewer is moved almost, but not quite, to despair--exactly where Kerschner wants us. This is outer-space fantasy, not science fiction, so don't look for any science. And despite \"The Force\" as a plot device, there's no point in looking too deeply for Heavy Themes or Subtle Meanings. In fact, subtlety of any kind was pretty much killed off by this and other Lucas & Spielberg films.

I have been intently working on trying to win this election and have come to the conclusion that I can't win this with just friends and family...I'm going to need the help of the millions of fans Star Wars has adopted for itself to win this contest so I've decided to write this letter to introduce myself and my ideas for the fan club presidency. I went back to school and got my GED. I went to college for Media Arts and Animation (because I wanted to be GL) and got my bachelors. I moved to Studio City, Ca to go to USC and started my real life, the one I envisioned when I was 5, and within 3 years I own multiple corporations, my dream houses, my dream cars, I don't do drugs or drink In essence, I have everything I have ever wanted for myself and I have Star Wars and George Lucas to thank for it, and my way of giving back is to take my place in the SW world and be the best damn Fan Club president anyone can. I have a few ideas for how I can make it better for us as fans : I feel that we are entering a very scary time in terms of our beloved Star Wars. For the first time in SW history we are in a realm of uncertainty as to what's going to happen next. For the entire time SW has been in our lives we knew there was going to be more, it was just a matter of time, and now, according to Lucas there will never be another film. Of course we're going to have the video games, the board games and the television shows and so on, but nothing, absolutely nothing can compare to watching the midnight showing of a new Star Wars film. It's probably the greatest experiences of my life and I don't want it to end! I feel that there is a way around this though. If there were more conventions than SW would stay alive forever. If we as fans can come together more frequently I believe SW would never leave us and its that simple. We need to urge LucasFilm to produce more functions in more cities all over the world in order to satisfy the needs of the true fans and as president this will be my number one priority. Not just every 3 years, but every year. Not in just one city but multiple cities. One of the things I found to be disturbing was that because it was in Indianapolis, and only in Indianapolis, it was extremely hard for a lot of people to come there. They would have to get time off work, save up money, and make room for this in their personal lives. These reasons deterred a lot of people away and that I feel is not fair to them. It should not cost an extrordinary amount of money and time to celebrate these films and now that there won't be any movies its all we have to look forward to as a group. If LucasFilm will not cooperate with this I feel that we should come together as a group and make it happen ourselves and as President of the fan club I would be more than happy to make all of the arrangements and make this happen! I also feel that SW fans are probably the most enlightened and creative people on the planet. We at an early age saw the talent that went into making these films and have been trying to find that talent within ourselves ever since, and the best part about it is many of us have but we don't know what to do with it!! Especially in a day and age where there are more film students than law students and a time where the world is the smallest its ever been in the history of the Earth. We as a society are watching films from England, France, Japan and so on and seeing the impact that SW has had on not just the USA, but the world!! I propose that if I become president I begin an organization where people from all over the planet can submit their artworks (not just SW stuff) and gain the assistance of people in the entertainment industry. From writing to storyboarding to CGI to film and all that has to do with it. An organization by SW fans for SW fans!! A way to come up and not need no one but ourselves to make it happen. If we took all the talent that is in the group of people that will read this letter and put it together in a serious way your talking American Zoetrope to the tenth power. Your talking about possibly the next wave of great filmmakers. A way for me to give back.I felt an obligation to do this. If I don't win this contest I want everyone who reads this to know how I feel about everything that has been going on around us in the SW society as an extremely concerned fan. I think that everyone I have ever met at the conventions and the midnight showings and the Weekends at Disney have been the greatest, greatest group of people this world has to offer, and I am so greateful that I'm a part of it.

The best part is when Luke Skywalker fights everybody's favorite the one and only... Darth Vader. But before I go into that I must tell you my review. This movie is the best in the series because it reveals the most secrets (Next to Episode III) and it is packed to the gills with action. This like all of the other ones has a lot of killing (BUT PARENTS LET YOUR KIDS SEE THIS MOVIE!)but the peoples faces are hidden beneath masks so there is little agony on peoples faces when they are shot with laser blasters. By this I am referring to Stormtroopers. In the beginning we are introduced to the new Rebel Base on Hoth an icy planet. Darth Vader is sending probe droids to find the Rebles and find Luke. Hmmm I wonder why... Luke investigates is attacked by a snow beast uses the force escapes leaves and almost freezes to death. Luke gets a message from Obi-Wan and is told to go to the Degobah system. Han goes out to look for Luke and eventually finds him. Han and Luke are forced spend a cold night on Hoth in the morning a search party finds Luke and takes them back to the Rebel base and puts Luke in a Bacta tank. Then the Rebeles find some Imperial walkers ready to destroy Echo Base. There is a battle and Han and Leia escape on the Mellenium Falcon. The Imperials are looking for Han and Leia. Then Darth Vader calls in 6 bounty hunters IG-88, Dengar, Zukuss and 4-LOM, Bossk and Boba Fett. Han and Leia are forced to flee to Cloud City on the planet Bespin during their visit they will meet up with an old \"Friend\" Lando Callrisean . Right as they leave we see a ship resting on an asteroid... Meanwhile Luke and R2 leave Hoth to find Yoda. They find a little creature who turns out to be Yoda. Yoda teaches Luke the ways of the force. Luke feels in the force that Han and Leia are in serious trouble so he leaves Degobah to go and save his friends. Han is put into torture to be put into Carbon Freeze. If he survives then the Empire will use the Carbon Freezeing Chamber on Luke to turn him to the dark side. It turns out that Boba Fett has also made it to Cloud City. Han survives carbon freeze then is taken with Boba Fett to visit Jabba the Hutt. Luke arrives in cloud city to find Darth Vader in his trap. Luke and Vader have a lightsaber battle while Leia Lando Chewbacca R2 and C3-P0 escape. In the end of the battle Luke gets his hand chopped off along with his fathers lightsaber. Vader says the lines \" I am your father.\" Luke is hanging on a platform over an abyss then lets go to escape the dark side. Luke almost dies because he is hanging on a pole after being sucked into an exhaust vent. Then his friends Leia and Lando save him from death.

Empire, like any other great film, has a few flaws, such as dragging on with needless information and too little of Boba Fett, but it makes up for it with fun characters (including news ones like Yoda and Fett), better SFX and that famous revelation of the truth about Darth Vader. Also, despite what some say, there is character development. For example, in the original, Luke Skywalker was an innocent teenager who hungered for action, while in Empire, he is more mature and serious. In the beginning of Empire he is a little like the Luke from the original, half way through he becomes more impatient and at the end he is emotionally confused.The film maybe a bit childish, like so many say (but everyone is entitled to their own opinion), but you must remember that the target audiences for Star Wars, as Lucus said, are children.In closing I'll just say Empire is a great film to watch while you sit down and relax and, like I said for Star Wars, is one you must see at least once.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Better than the original", "date": "2006-01-11T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1262174", "sentiment score": [0.0341, 0.354, 0.45, 0.1493, 0.0126]}, {"content": "Out with Clive Revile and in with Ian McDiarmid.

It represents absolutely everything good, fun and magical about my childhood. There's no separating it in my mind from Christmases, birthdays, summers and winters growing up. In the winter, my friends and I would build snow forts and pretend we were on Hoth (I was always Han Solo). My friends' dad built them a kick-ass tree house, and that served as the Ewok village. They also had a huge pine tree whose bottom branches were high enough to create a sort of cave underneath it, and this made a great spot to pretend we were in Yoda's home.

In my opinion, this is the best Star Wars-movie ever, alongside Revenge of the Sith.

As for the characters, they became richer and more \"human\" (the Han/Leia romance subplot is pure genius).Among all the great stuff, there are two things fans, but also \"ordinary\" people, tend to remember more fondly about this film: First of all, this is the episode that introduced Yoda, and what an entrance he makes: those expecting the wise Jedi from the prequels won't believe what they're seeing. This Yoda is an old fool who starts playing with Luke Skywalker's tools, stealing his food and even hitting R2-D2 with his stick, before getting mentally stable again and accepting to train Luke, so that the young boy can face Darth Vader who, as the title (and John Williams'magnificent Imperial March) suggests, has an essential role in this movie.But most of all, this film will remain immortal thanks to its shocking climax: unexpected, unpredictable (unless you've already seen the prequels or the Simpsons-episode where Homer spoils it) and unforgettable, it's the stuff really great movies are made of.People say the second part of a trilogy is always the trickiest to achieve; well, in this case, it was worth all the trouble: the Empire doesn't just strike back, it totally wins!", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "The Force is strong with this one...", "date": "2005-11-16T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1217677", "sentiment score": [0.0051, 0.0148, 0.0374, 0.3374, 0.6052]}, {"content": "The rebels have had their brief victory over the Imperial Forces; destroying the Death Star.

The beginning carries on from the original \"Star Wars\" film; although the Death Star has been destroyed, the Empire remains strong and the evil Darth Vader continues to hunt down the rebels on their base on the icy planet of Hoth. There is no really definite ending; the film might just as well have ended with the words, familiar from old Saturday morning serials, \"To Be Continued\"- which of course it was in \"Return of the Jedi\". In between, the mix is much the same as it was in the first \"Star Wars\"- a science-fiction adventure incorporating elements of other film genres, notably the war film but also the western, the oriental martial arts film, sword-and-sorcery type fantasy and the Robin Hood type of mediaeval adventure, all topped off with a helping of mystical religion.All the major characters from the original film make a return in this one; Obi-Wan Kenobi was killed off in a duel with Darth Vader, but returns here as a ghost. The main developments in the story are a growing romance between Han Solo and Leia and a startling revelation about Luke's origins. (I won't say what that is). In addition to Luke, Leia, Han and the rest there are two new characters, Lando Calrissian, an old but not necessarily reliable friend of Han Solo, and Yoda. Yoda is a senior member of the Jedi Knights, the mysterious brotherhood to which Obi-Wan also belonged, and the Jedi Master to whom Luke is sent to undertake training with a view to initiation into the order. The scenes between Luke and Yoda strengthen the semi-religious tone already apparent in the first film; the philosophy of the Jedi, as expounded by Yoda, seems to have much in common with Far Eastern religions such as Zen Buddhism. Given the seriousness with which these scenes were obviously intended to be treated, it struck me as unfortunate that Yoda was not a human being but rather a strange alien creature looking like a wizened garden gnome with outsize ears. It was difficult to take seriously anything said by such a bizarre-looking character, especially as Yoda, despite his supposed immense wisdom, seemed incapable of mastering the rules of English syntax, coming up with odd sentences such as \"This one a long time have I watched\".There is some good acting, particularly from Harrison Ford as Han Solo, a character who undergoes considerable development from the cynic of the first film to a man prepared to take on responsibilities and take risks for what he believes in. It is perhaps a pity that Alec Guinness's role here is rather limited, as he was easily the best actor in the original film. I am not one of those who regard the original \"Star Wars\" trilogy as great cinematic masterpieces, but there is plenty to enjoy in them if you do not take them too seriously and regard them simply as entertaining science-fiction adventures.

It is usually common for a follow-up to an original to be a let-down, but THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is not one such example. Directed by Irvin Kirschner, this new chapter in the saga doesn't just live up to its predecessor, it surpasses it--and then some. The storyline takes a darker, more heavy-handed spin as Luke, Han, Leia, and the Rebel Forces find themselves under assault from Darth Vader and the Imperial troops. As the movie progresses, we root for our heroes to prevail--only to find ourselves downcast when we come to the somewhat sad (yet hopeful) conclusion. Yet the movie is all the more magnificent for it.THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK also gives a chance to expand upon the characters' relationships with each other--to entertaining and occasionally amusing results. The give-and-take banter between Han and Leia (which, of course, turns into a romance) is hilarious and made all the more memorable by Harrison Ford's swaggering portrayal of Han and Carrie Fisher coming off as a perfect foil for his bluster. The chemistry between them is definitely a lot more lively and interesting than, say, the love sequences involving Natalie Portman and Haydn Christensen in the prequels (not to put both down, however). Mark Hamill is best known to us today as one of Hollywood's best voice actors ever, but his acting as Luke Skywalker deserves special mention. In EMPIRE, he displays an incredible range of emotion and growing pains, which helps the audience to identify with his struggle. His eventual growth from a reckless, unthinking youth to a mature, confident hero is completed full-circle in the final entry of the STAR WARS movies, RETURN OF THE JEDI, but tracing where it begins in this movie credits that.Not only are we introduced to all-new worlds such as the freezing, snow-covered ice planet Hoth to the musty swamp bog of Dagobah, we are introduced to new characters. For example, on Bespin, we meet Lando Calrissian, a charming yet shifty rogue who shares a somewhat shaky friendship with Han Solo. Billy Dee Williams conveys the character to effectiveness; the transition from traitor to ally is well handled and believable. Of course, the most memorable character in the movie is Yoda, the crotchety yet benign Jedi Master who takes it under himself to lead Skywalker down the straight and narrow path. In the prequels, we see him flex his facial expression chops through computer animation, but in this film (in addition to JEDI) we see him as a rubber puppet operated by Frank Oz. His playful yet wise nature exudes through the latex and comes across as a staple character--an astonishing triumph for a non-computer generated creation.The production values are spectacular, with unforgettably visceral action sequences highlighting every minute on screen such as the snow battle against giant dinosaur-like walkers, the daredevil chase through the asteroid field, and of course, the climactic confrontation between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader.There are lots of great moments in THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK one could go on and on about, but none so greater as--**SPOILER**--the instant where Darth Vader reveals that HE is Luke's father. I can only imagine what the impact of this emotionally charged scene must have been for audiences; of course when seeing the STAR WARS movies in chronological order, this moment may create effects different than from what audiences in 1980 (and frankly, those who have seen only the original trilogy) experienced.In short, not only is THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK one of the best entries in the STAR WARS saga, but one of the best sequels ever.In 1997, George Lucas revamped this film (along with the other two entries in the original trilogy) as a Special Edition. Most of the enhancements aren't as noticeable as in STAR WARS, but one of them is breathtaking--the expansion of Cloud City allows us to see an entire depth of dimension to the world that we haven't seen before. By contrast, the moment where we see the ice monster approach Luke (the original version has only two brief cutaway shots of this creature) doesn't amaze us as much as the former. This DVD release features a bit more tweaking, most noticeable is a new conversation between Darth Vader and the Emperor (played, in this scene, by Ian McDiarmid). Some may oppose such changes, but I liked this particular enhancement a lot. It really helps bridge the entire saga together as a whole (not to mention it makes it more consistent). Combine all that with a state-of-the-art visual remastering and sound remixing, and you have a splendid edition of THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK on your hands.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "One of the few movies to set a new standard for sequels.", "date": "2005-09-02T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1163774", "sentiment score": [0.0022, 0.0235, 0.2554, 0.6438, 0.0751]}, {"content": "After being abruptly evicted from his Death Star digs, Darth Vader seeks out the young rebel warrior responsible, Luke Skywalker. He has plans for the boy. Skywalker, meanwhile, leaves his friends in the middle of an Imperial invasion for a crash course in Jedi Knighthood amid a desolate swampworld with only a faultfinding green gnome for company. Can Luke complete his training before Darth reels him in?Well, no, actually. That's not the only way this middle installment of the \"Star Wars\" trilogy leaves things on a decidedly more discordant note than the previous, joyous \"Star Wars.\" People call this the darkest of the original three films because it is, but \"Empire\" is the only one with an adult orientation. The characters are deepened, and our investment in them from the first film challenged by events that leave them exposed to the sort of cruelties we wrongly assumed them safe from.George Lucas deserves major praise for putting such a film together, using his well-earned profits from the first film. In essence, he was literally giving the fans back some dividends for their box office proceeds. He also took chances in terms of leaving them less happy this time, knowing the emotional payoff would have to come a film later.\"Empire Strikes Back\" is thus a richer film than \"Star Wars\" emotionally, and in other ways, too. Instead of confining most of the action to the desert planet Tatoonie, the action bounces around from an ice planet to a swamp planet to the most marvelous creation of all, a city hovering high in the clouds of a gas giant, where the action culminates.Lucas adds some interesting new characters, particularly Yoda, the swamp creature Luke goes to for help, who articulates much of the philosophy and provides much of the fun in this film as voiced by Frank Oz, the guy behind (or under) Miss Piggy and later, a talented director in his own right.There's also Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian, the operator of Cloud City who provides much of the needed moral shading in the film as the stars from the previous movie are all full-blown heroes now. Williams has fun schmoozing up Leia and trying to find his feet as his slick machinations leave him in ever-hotter water.The best performance in this film is Mark Hamill's as Luke. Hamill had to work harder here than he did in \"Star Wars,\" sharing all his big scenes with a Muppet and a guy with a bucket on his head. But Hamill finds the essence of a character more interesting than the naive farmboy we saw in the first film, playing Luke as confused, fearful, impetuous, and flawed in a way that makes him more likable, rather than less so. How Hamill never hit it big after his great work here is an injustice on par with Cleavon Little's lack of work after \"Blazing Saddles.\"What else about this is great? The score by John Williams, introducing the recognizable \"Imperial March\" theme music as well as some rousing material during the final confrontation between Luke and Darth. The interaction between Vader and his subordinates is chokingly funny, in a way that only adds to the suspense and dread. The opening battle around the ice planet is marvelously intense, especially as witnessed from the cockpits of Rebel fighters taking on thickly-armored Imperial walkers.The returning cast except for Hamill doesn't seem as sharp this time, especially Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia, so charming in \"Star Wars,\" gaunt and miserable here. Much of the whole middle section of the film is draggy and woolly, like the various silly ways the Millennium Falcon escapes Imperial pursuit and the scene in the \"cave\" that goes on much longer than it should. Even Luke's scenes with Yoda become slow and tedious with multiple viewings.The enthusiasm that makes \"Empire Strikes Back\" so beloved today is understandable. It turned \"Star Wars\" from a great film into an enjoyable franchise.

Many sequels fail because they lack freshness and creativity. Lucas had the stories for 12 Episodes before even releasing Episode IV.-Yoda and Lando were the only new characters and Frank Oz and Billy Dee Williams both had firm grips on the story and their roles in the plot.-The revelation that Luke's father was actually very alive and in fact Darth Vader was one of the most anticipated but yet not surely known twists ever.-The visuals in Episode V kept par and passed Episode IV. The ice planet Hoth, the City in the Clouds, Dagobah, and the asteroid monster were all amazing eye candy in 1980.-Irvin Kershner also did a brilliant job directing, much better than Lucas himself did in any of the prequels or Episode IV. He made the original encounter with Yoda perfect. It was as not only was Luke meeting Yoda, but so were you.-And of course, John Williams served up another score of brilliance. He's the best composer to ever work in film.What The Empire Strikes Back truly does is save the Star Wars series. If this movie was some half-attempted low rent film that coasted off the success of the original like almost every other sequel out there we would not be here now talking about the prequels and the Return of the Jedi would have been some movie that topped the box-office for one weekend before falling into oblivion.

A much more personal tale, this film is really all about the journey of young Luke Skywalker. A New Hope followed Skywalker as he became involved in the rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Here the rebellion is put on the back burner. This is less the story of a grand rebellion and more the story of one young man's growth as he continues to fulfill his destiny.We pick up with the rebels in hiding on a secret base on the remote ice world of Hoth. All the familiar figures from last time around are here, including Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca and the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO. And Luke Skywalker is here as well and it is Skywalker whom Darth Vader seems most interested in finding. Last time out Vader and the Empire were simply interested in wiping out the mostly anonymous rebels. Now, Vader has taken a personal interest in young Skywalker. The movie kicks into high gear as the Empire locates the rebel base and a great battle ensues. The rebels are forced to flee their base and here our heroes go off in different directions.Guided by the spirit of former mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness in what is basically a cameo role) Luke Skywalker heads for the distant swampy planet of Dagobah where he is to be trained by the old Jedi master Yoda. Soon to be one of the most beloved characters in the series, Yoda is a 900-year old, two feet tall, green alien creature. The performances of puppeteer Frank Oz as Yoda and Mark Hamill as Skywalker are crucial here. Were the performances lacking audiences might have found it hard to believe these scenes where the young Jedi trainee converses and interacts with the rather odd little creature. But Hamill and Oz pull it off well. On Dagobah Luke (and the audience) learn much about the Force and the ways of the Jedi. In the original film the only Jedi we saw, Obi-Wan Kenobi was a rather mysterious figure. Now some light is shed on exactly who the Jedi are and what is required to become one.While Luke trains on Dagobah, Han Solo and Princess Leia are sidetracked on their journey to meet up with the rest of the rebels. Harrison Ford is terrific again playing Solo as he has the ultra-confident wiseguy role down pat. Carrie Fisher is again strong in the role of Leia, who drops some of the pretense of the last film and begins to give in to her rather obvious feelings for the swashbuckling Solo. Eventually Han and Leia make their way to Cloud City where we are introduced to another new character in the saga, Han's old friend Lando Calrissian. Han and Leia don't quite trust Lando and it soon becomes apparent that things in Cloud City are not quite what they seem. Sensing his friends are in danger Luke Skywalker leaves Dagobah to attempt to rescue them.Skywalker arrives in Cloud City to meet his destiny. Han, Leia and the rest of the characters fade into the background as the climax, much as the entire film, will be all about Luke Skywalker. Where the original Star Wars ended with an epic space battle, here everything leads up to a thrilling one-on-one showdown capped by one of the most jaw-dropping revelations ever seen in film.Some will say the ending of The Empire Strikes Back leaves the audience hanging. It is true there is not a clearly defined traditional ending as in the original film. But the ending here is powerful in its own way. It leaves you in great suspense, eagerly awaiting the inevitable conclusion to the saga. The film is not truly self-contained, it requires the knowledge of what has come before and the expectation of what will come after. It is by not going for the easy Hollywood ending that The Empire Strikes Back truly triumphs.Taken on its own merits The Empire Strikes Back can be said to even surpass the original Star Wars. The acting performances are again first-rate. Yoda is a fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable new character. In playing Lando Calrissian, Billy Dee Williams gives us someone well worth rooting for. Or against, we're not quite sure. The John Williams score, including the famed spine-chilling Imperial March, is magnificent. The visuals are dazzling, as would be expected. And most importantly we have a truly great story. The Empire Strikes Back, much more so than A New Hope, is Luke Skywalker's movie.

However as was expected by Star Wars fans, Revenge of the Sith without a doubt took the title of Darkest Star Wars movie from Empire's mantle. Given the galactic scale of tragedy in the final prequel, Empire's personal tragedy reveals itself to be a little self-absorbed. In the post-prequel Star Wars paradigm, we should be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel in the final revelations of Empire.With the issue of darkness settled, the Star Wars audience and the movie-going public should now be able to see The Empire Strikes Back for what it is. The best Star Wars movie. And not only is it a great Star Wars movie, but it is a great movie. The direction, the writing, and even the performances come together to make it a complete movie.Watching the movies that George Lucas has directed, specifically Star Wars: Episodes I-IV, you can tell he is not a student of the craft of acting. The result is that actors are left developing the emotional life of the characters on their own. Some actors are able to survive and even thrive in this environment. Harrison Ford and Alec Guinness give inspired performances in the original Star Wars that make some of the other performances in the movie appear worse than they actually were.George Lucas responsibly tapped his professor from film school, Irvin Kershner, to direct The Empire Strikes Back, and the difference is palpable. Star Wars is without a doubt the most revolutionary in terms of Special Effects of the original trilogy. But in terms of quality movie-making, editing, cinematography, etc., Emipire takes the cake. And all the while putting together great shot after great shot, he managed to pull good performances out of most the cast. Not a single one of the primaries are flat or perform an unbelievable moment. Hamill's performance is so good you actually believe for at least a few minutes that he might stand a chance against Darth Vader.But the quality of film-making and the emotional life of the characters would not have mattered, nor could they have possibly existed without brilliant writing. In Empire Lucas is at his myth-making best (Han's metaphoric descent into hell and Luke's journey into the Dark Cave are brilliant), and the screenplay by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasden is sharp, well-paced, and energetic. As a result of this three-part collaboration, you have the rough and romantic flirtations of Han Solo and Princess Leia (in which you can hear the voice of both Brackett's earlier work, The Big Sleep and El Dorado, and Kasden's later work, The Big Chill and The Accidental Tourist). Also you have Yoda-speech when it was genuinely profound in a Confucian way, before it devolved into the gimmicky and painful form it takes in the prequels.On the whole there is no denying that Star Wars: A New Hope is the most influential movie of the series, quite possibly of the last quarter of the twentieth century (although it would have to fight with Jaws for that title). And with the fall of Anakin Skywalker in Revenge of the Sith, it no longer can be called the darkest of the Star Wars saga.

I remember crying when I found out that Vader is Luke's father (Granted, I first saw this when I was six, but still). It is easily the darkest of the original trilogy - nothing good happens to any of the heroes, but plenty of bad things happen. On the plus side, the rebellion lives to fight another day, and certain relationships are enhanced, and our main protagonists characters are further developed.Some of the greatest characters in the trilogy are also introduced in this movie (some are fleshed out in the sequel) - Yoda, Boba Fett, and of course, the Emperor. The sets are great, and it features two epic battles; the Rebel defeat on Hoth at the hands (feet?) of the Imperial AT-AT walkers, and Luke's defeat and maiming at the hands of Lord Vader. The lightsaber battle and its accompanying dialog is easily the emotional climax of the movie.As always in the original trilogy, the humor is great. It is probably at its best in this movie (\"laugh it up, fuzzball!\") Seeing these movies again (I just watched the whole original trilogy for the first time since seeing Revenge of the Sith) made me realize what is really missing from the new movies - that great chemistry that the actors/actresses had. For all the technical and visual flair of the new flicks, you just don't have the kind of relationships like you had in the old movies - Han and Chewy, Han and Leia, Luke and Leia, R2 and 3PO, Luke and Vader, Luke and Yoda, Yoda and Ben, Luke and Ben...I could go one forever. That human element makes up for any \"shortcomings\" the old movies had visually (although I would contend that the use of models helps these movies stand the test of time - the re-release looks AMAZING) and allows the audience to connect on an emotional level much deeper than with the new trilogy.

The character of Lando was in interesting and often overlooked element of this film. When we first meet him we think he is Han's friend and Billy Dee Williams does a great job of concealing his intentions before handing him over to the Empire. Of course Lando was in a bad spot, if Darth Vader told you to do something, would you say no? Most people contend that this is the best \"Star Wars\" film, its debatable. The original is always going to be the first one that comes to people's minds when thinking of the whole series. However, if Empire is number 2, its a close number 2.

Giving scripting credits to Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasden, as well as directing to Irvin Kershner, Lucas made his smartest ever decision and as a result was able to release the finest film of the trilogy by a mile. Considerably darker and more mature than it's predecessor, \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is a masterpiece of modern film. It is an intense, powerful, entertaining film with the ultimate cinema twist and with a script worthy of it's potential.After the events of the first film, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Han Solo (Harrison Ford) are now members of the rebel alliance. Hidden on a frozen planet, the rebels hide from the domineering glow of the Empire. All is not well however as the evil Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones) is on his way to find them.Easily the best of the trilogy, \"The Empire Strikes Back\" has so much going for it. A wonderful plot, an equally good script with some brilliant lines (even actor Harrison Ford joining in with a line or two of his own) and special effects to match, this film is a glowing example of why people love the trilogy so much.Since George Lucas passed on the major responsibilities for this film, we are given a more professional, well made film for our attention and Lucas's vision is better off for it. With it's recent remastering, it is also the only film in the trilogy to not be damaged by Lucas' tampering. Extra images are added, graphics are honed, but nothing major is changed. As a result the film appears to us to be no different from it's original self.Darker and more mature as well, this sequel is better than the original \"Star Wars\" because it isn't so black and white. Presenting the evil Darth Vader as a more balanced individual, we don't quite have the confused Vader of the final chapter, but we are beginning to get signs that he isn't quite as we expected.This second part also gives us the finest performance ever by one of the universes most important characters. Still a rubber puppet with bendy ears, Jedi Master Yoda is introduced in this film as a creature of wit and intelligence. Voiced by Frank Oz, Yoda is brilliant because of his lines. Legendarily possessing of an obsession for splitting sentences up and rehashing them together, Yoda very often speaks normally throughout this film. Occasionally demonstrating his penchant for bad English, he does make a few minor errors, but ultimately it is up to the later scripts of George Lucas to corrupt Yoda's style and turn this wonderful character into an annoying figure of fun.There's no real way to fault \"The Empire Strikes Back\". The finest part of the original trilogy, this film is amazing because it is professionally done. Nobody would ever deny that George Lucas did something wonderful when he thought up \"Star Wars\", but unfortunately for a lot of the films, Lucas always insisted on too much control. A dire writer of scripts, Lucas can destroy his films by making them infuriating to watch.

The three are ultimately reunited, but with terrible consequences ...The sequel to George Lucas' Star Wars is that extremely rare thing - a sequel that is better than the original movie. Having created the fantastic universe and the cast of comic-book heroes in the first film, this movie is free to develop the characters, drama, humour and wildly imaginative worlds. It has a truly fantastic script (by Lawrence Kasdan and veteran screenwriter Leigh Brackett, from a story by Lucas) with an almost unique structure - there's no beginning, no ending and the story splits in two at the end of the third reel and then reunifies for the last two reels. It also redefines the use of special effects again, expanding on the eye-popping visuals of Star Wars with a breathtaking variety of dazzling shots. The opening battle sequence on Hoth (shot in Finse in Norway) is fabulous, with walking robot monsters pounding across glaciers to the strains of John Williams cracking score (his Imperial March theme is perhaps the most memorable of all his Star Wars music). The intimate scenes of Luke's Jedi training are just wonderful - Yoda is perfectly realised by puppeteer Oz - and the quasi-philosophy of the Force, brilliantly captured in a scene where Yoda rescues Luke's ship from the swamps, is profoundly moving. Equally stunning is the characterisation of Darth Vader, arguably the greatest screen villain of all time (and with the biggest, baddest killer spaceship ever); there is a fantastic moment where he uses his mind-control powers to invisibly throttle an incompetent general whilst simultaneously barking orders to another !! His unforgettable voice, supplied by the incomparable (and shockingly uncredited) Jones is one of the movie's great assets.

The apprentice and the droid leave Yoda as Obi-Wan tells the green creature that he is their only hope; while Yoda says that there's another one with the same gift as Luke.Han Solo, Leia, Chewbacca and C-3PO arrived at Cloud City where they meet Lando Calrissen (Billy Dee Williams), a mercenary turned peace adviser of the planet and friend to Han, where they go inside to relax, until 3PO has been abducted and Darth Vader arrives in the waiting room, capturing Luke's friends and taking them hostage.

The original film introduced something brand new to the movie scene back in the 70's but aside from being an instant classic and being very original it had some problems. The characters were very badly drawn up making them nothing more than card board cutt-outs and in the end that felt very unfulfilled. This problem is rectified in Empire Strikes Back. Its very obvious that George Lucas has had more fun writing the characters in the second movie. He begins to give them edge and more depth. The story in the second film is also far more fulfilling than that in the original and the twitch at the end is still one of the most interesting and well-thought-out twitches in movie history.The acting has also improved loads since the first film mostly due to the fact that the characters are better defined. Especially Mark Hamill shines in this film and if you compare him to the character of Anakin, played by Hayden Christensen, in Episode II you begin to see some similarities. They are both quite hot tempered and impatient and you actually see where George Lucas was going. Also Harrison Ford begins to show his real talents in this film. There are a few new characters in the film like Lando Calrissian, played by Billy Dee Williams, and Yoda, voice acted by Frank Oz, and they are both good adds to the cast list.The effects have of course improved and they serve to make the film even more visually interesting than the first film.

Make a sequel that's bigger and better than the original. Not only is The Empire Strikes Back better than A New Hope, but it completely blows it out of the water. The first Star Wars film started it all and paved the way for the second installment, but essentially it was a fairly bland and simple space adventure with great special effects. Return of the Jedi, which followed The Empire Strikes Back, was also a weaker film. Empire is clearly the best film of the original trilogy. So much in fact it transcends the other films and it's easy to appreciate the film out of the context of the Star Wars universe. While the first film was too cartoonish and the third too unbalance, the second hit exactly the right note. The story picks up several years after A New Hope. The Death Star is destroyed and the rebels are hiding at their base on the ice planet of Hoth. The Empire is hot on their trail with a zealous Darth Vader combing the galaxy in search of them. From the very start of the movie it's one big giant chase. Unlike the other two films, Empire gets the big battle out of the way in the beginning so that it can slowly build down until the climax. It's a reversal of the typical adventure film arc and it works perfectly. In Empire all of the characters are fleshed out and become as real people, whereas in A New Hope they just served the storyline. There's the classic Greek mythology pathos going on with the battle between good and evil. There are also many shades of gray in the film, as the characters drift in out and of good and evil, and face difficult decisions. Out of the entire trilogy the middle film also features the most impressive and elaborate sets. Over the course of two hours we are taken into four different worlds, the ice planet Hoth, the swamp world of Dagobah, an asteroid field in space, and Cloud City. All four locales are entirely impressive. The lighting is another key factor in the film's vibrant look. Lighting becomes the most flamboyant towards the end of the film during the dusk looking scenes at Cloud City. Finally something must be said of the epic lightsaber duel between Luke and Vader that makes up the film's climax. It's the best duel in any of the films. Storywise there's a lot on the line, but it's choreographed and filmed so well it wouldn't matter how it ties into the story. It's the dirtiest and grungiest of all the duels. It's nice to actually see the physical effects of fighting for a change. In the other films the characters are pretty much stoic but here we get to see Luke grow out of breath, tire, bleed, and have his cloths torn. He stumbles around, expresses emotion, and even gets a few nice on-uppers on Vader when he's underestimated. Ultimately it's a wonderful way to finish a great film.

He manages to escape with the help of the Force and his light sabre, but he is still stuck in the blizzard, and before going unconscious and being rescued by Han Solo (Harrison Ford), he sees a vision of Ben (Obi-Wan) Kenobi (Sir Alec Guinness) telling him to go to the Degobah system and find Jedi master Yoda. So after a quick battle between the Rebels and the Empire, Luke, with R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) heads to this planet, and eventually he finds Yoda (a Muppet style creature voiced and performed by Muppet member Frank Oz, aka Miss Piggy and Fozzie Bear), and they start training. Meanwhile, Han, Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) are in the Millennium Falcon, pursued by the Empire (because of a tracking device), and hide for a while in what they thought was the inside of a near meteor, but it was in fact the belly of a giant worm alien. When they do get out, they head for their destination to fix the ship, the planet Bespin, where they are greeted by Han's old shifty gambler friend (and original Millennium Falcon owner), Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). But what they didn't know is that Darth Vader (acted by David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones) and the stormtroopers arrived before them, and they are the bait of Vader's trap to get Luke, who he has become obsessed with finding. As a prize for finding them, Han Solo is frozen in carbonate and (when confirmed he is alive) is give to bounty hunter Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch) to be delivered to crime lord Jabba the Hutt (who you saw in the first film). Eventually, Luke does land on the planet, and he and Darth have a long and exciting light sabre fight, while Leih's gang escape in the Millennium Falcon.

None of the good guys win in this second chapter of the 3 film saga that makes up the Original Star Wars Trilogy, the film acts as a dark bridge from the light, fun action of A New Hope to the concluding Return of the Jedi. Even the last scene of this film reeks of \"To Be Continued,\" without actually saying it. The rebel forces, after blowing up the Death Star, are forced to hide out on a the ice planet Hoth. Darth Vader tracks them down, and our heroes are forced to flee. Han and Leia go one way, Luke has to find the Jedi Master Yoda on his secluded swamp planet (voice of Frank Oz). Yoda may be the most lifelike character in \"Empire,\" and that's a pretty good compliment to a Muppet. We see Luke fail to master his Jedi powers, and we see him leave in haste to try to save Han and Leia who walk into a trap while visiting Han's old card playing friend, Lando Carisian (Billy Dee Williams). How Luke tries to save his friends is unimportant, as the single most shocking movie revelation comes during the final duel of the movie between Luke and Darth Vader. Unsuspecting movie goers have been blindsided by this scene for decades now. The tone, set by director Irvin Kershner, is darker and more serious, lends an adult feel to what is basically a kid's movie. The special effects are again top-notch, especially in the beautiful Cloud City and the fantastic looking asteroid field chase.

It also introduces us to the legendary Yoda and a new key player in Lando Calrissian and has some breath taking special effects.

Put me in the camp of those who feel the added digital effects are a desecration; I want to see the movies the way they were released originally. I simply tried to ignore the alterations and was successful for the most part. It certainly is nice to see these films in widescreen, with outstanding picture and sound quality.I felt the same way after seeing Star Wars again that I have since 1977: it is the greatest achievement in the history of movies. To my surprise, however, when I watched Empire the next night, I was disappointed. It is a very well-directed, well-polished movie, but to my mind, it lacks the visual, graphic brilliance that helped make the original so extraordinary. Star Wars and American Graffiti, the two masterpieces George Lucas directed in his youth, both have an incredible, unmatched look. Lucas didn't move the camera much, but he made up for it with the amazing, jukebox-like style of what he photographed with it. Empire lacks that quality.***SPOIILERS AHEAD*** Star Wars was really a perfect story that ended with what is still the greatest action sequence ever (the Death Star battle) followed by the ultimate coda (the Throne Room scene). Watching Empire right afterward was a little jarring. Suddenly, without warning, we learn that despite destroying \"the ultimate power\" in the universe, the rebels have gained no advantage, and they're on the run, stuck hiding on a miserable little ice planet with a single, tiny base. Wouldn't more fighters, more systems have joined the Alliance after the destruction of the Death Star? How did the rebels go from ultimate victory to being nearly crushed so quickly?Another major shock to me -- and probably the biggest weakness of Empire -- was the change in the relationships of the three main characters. In Star Wars, from the moment Luke first saw Leia, he was in love with her (\"who is she? she's beautiful\") -- so much so that he stood dumbstruck when he first entered her cell on the Death Star. There were strong hints that Leia reciprocated -- she kissed him (half on the cheek, half on the lips) twice, looked very nervous when he seemed dead in the final battle, and certainly Luke was in puppy-love with her the entire film. Now, all of a sudden, in Empire, Luke and Leia are on-screen together for about three minutes total, and there is no hint of Luke's love for her. Without explanation, now it's all about Han and Leia, who despite no hint of attraction in Star Wars are suddenly are madly in love. I suspect there are three main reasons for this:1. Unlike Fisher and Hamill, Harrison Ford was not signed up for sequels. He only agreed to come back on condition that his character was developed from the wisecracking, cynical sidekick into the wisecracking, cynical, romantic hero lead. This gave his career a great boost, but in my opinion totally undercut the character of Luke Skywalker, who should have been the emotional focus of the movie (as he was in Star Wars).2. Mark Hamill's disfiguring car accident in December 1976 (after completion of principal photography on Star Wars) made it easier to turn his character into a monk-like, asexual person (the process that started in Empire and finished in Jedi). In Star Wars Hamill was a handsome, though callow, screen presence. But after the accident (despite plastic surgery), he just didn't look good. It hampered his performance and basically destroyed his capacity to play a romantic lead.3. To the extent that Lucas planned to have Leia be Luke's sister (a terrible decision that I suspect was not made until after the release of Empire), they obviously could not be romantically involved. However, their \"incestuous\" love for each other is all over Star Wars. I think the decision to make Leia and Luke siblings only came after the radical character revisions in Empire eliminated any romantic feelings between Luke and Leia and turned Luke into a boring monk.Indeed, Empire's greatest weakness is that it's too heavy. The \"dark side of the force\" was only briefly discussed in Star Wars, but here it's played up to an extent that the concept just can't support. Yoda says that \"fear, anger, hatred\" lead to the dark side, but how exactly is a human being supposed to avoid these emotions? The Force was fleshed out just the right amount (i.e., not too much) in Star Wars, but here it is revealed not to make a whole lot of sense. There's way too much \"good vs. evil\" that's no longer presented in a fun style in Empire. It's taken too seriously, which reminds me of the Lord of the Rings movies -- not a good thing.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "a revised impression", "date": "2004-12-01T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0970873", "sentiment score": [0.0455, 0.3867, 0.4092, 0.1461, 0.0125]}, {"content": "\"The Force is with you, young Skywalker, but you are not a Jedi yet.\" Everything the middle section of a trilogy should be: quirky, incomplete, downbeat.

Luke visits swamp planet Dagobar to learn more about the Force from Yoda, a master of garbled syntax. Much more enjoyable are the attempts by Han, Leia and the rest to escape the Imperial star fleet.

But, I can imagine, they were also wondering if it would be as good as Star Wars. No, it's not. It's much better. There's more action, the characters become richer and we are introduced to new ones. Thankfully, Lucas backed down in directing and/or writing the film. Considered as the best film among the Trilogy, The Empire Strikes Back starts with the whole gang staying at a Rebel base in the ice planet of Hoth. After almost getting mauled by a Wampa Beast, Luke gets a message from Obi-Wan Kenobi to go to the Planet of Dagobah and look for a Jedi Master named Yoda. The Imperial Army arrives and tries to destroy the base, but the Rebels have already escaped, with Luke accompanied by R2-D2 goes to Dagobah. The Battle of Hoth is easily my favorite action scene in the whole Trilogy.While Han, Leia and Chewbacca are hiding from the Imperial army that's chasing them, Luke meets the 800 year-old Jedi Master Yoda. Full of wisdom and a funny way of talking, Yoda trains Luke to be a real Jedi and teaches him the ways of a Jedi. Almost nothing happens in the middle of the film, except for great character development and lots of intelligent dialogue. It manages to keep us interested and excited without having too many action scenes. We get to know more about all the characters, including the villains and new characters that we are introduced to.We then meet Lando Calrissian who lives in Bespin, a city that floats among the clouds. Lucas hardly touched this masterpiece, but he still added some more striking visuals, most of which aren't unnecessary. More windows are added to the buildings in Bespin, adding lot more light and life to the settings. The visuals added aren't a bother anymore, and for once probably made a scene look better. Han and Leia don't trust Lando, to which we soon find out that they were right about their feelings toward him. Luke forsees that they're in trouble and goes to make sure that they're all right. As Han Solo is about to be frozen, Leia finally admits to Han that she loves her. To which Han replies with, \"I know.\" It's an incredibly touching and emotional scene, where things are just about to get worse.As Luke arrives at Bespin, he encounters Darth Vader, to which father and son fight. Quite possibly the best Lightsaber fight in all the Star Wars films, the scene is filled with so much emotion and a shocking revelation. Luke sacrifices his own life rather than join the dark side, and is saved by Leia and Chewbacca, along with Lando, after much threats from Chewy. The film ends on such a downbeat note, keeping a cliffhanger for the final movie in the Trilogy. The characters have yet to face another adventure, and learn more from each other as the Imperial is yet to be beaten and Solo to be rescued. It's not a happy ending, or should I say, a beginning for the characters as what the future holds from them is yet to be known. It shouldn't be a suprrise from anyone that The Empire Strikes Back is considered by many as the best of the Trilogy, because the film is a great stepping-stone for the characters we've grown to love in the first film and introduces us to new ones that we easily grow to love and care for. That's what makes Star Wars a great Trilogy in the first place: it's the characters we remember.

This is the film in which a lot of key character relationships are forged in earnest. It also includes, in my opinion, the best light sabre sequences: Alec Guiness may be a super actor, but he's not desperately nimble, whilst we do not have the same confidence in Luke as we do in Return of the Jedi.Some people these days are dazzled by the modern films, but believe you me, the old ones are better.

(We'll have to see what George Lucas comes up with for \"Revenge of the Sith.\") There are no easy victories here; in fact, the movie ends with pretty much all of the main characters (even, to an extent, Darth Vader) in defeat. And for the benefit of those who have never seen it, I won't reveal the jaw-dropping plot twist near the end--suffice to say that I vividly remember hearing an opening-day audience (in 1980) of 1,000 moviegoers gasp as this plot turn was revealed. At the same time, the movie's sense of wonder and fantasy keeps \"Empire\" from turning grim.It's probably no accident that of the original trilogy, \"Empire\" has been subjected to the fewest changes (both for the \"Special Edition\" theatrical release in '97 and the DVD). Lucas must have recognized that this was artistically the most accomplished of the three and therefore \"needed\" little tinkering. We get a few more shots of the snow beast in its ice cave, a slightly expanded version of the dialogue between Vader and the Emperor (now with Ian McDiarmid's face and voice) and a different voice for bounty hunter Boba Fett's two or three lines of dialogue. That's about it, aside from some minor (and helpful) sprucing up of the special effects and a more prominent place for John Williams' music in the sound mix (also an improvement--the music often came across too faintly in the original release).

It still has some of the best action sequences around and numerous video games have lifted elements of it for combat and light saber duels. The CGI enhancements added in the 90's are less obvious and less intrusive than those in Star Wars, and really add or subtract little if anything.

While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, the 'Star Wars' trilogy filled our imaginations like no other movies before them. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.It is fruitless trying to argue 'which is best' in a trilogy, because the first one, in this case 'Star Wars', starts it all and has to be the 'father'. However, an argument can be made that 'The Empire Strikes Back' (now on DVD called Episode V) is overall a better-made movie which has more excitement, and grabs your imagination,than the other two original installments (now called parts IV and VI). The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb.

Not the same formulaStudios love taking the same premise and characters and generating cash in a repeatable fashion without having to do much creative work. If they make $60 million on a movie about a talking dog, you can bet they'll try to make $50 to $60 million again with the exact same storyline and characters.The original Stars Wars was a happy-go-lucky coming of age story where the good guys win. Even at 8 years old in 1980 I expected to see the same formula when I went to the drive-in to watch ESB. Instead, were presented with the best sequel of all time. Every sequel knows that if you wish to really establish your franchise in the second film you need to create the magic that ESB presents. NOTE: Star Trek 2: The Wrath of Kahn is very close is establishing a franchise with a sequel.9. A change in toneThe first film was happy and carefree with no sense of real tension or drama (who didn't believe Luke would take out the Death Star?). The second film is dark and one inescapable dead end after another (Luke stuck in the snow, Luke's X-Wing stuck in the water, Han Solo in the carbon chamber, Luke on the edge, etc.).8. Consistent motivation of charactersThis movie is about friendship and sacrifice. Every major character in this movie from Luke to Darth Vader is used to communicate this message. Whether it's Luke not willing to sacrifice his friends or Vader manipulating Luke's weakness; his loyalty to his friends ... the message is always about friendship and sacrifice for those that we care for.A great movie recently had a character (Jesus) say \"You are my friends. And there is no greater love than for a man to lay down his life for his friends.\"7. HumorIn a film with lots of drama, they managed to put lots of decent jokes that really balanced out the tension. Seeing Han Solo, who's always acting like he's in control, lose control when the Falcon won't jump to lightspeed is classic. Even C-3PO has moments of great humor (unlike in the new films).6. Action SequencesThis movie has some of the greatest action sequences ever; the Astroid sequence being the best. There are many great moments to mention, but my #2 action moment all-time behind the opening to X-Men 2 is when they are in the Falcon being chased by Star Destroyers and Han Solo manages to nearly cause two destroyers to collide; pure joy.5. RomanceThe romantic tension between Leia and Han Solo is quite obvious. I can't think of many moments of cinema more heartfelt than when Han Solo is being lowered into the carbon chamber.4. CliffhangerWill they save Han Solo? Will Luke join the dark side? Will the Rebels prevail? So many good questions. I can remember distinctly the time between ESB and \"Return of the Jedi\" as being too long.3. Human StoryIn a universe of ships, lasers and people in strange gear ... what stands out most is the human element of ESB. You could take this same story and put it in the 16th century or even as a drama set in modern times and it would translate well.2. MusicThe Stars Wars theme was already well established, but Yoda's Theme and the Imperial March are songs that will last maybe even longer than the film itself. This is John William's best work ever other than for JFK in my opinion. The music in this film creates a visual and audible masterpiece like nothing other I've ever seen.1. Greatest plot twist in movie historyFour words ... \"I am your father\". I mean, does it get any more intense? Luke finds out the person he hates most, the one thing that he would love to rid the galaxy of most is his own father.

(I know that episode III is still to come out but i dunno...) My own theory for the success of The Empire Strikes Back is that at the time of it's release audiences believed it would be more of the same as the first film but bigger and better, what they got also was a great storyline, developing characters both good and bad, blazing action sequences and John Williams Empire/Darth Vader score that was to return in the next movie.My personal favourite character in this episode has to be Darth Vader. Alfred Hitchcock once said if you make a thriller or suspense drama and there are bad guys in your story they HAVE to be interesting and dangerous, in Vader's case his introduction on his star destroyer when we first see him standing with his back to us gazing out at the empire's fleet of cruisers, you hear his heavy breathing, the film is saying to us 'No introduction necessary!' After that he starts murdering commanders who fail to catch the rebels in the Millennium Falcon with a wit that is darker than his cape, i also loved the part where he has an audience with the emperor, that scene is dripping with evil, Vader perched on a podium while a huge hologram of the emperor beams over him and they plot to lure Luke Skywalker to the Dark Side, this scene also suggests that Vader has purpose for wanting Skywalker to live, as we later find out.The memorable duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker is one of the most defining moments of the trilogy. I remember seeing this film on it's special Edition re-release in the Glasgow Odeon in 1997, when Vader states 'The force is with you young Skywalker...but you are not a Jedi yet.' Luke climbs those stairs to face his nemesis, the audience just shut up.What I'm saying is THIS moment is the fight the fans were all waiting for and the outcome was so surprising and cliffhanging that people could not believe that a space fantasy film had come to such a conclusion of uncertainty for the heroic rebels.The Empire Strikes Back is not only the best star wars film but quite possibly one of the greatest films ever made in over a hundred years of cinema history.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "The best Star Wars film ever made.", "date": "2004-08-10T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0175447", "sentiment score": [0.0142, 0.0459, 0.1141, 0.4556, 0.3702]}, {"content": "This movie was a work of art as was the trilogy.

Because of this deep love of cinema, most GenXers have seen most movies released between 1975 and today (by most, I mean roughly 80% of mainstream Hollywood releases).We are also called the Star Wars generation - A title which I prefer. Why the Star Wars Generation? Probably because pop culture was so dominated (and still is to a degree) by the original Star Wars trilogy in the form of toys, games, video sets, etc., that it permeated every fabric of our American society. There is nary an individual who doesn't know Star Wars quotes such as Vader's famous \"Luke....I am your father\", especially after being so brilliantly delivered by the late Chris Farley.But, enough with the GenX rhetoric and on to why Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is a true cinematic masterpiece.Empire (as I will now refer to it) set a bold standard for movie making. Instead of it being full of cheesy SciFi stereotypes, the story is bold and dark, lending to the feeling that it is a quality piece of cinema and not typical SciFi crap. You empathize with the characters...you can feel their pain. Unlike Star Wars and Jedi, there is substance here. There are no F@#*$n' Ewoks and a very minimal amount of R2D2 and C3PO. We meet Yoda, but find his wisdom and seriously transcends the occasional silly scene.The environments of Hoth, Degobah and Cloud City are all magnificent but never \"fluffy\".

Movies like Aliens, X-men 2 and Bride of Frankenstein improved their already great predecessors (Many would add Terminator 2, but I won't, because I prefer small budget action-cyber-thrillers to big-budget bonanzas). The greatest sequel (I haven't seen Godfather II and I do not count Return of the King as a sequel) of all time is none other than the Empire Strikes Back.As Star Wars was just an amusing little adventure flick with one-dimensional characters and a simple story, however well made and funny, ESB is a lot deeper in comparison. The characters have real emotions now and the universe is a lot more dangerous place than before. Just look at the Luke in the first film, who is sadder for the death of Ben, who he knew only two days, than he is after his aunt and uncle, who have raised him as their own son, die. Now, compare him to the Luke in the sequel, and his despair as Vader tells him his secret in the very famous scene. It's a shame Mark Hamill's career went only downhill from here, because he could've done some great \"serious\" acting (Oh, come on. He's playing the Trickster as Harrison Ford makes billions with each of his movies).Fortunately, the humor has survived from the original film. Chewie, C3PO and Han vs. Leia tongue lashings still create giggles, but the funniest character is of course Jedi Master Yoda. It's brilliant how they could make a demented old muppet, who can't speak sentences with the right word order, a respectable icon of wisdom.Although the humor, the story is a lot darker than in the previous film. Deception, death and war are constantly present, and come together in one of the best climaxes I've ever seen.The Empire Strikes Back has almost everything that one could wish for; strange creatures, romance, humor, darkness (not the band you twit!) and epic fights both in space and on the ground.

Even Vader himself seems to become more soulful here and not just a giant hulking half maimed machine man tyrant.Easily the best of the old trilogy.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Wheel in the sky keeps on turnin'", "date": "2004-04-09T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0175438", "sentiment score": [0.0016, 0.0151, 0.2196, 0.6798, 0.0839]}, {"content": "Proved that Star Wars was not a fluke - and even improved on it and expanding an already amazing universe. it was this movie that made Darth Vader the ultimate villain/movie icon (or fallen hero?), this movie that defined the force (something which many other films have tried to copy) this movie that had a main character (who was completely believable & watchable) who moved us with the magic of the force - yet was a puppet; this movie that showed us the most epic duel/showdown/cliffhanger to date; this movie that showed that Harrison Ford was a movie star - and this movie that made us all want to fly the Millennium Falcon ( the first movie spaceship to really fly), fight with a light saber and be a bounty hunter!And it still amazes me today!

Granted, the original pioneered an endless saga of imitators and somewhat imaginative knock-offs, and is still one of the greatest films ever made, but \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is a tiny inch ahead in the race.It is the dark middle chapter in an almost perfect trilogy, crammed full with imagination and special effects. It is simply one of the most visionary movies of all time, which is rare for a sequel -- any sequel -- especially in the case of a sci-fi film. Just take a look at \"Predator 2\" for an example of an idea running out of steam, or a director who cannot cope with his script.The film generally picks up where the last left off: Luke (Mark Hamill) saved the day by blowing up the Death Star, the heroes were awarded with medals by the princess (Carrie Fisher), and peace was temporarily restored. But Darth Vader (voice of James Earl Jones) is still alive, and the Emperor's fury grows stronger as Luke begins his Jedi training under the help of Yoda. Meanwhile, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Leia flee to Cloud City to escape an attack from the empire, where they are taken under the wing of Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), an old pal of Han's who is secretly working for Vader, somewhat against his own will.The movie is strong in its morals and Biblical metaphors, just as the original. Luke is the savior, Calrissian could be considered the equivalent of Judas, Han Solo is one of Luke's good disciples and Vader represents pure evil. And of course, there's the truly iconic line, \"I am your father,\" that is relevant to the devil, who -- according to the scriptures -- was an angel before being cast into the bowels of hell and becoming Lucifer.\nLucas admittedly used these various metaphors to strike a nerve in the subconscious of his viewers. Like all good fables, of fantasy or reality, \"Star Wars\" is a trilogy that relates to just about everyone, in one form or another, and is -- at its roots -- a story we are all very familiar with. It is the ever-familiar notion of good-vs. -evil at its core that helps propel these movies into the hearts of many. Yes, \"Star Wars\" is the quintessential nerd's film, engulfed in an entirely different dimension, but the film's bad rap for this is undeserved -- it's still a wonderful story, and you don't have to be a die-hard fan to appreciate its fine points (and it has many).One of the most popular legends (and misconceptions) regarding the \"Star Wars\" phenomenon is that George Lucas helmed the entire Star Wars trilogy, when in fact he only directed the first and wrote the screenplay for all three combined. \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is directed by Irvin Kirshner, who also delivered us the disappointing \"RoboCop 2.\" How could one sequel be so great, and the other so bad? Simple: Kirshner's darkness in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" had a point, and a high value. In \"RoboCop 2,\" it was just excessive and silly, not to mention totally unnecessary. What Paul Verhoeven was able to do with the original \"RoboCop\" was something not many films can accomplish, and Kirshner tried to add on to this with a darker narrative, which only ended in a frustratingly empty motion picture.\"The Empire Strikes Back\" has a point amidst the action, and is the most important of all three \"Star Wars\" movies. It has the famous introduction of the creature Yoda, who sits tucked away in his hut on a swamp planet, at first startling Luke with his strange features, and then with his subtle wisdom. It is Yoda who trains Luke in the ways of the Jedi, and eventually leads him towards his destination: The showdown with Vader, when the infamous secret is finally revealed.The movie is expertly crafted, both in terms of a a narrative and literal context. From beginning to end it is darker, fiercer and more powerful than the original film, which is not an easy feat. All trilogies have their dark areas, and this is usually the middle chapter (\"Back to the Future Part II\" is a good example), yet in \"The Empire Strikes Back\" the darkness seems very appropriate given the material. It is a film that dwells long and hard on betrayal, murder, revenge, and unrecoverable mistakes. By the end of the movie, we know what Luke is feeling: There is still much to be done, despite an overwhelming emotional downpour of attachment and confusion. For us, as an audience, we know everything must come to an end within the next installment. For Luke, it could be an eternity of struggle. But we all know there will be an end to the epic saga, and we have always known this, ever since we first caught a glimpse of a younger, more innocent Luke working for his uncle on that deserted planet, so many years ago, when he could only dream of having adventures in other galaxies far, far away...5/5 stars.John Ulmer", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 36, "votes": 47}, "heading": "The best \"Star Wars\" film ever made.", "date": "2004-04-03T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0175434", "sentiment score": [0.0045, 0.0595, 0.3524, 0.5406, 0.043]}, {"content": "***Potential Spoiler*** Simply put, if you haven't seen it (I feel for you), wait until Luke finally confronts Vader near the end.

The film has it's one or two flaws, but it does develop the story and characters in surprisingly dark ways. This has to be the bleakest and most nihilistic \"Star Wars\" film so far.Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and his rag-tag group of rebels are now on the run from the Empire, hiding out in the icy planet of Hoth. After they are routed by Imperial forces, the group split. Luke heads off to swamp planet Degobah to seek out Jedi Master Yoda (Frank Oz), who will instruct him further in the ways of the Force. Meanwhile aboard the Millenium Falcon, his friends Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) are hunted relentlessly hunted down by Darth Vader (David Prowse, voiced by James Earl Jones), intent on using them to locate Skywalker...The scriptwork and acting hits a peak in this film. Darth Vader comes into his own here. Given a much more commanding role, and willfully choking to death incompetent underlings, he is more of a threatening and sinister presence. And yet you begin to see hints of the inner conflict behind the steely black mask, culminating in his now infamous revelation to Luke at the end of the film.Further developed here are Han and Leia, as the story gives them a romantic attraction. Initially it feels unlikely, a hardened but nevertheless proper Leia falling for a rogue like Solo but Fisher and Ford work well to make the romance touching and believable without going over the top.Mark Hamill is on fine form as Luke Skywalker. The young Jedi-to-be is really put through the wringer here, and Hamill carries it off well. However the droids C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) have their dramatic importance (but not their screen time) seriously reduced, and as a result become more of a distraction than an amusement.Of the new characters, Billy Dee Williams is convincingly ambiguous as Lando, an old friend of Solo whose motives are initially suspect. But best of all is Frank Oz as the benevolent Yoda, his gentle voice and memorably unique use of language conveying power and sage wisdom.Some great settings here. There is the above-mentioned Hoth and Degobah, but also Cloud City, whose eerie inner chambers and corridors (combined with John William's haunting score) set the scene for the finale.

How do you follow up an act that was so well received and set the standard so high? There is a such thing as warming up an audience. It's a totally different matter when you blow them away. In these days, when it is customary to believe that sequels have no chance to equal their predecessor, all one has to do is point to 'Empire Strikes Back' to reject that notion.The movie is so elegantly made and so vibrant in its creativity, it somehow finds a way to surpass its predecessor. 'Star Wars' opens its universe but 'Empire Strikes Back' enriches it. Yoda makes his appearance into popular culture. Luke discovers the truth of his family. And each character completes an arc that they merely began in the first movie. If 'Star Wars' is a movie about innocence, the naive farmer boy flying off to save the galaxy, then 'Empire Strikes Back' is a movie about how that innocence was lost. When happens when the party is over?It is well known that Mark Hamill was in a car accident before the filming of the sequel. The accident did extensive damage to his face, and many worried that he could not act the part of Luke Skywalker anymore. The result was that he created a far more mature version of Skywalker for the better of the franchise. He portrays Skywalker as a veteran of the rebellion, aged through fighting and no longer a naive boy.The making of 'Empire Strikes Back' was approached with artistry, which made it a much darker film than its predecessor. Not everyone appreciated the change, but no one could deny that it was a masterpiece, very dark and yet very human in its story telling. The scene I remember most comes near the end, when Darth Vader is staring out the window of his ship watching victory come within his grasp only to slip past him again.\nThe audience cannot see any facial expressions because of his mask, but the pain of his loss is very perceptible. He is a worn soldier, scarred by evil but very desperate for what he wants. It is possible to pity him, which makes the complications of the story that much more compelling. I did not always love this movie. But that has changed.

I believe this because it has great thrills and tension, and some very funny and humorous moments. But best of all, this part of the Star Wars epic continues on the fantasy that I loved to escape as a child, and I still can now as an adult.The battle to save the galaxy from the evil Empire rages on as Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia and Chewbacca face attack by the Imperial forces While Han and Leia escape, Luke sets off to Dagobah in search of Jedi Master, Yoda. Only with the Jedi Master's help will Luke survive when the dark side of the force beckons him into a life or death duel with the fearsome Darth Vader.The screenplay to this part in the Star Wars puzzle was very good indeed. It was written by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan. The best aspect of the screenplay has to be the raw emotion that it presents. Not many Sci-fi movies can boast having this in their story, but ESB has.It does so through, the relationship of Luke and Yoda, Han and Leia's and through Luke and Darth Vader's confrontation. Yet the story also encapsulates some very funny humour, between Han Solo and Princess Leia, and R2D2 and C3PO. These characters are very funny for the best part of the film. Yet the battle between the Good and Dark sides of the force, continues to make the story very entertaining. Both Leigh and Lawrence do justice to the story that Lucas had created for ESB.Although George Lucas was only the executive producer of ESB, you can still fill the Lucas presence on the film. Director of ESB was a man by the name of Irvin Kershener. I have learnt that this film helped to keep his career on track. I love the way that Irvin made this movie seem like such a thrilling joyride, an area that a fan like me, believes all these films need to be successful. He also allowed us to see very closely what each individual battle was like and gave insight into most confrontations or relationships. It was a very balanced and professional performance from Kershener.In this part of the Star Wars story, Luke Skywalker (performed well by Mark Hamill) is a young space fighter, who believes with no doubt that he will be a Jedi. To be sure, Luke travels to meet with Yoda, Jedi master (Frank Oz). The way that we see Luke and Yoda, during Luke's training to prove that he is a Jedi, is a very touching moment in the entire film. Yoda is a creature that was created by Oz and Lucas, to seem 'real' and that is what I feel he was. Movie critic Roger Ebert said that 'Yoda may actually give the best performance in the movie', and I totally agree.The other good characters include Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and the robot droids R2D2 (Kenny Baker) and C3PO (Anthony Daniels). Han and Leia, continue to say that they are not in love with each other, when everything points to that being the case. Their characters have a great amount of sexual tension and innuendo, a real highlight for me. However supposed friend, Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) betrays Han and his friends, handing them over to the dark side of the force.Yet the continuation of the humorous droids is still as funny as ever in my view. R2D2 is a feisty little robot, who can do breathtaking things. But by looking at him, you would think he just another useless piece of space. He has a constant companion in C3PO, who always seems pretty reserved and tentative when he sees R2D2 doing something dangerous. Most of the responses from C3PO are classic.The dark side of the force still has a great effect on me, when I come to watching this film. The powerful person on the force is Darth Vader (body by David Prowse and voiced by James Earl Jones). Vader in this film shows how cruel, evil, harsh, hateful and driven he is. There are many moments where generals and commanders fail Vader, with the consequence of this not that pleasant. Vader is also another of my all-time favourite Star Wars characters.There are many moments I liked in ESB. The start of the film is wonderful, as we see Luke in major trouble with a scary ice monster. Then Luke and the rebellion have a grand battle with the enemy, which I still find to be entertaining. Then when the battle turns to open space, it is just as exciting, as I start to feel like I want to be in a space ship and give all I have got, to defend the honour of good side of the force. Finally the conclusion of the film is terrific. Firstly, we see Han Solo given a rather unpleasant and creepy demise that certainly upsets Chewy. Then the finale, with Luke battling Vader was marvelous, as we learn through the battle that not all is as Luke seems.In closing, 'The Empire Strikes Back' is one of the great sci-fi movies we have seen. Star Wars may have started it, but ESB certainly continues it in a very great and grand way. This film also gets me very emotional, which just goes to show how passionate I am about these films. With these films now given to us in Special Edition, the way they were supposed to be, it is a great treat for all the fans.

Episode V is 23 years old as of this writing, and it's holding up pretty well in my mind. So as we're closing the LOTR trilogy this season, I was reminded of another trilogy - one that sparked the imaginations of many filmmakers to come, and really made films like RETURN OF THE KING possible. After all, if the second Star Wars movie had bombed, trilogies in big budget filmmaking would probably not have been a popular consideration afterward. And so would we have seen movies like BACK TO THE FUTURE with arcing storylines through three films? Perhaps not.The strengths of the film are the strengths of the filmmakers, and where they were in their lives and careers at the time. A young Harrison Ford, a George Lucas who was willing to truly collaborate, a Lawrence Kasdan at his writing prime - I could go on about the cast and crew, but you get my point. I am not sure if the same people, would it be possible, assembled in 2003, could make as good of a movie as they did then. Timing, as they say, is everything.What we got out of that timing, was the strongest Star Was story told to date, with the best special effects of their time, deeper insight into memorable characters, the darkest, most brooding (and involving) atmosphere in the trilogy, and a couple of serial-type classic plot twists.

This is truly one of the best sequels I have ever seen, not only as a Star Wars film, but as one of the best sequels in the history of film making.

We have Hans Solo being frozen alive, Luke being told that Darth Vader is his actual father and to top it all of he has his arm chopped of by him. As kid's films go, this is brilliant and dark. If the first film was like the magician's trick, this is more like a Shakespearean play, a hint of tragedy taking hold of proceedings. The characters are taken on more darker paths throughout the narrative that leads to a frightening downbeat cliffhanger. There is a sense of maturity in the proceedings here. Maybe it comes with a different director using the special effects tools in a more mature manner of different writers, but the more superficial problems that the first film had are gone here. The acting is much, much better, Mark Hamill putting in a brilliant portrayal of a Luke that is finding his life taking a more darker turn than before. The chemistry between Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford retains some of the more fun and light hearted aspects, but then this leads to a darker pay off and a scene of sheer emotional intensity it is almost blinding. To think, this was intended as a kid's film.Once again the special effects are fantastic, but the screenplay from Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett as well as the direction of Irvin Kershner make this a stand out too. John Williams' music is superb as always, but here he outdoes even himself, possibly doing his finest music for his Hollywood blockbuster market. The sweeping music during the asteroid chase and the Vader theme are undeniably classic pieces of music.\nThis being the second part of the trilogy there are none of the constraints of the first part. The film begins almost mid flow, with the rebels on the run (this in itself marking out the downbeat nature of the film, the rebels aren't so much as fighting as running away), there is no nagging re-introductions of characters or dialog that covers what's happened before in part one, which is most welcome.

And of the Lord Of The Rings movies. Of every adventure movie I have seen, this one is the very best. Why, you will probably ask. Most people I know either prefer Star Wars IV or VI to this one. But I think they forget to take acquintance to the amazing chemistry there is between all the cast in this movie. And the classic scenes, there are many more than in the other movies. Luke meeting Yoda, and Yoda's amazing wisdom for such a small, little green alien. Vader confronts Luke. The truth revealed. Han and Leia's first kiss, and C-3POs interference. The introduction of Lando. Boba Fett. Admiral Piett's absurd rise to great Imperial stature. The battle of Hoth. Han frozen into carbonite. Just about everything of the dialogue, acting, everything of it is so classic, so climatic, so absolutely real. The Empire Strikes Back is the absolutely finest film in the entire Star Wars series. It's so intense, its plot and subplots are perfectly intertwined, just about everything in the film is perfectly fit for its genre.

Other examples of this are \u0091The Godfather' and \u0091The Terminator'. \u0091Star Wars' and \u0091Godfather' were the next chapter in a trilogy and thus were the continuing story rather than the beefing up of an original high concept movie conceived with the sole objective of cashing in on the appeal of the original. \u0091The Terminator' was not planned as a trilogy, but rose above the production company cash \u0096in norm by delivering a developed story and limiting action sequences to fall into the context of the story. These movies indicate to us that good stories are fundamental to the long \u0096 term audience acceptance. Lucas certainly had this in mind. The composition of the next chapter requires character development. Of importance here is ensuring the characters have changed as a consequence of their previous experiences. This not only creates audience interest for the audience, but also offers opportunities for challenging adventures for our heroes. The best example of this is Skywalker. The realisation of his power has given him a sense of purpose and he relishes the opportunity to learn. He retains his youthful enthusiasm and spirit of adventure. Although feeling a high sense of duty, he still has concern for his friends and rushes to their aid. His development as a Jedi Knight has alerted the Empire to the threat that he poses. Vader has relentlessly pursued him and taking advantage of his commitment to his friends, finally manages to lure him into a showdown. This of course led to the memorable scene where Vader reveals his true identity. This set the stage for an engaging conflict in the next chapter. The story can now flow seamlessly thus maintaining the captivated audience. Conflict is what gives impetus to the story and it must be plausible so as to maintain the credibility of the story. It is the prime character driver and as our characters develop, so the conflict becomes greater further motivating them towards resolution. There is no greater emotive conflict than that of father and son on opposing sides of the battlefield. It would be natural for audiences to identify with this. This served to create a solid platform for mass audience appeal. The relationship between Ford and Fisher had grown. Their differences in character had endeared them to each other. The conflict between the two was riddled with weak lines that at times were silly but which probably helped to inspire giggles from the younger members off the audience. It was designed to indicate innocent love. Given the huge success of this movie, the lines would not have gone to waste. Ford was well cast for the role. He is a watered down Clint Eastwood doing it his own way, but as a team player with a strong sense of moral commitment to his friends, much unlike Eastwood who is a loner lacking commitment and with lewd sexual fantasies. Although his character needed to go, the natural family values of Ford seeped into his character. He was not the gunman, but the man fighting for the survival of his family. The acting was the single biggest improvement. Much of this can be credited to the new director. Lucas is a writer by nature and the reticence inherent in a writer may not translate well to that of the director who needs to be outwardly expressive. The most visible improvement for me was that there was a greater menace about Vader. I believe that this was due his less animated style. He was more methodical in method somewhat like a cold assassin. He did not expend unnecessary energy as he ruthlessly hunted down Skywalker. This improvement to the character augmented the dark feel of the movie.Also worthy of special mention was Hamill. Gone were the false facial mannerisms and now we have a performance showing the inner turmoil and conflict. Hamill, with a little help from the director, was growing in stature. The lack of restraint was not evident here as it was in the first one. This was a necessary progression since the character was faced with greater personal conflict and without the restraint we would have had a hammed up offering.An obligatory requirement for sequels is that our heroes encounter different characters on their adventures. This can be a most difficult task, especially when the first chapter was a great success. The idea is to introduce new characters to the audience which would spark new interest as well as being within the context of the story. The new characters of note were the Bounty Hunter and Yoda.The Bounty Hunter blended into the story since he compared well with Vader. This was by no means indicative of a lack of creativity, but was in fact the perfect addition. A character was created that inspired interest, but retained the continuity of the story since he was instantly recognisable as someone who could be in allegiance with the Dark Side. The retention of the story continuity and the addition of originality required inspired creativity.He was human only in shape. We could not see any part of his body thus limiting his identification as an emotional being that could be reasoned with. He was the manifestation of a cold \u0096 blooded killer. Although lacking the over \u0096 bearing presence of Vader, he was an ominous foe. Characters such as these do not have much screen time. The more we know about our foes, the less of a threat they are. Notwithstanding this fact, he is one of the more memorable characters. In the battle between good and evil, Yoda was the wizard preparing the knight for the duel. He had the characteristics necessary of someone on the side of the good. His animated mannerisms and comical features endeared him to the younger audience and his grim warnings about the power of the Dark Side enthused entertainment for the rest. Guinness had a small part to play in this chapter and Yoda was his replacement, thus evidencing the continuity and originality previously mentioned.The assault launched on the imagination by the original had now been intensified with advanced weaponry. Improvements to the armoury were more emotive content within the acting; new characters which added value to the battlefield and of course the then spectacular special effects. Of particular note is the twist in the plot where the true identity of Skywalker's father is revealed to him. This jolt was not enough to awaken us from our trance \u0096 like state of hyper \u0096 imagination. The \u0091Star Wars' machine rolled on ever conquering, enslaving audiences worldwide who readily accepted their subservience. The stage was graced with a story rich in design and complemented with vivid images.

He can never convey the concepts and theories of it (or the belief in it for that matter) to any extent. Hence, the best movie he directed is American Graffiti since it is not so concerned with making obvious subtexts.Lucas pretends to know philosophy in the Star Wars series, but he never embellishes on the gray area between his monolithic \"good\" and \"evil\" sides. That said, The Empire Strikes Back remains the best in the Star Wars series because Lucas lets the reigns of directing fall to someone who knows what they're doing. Irvin Kerschner is not a talented or smart director, but he has more sense in his head than Lucas. Lucas' head is stuck in Never Never Land so it is up to Kerschner to add sense to the movie.There is also the support of Lawrence Kasdan (before the man wound up making garbage like Dreamcatcher) and Leigh Brackett touch up his original story in order to remove unnecessary garbage. As Pauline Kael put it, the movie is not concerned about the \"comic book hedonism\" of the original Star Wars. Return of the Jedi would emphasize what happens when Lucas gets his way (again) and hires out some poor sap to direct. The level of concern about Yoda this time is not the same as the Ewoks in Return of the Jedi, smart move.The level of static shots, using just pans and tilts, are marvelous compared to the constant sense of motion that Star Wars wants to make. It gets worse with Attack of the Clones and Phantom Menace. The biggest factor is that the effects haven't aged. The space scenes are elaborate, but not annoying, and John William's score aptly supports them. Compare the asteroid pursuit here to the vastly inferior one in Episode II, the magic has faded with CGI.Overall, there are good movies and bad ones.

I would have to agree. It's darker, funnier and more dramatic than the first film. Although not a sequel in the strictest sense of the word, it belongs to an elite club of `even-better-than-the-original' films along with The Godfather part II and Toy Story 2.The Empire Strikes Back in the hands of studio bosses would probably have been a straight rehash of the original. Thankfully, George Lucas had complete financial and creative control, bringing in director Irvin Kershner and screenwriters Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett (who died before the film was finished) to help realise his vision. These collaborators deserve as much credit as Lucas himself for the unmitigated masterpiece that resulted.The Empire Strikes Back picks up the story again as the Rebel Alliance are hiding from the evil Empire on snow planet Hoth. Here we are re-introduced to our heroes Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Princess Leia and droids C3PO and R2 D2. Luke is attacked by a snow monster (a kind of abominable snowman called the `Hoth Wampa'). He defeats the creature but is lost in the icy night and begins to freeze to death. In his delirium, Luke sees a vision of his dead mentor Obi Wan Kenobi instructing him to find Jedi Master Yoda and train as a Jedi.At the same time, romance is brewing between Han Solo and Princess Leia, although they both refuse to admit it. Han intends to leave Hoth with co-pilot Chewbacca and pay off his debt to Jabba the Hutt before his bounty hunters catch up with him. However, Han's departure is delayed by rescuing Luke.Unfortunately, It doesn't take long for the Empire, under the leadership of Darth Vader to find the Rebels. Vader has suddenly become obsessed with tracking down Luke Skywalker and turning him to the dark side of the Force. The Rebels are attacked (in a brilliant battle sequence with huge walking machines called AT ATs) and our heroes take separate paths for the remainder of the film. Han, Leia, Chewbacca and C3PO flee Imperial forces through space, and Luke seeks Jedi Master Yoda to be instructed in the Force and become a Jedi.Several things about this film are superior to any other film in the Star Wars canon. For a start, the acting is never better than here (largely thanks to Kershner). Even Mark Hamill is good and the romantic banter between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher is brilliantly performed, recalling the classic Hollywood screwball comedies of the 1930s and 40s (`Would it help if I got out and pushed?') There are some great new characters, such as Yoda (Frank Oz), the best puppet character in film history with the possible exception of ET, and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), a double-dealing rogue from Han's past. Despite having very little screen time, bounty hunter Boba Fett (Jeremy Buloch), became a favourite among fans, and we even get our first glimpse of the evil Emperor (played here by Clive Revill, not Ian McDiarmid).The planets visited are more interesting than in any of the other films. Cloud city is wonderful (especially the carbon freeze chamber), Dagobah is an appropriately gloomy swamp, and the Hoth wastelands are spectacular. The production design is absolutely first rate. Also, John Williams music is at its best here, with fantastic new themes including one for Yoda, a great love theme, and the stunning Imperial march (or Darth Vader theme).Needless to say, the editing, cinematography, sound and special effects are all wonderful (particularly in the asteroid chase). The witty screenplay never wastes a second and is full understated emotion, particularly in the tearful climax to Han and Leia's romance. Is this really the end of Han Solo? In 1980 audiences had to wait three painful years to find out. Now thankfully, we can simply pull out our VHS of Return of the Jedi. By the way, this one also has the best lightsabre duel in the entire saga.Which brings us to the ending. The greatest thing about The Empire Strikes Back is how the plot is propelled, by a brilliant and now legendary twist, to its downbeat conclusion. The dark ending is crucial because it creates a huge sense of uncertainty for the final film. Will good really triumph over evil? This story is great because it's more complex than just good versus bad. Luke not only has to overcome the evil Empire but the evil in himself. It's about resisting temptation, even to the potential cost of ones life.Whatever George Lucas does with Episode III, nothing for me will ever top this truly magnificent film.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "An unmitigated masterpiece", "date": "2003-07-25T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0175396", "sentiment score": [0.0185, 0.1411, 0.5221, 0.2904, 0.028]}, {"content": "\"The Empire Strikes Back\" is about as close to perfection as a movie can get.

Plus, we have the new character of Yoda to dazzle us.

The second/fifth instalment improves on the original in almost every respect. Secure in the knowledge that the film had generated sufficient returns (apparently)to be extended to trilogy form, the scope of the saga both broadened and deepened here.Two things work in the film's favour in this respect. Firstly is Lucas's decision not to direct the second film, apparently due to the on set struggles encountered making the first. Oh happy day. Kersner adds a layer of psychological depth to the characterisations allowing for the darker elements of the story to more fully realised. Dialogue isn't a problem either this time round thanks to Lucas forsaking writing duties in favour of Leigh Brackett and Lawerence Kasdan. Most of what ended up on screen is due to Kasdan as Brackett died of Cancer in 1979, having completed her first draft. Her connection with directors like Howard Hawkes and Film Noir is still evident though, and her contribution to the saga is the dark edge this film has thats sorely missed from other episodes. Kasdan safe pair of hands ensures the proceedings sound as good as they possibly can with a series of highly memorable lines, most of which emanate from Darth Vader.As a self-contained film the only problem with EMPIRE is that it suffers slightly from middle child syndrome. Its too open ended to be fully satisfying and doesn't trouble itself to reintroduce elements from the first film assuming, probably correctly it must be said, that everyone will have seen This New Title is Hopeless. Looking back on the film now you have to wonder how much of the story was really pre-planned. Its often suggested by Lucas that he had it all mapped out in advance but i'm not so sure. Was Vader always Luke's Dad? Was Leia always Luke's sister? The ending suggests yes because they can communicate through the force but hang on, didn't she lay a big incestuous kiss on him back on Hoth? Thank god they didn't have sex!

It is the best of the five Star Wars films, though perhaps that is down to director Irvin Kershner who tweaked George Lucas's original vision into something darker than the original and infinitely bleaker than the follow-up Return of the Jedi. Lucas reportedly hated 'Empire' upon seeing what Kershner had done to his film and put together another cut that he later conceded was inferior, and Kershner's vision made it to screens around the world.***SPOILERS***The Empire Strikes Back serves as an interesting bridge between A New Hope and 'Jedi', introducing Force masters Yoda and the Emperor (the latter not yet played by the magnificent Ian McDiarmid who took on the role in Return of the Jedi three years later), while at the same time taking the original gang of characters and splitting them up in different directions, a scenario copied to the point of tedium by the Expanded Universe books.Based upon the 'classic trilogy', Darth Vader is one of cinema's greatest villains and perhaps it will take until the release of the sixth film in 2005 to be sure what effect the prequels will have had on that image. In 'A New Hope' we are introduced to a near-merciless killer and his evil nature seems to have grown by the time of 'Empire'.

Only the limitations of technology stood in the way of him making shots work exactly as he wanted, and they only took another couple of decades to be removed.In 1980, however, Lucas at least had enough humility to let someone else handle the elements he wasn't so good at, namely story and direction. The result is a Star Wars that feels much more natural and performance-oriented than any other, despite the fact that three have been made since. It can also be argued that Episode V is the one that was least in need of a Special Edition in 1997. The story flowed well with connections to the other two Episodes well-established (except in the case of the earliest link in the Jabba subplot having to be cut out of Episode IV). The acting was as good as the actors could deliver in the hands of a good director, and the effects had evolved just barely enough that the more glaring wrinkles in the original were no longer a problem.It's no surprise, therefore, that most of the changes in the Special Edition are very subtle. In fact, the moment when the Wampa tries to eat Luke is the only obvious place in which a change is made. The other changes mostly consist of placing artifical windows in the Cloud City set to give it a less claustrophobic feel, or things to that effect. Unfortunately, when Lucas does go too far in the restorations or alterations, it sticks out like a sore thumb. The moment when C-3PO says \"at least you're still in one piece\" to R2-D2 is a classic example. This shot worked well in its original form because everything about it was connected properly to the rest of the footage. In the Special Edition, it looks more like they took a bad angle, added some very silly-looking artificial sky to it, and just wedged it in there. Not exactly what I would call a seamless change.Another problem with the Special Edition is that it doesn't respect the audience's intelligence a hell of a lot. Some very unconvincing footage of Darth Vader ordering his men to let the crew of his Star Destroyer know he is coming back to take charge was added when it was just far more expedient (not to mention mature in terms of storytelling) to have Vader appear on the capital ship and let the audience assume he just got there by whatever means he had at his disposal. Instead, Lucas assumes that his audience is either less than five years old or has an IQ that doesn't exceed room temperature. Another example of him somehow acquiring Barney syndrome between 1983 and 1997.The original cut of the film is worthy of a nine out of ten (a point being deducted for some very silly effects in places). Unfortunately, the new version is only an eight. It crosses the line between enhancing the film and what happens when a child keeps adding colours upon colours to a drawing.

Han Solo's reply to Leia's \"I love you.\" is beatiful and perfect, not over the top and sappy.

Throughly real and believable. Unlike so many of the stereo types we see today. Han and Leia's romance is the best movie romance ever. Period.The rest of the movie is surperb as well. Yoda seems so real, even though you know he's a puppet you feel like he exist SOMEWHERE. You just have to find where. And he delivers profound wisdom in a funny voice and reverse syntax, yet still it sounds profound. Not THAT is genius.And Mark Hamil as Luke Skywalker is greatly improved here, his scene in the cave on Dagobah is eeiry and cuts very close to home when he realizes the darkness in himself.And Darth Vader takes his place as the greatest movie villian of all time, becomming not just some mechanical terror, but a real and toremented person, you start to wonder whats going on under the mask. \"Luke, I am your father.\" the most startling pronouncment in movie history.What can I say.

Star Wars was a science fiction film that focused on escapism rather than scientific lore that usually weighs down other sci-fi films. Instead of explaining everything through the actors dialogue Lucas just showed us with sophisticated direction, set designs, and special effects. Still if it was not for Empires Strikes Back the Star Wars saga would not have achieved the level of pop culture status that it now enjoys, for if it was Star Wars that introduced us to the worlds and the main characters of the original trilogy it was Empire Strikes back that gave us the entire theme of Star Wars saga. It clearly showed us the struggles of the good and power of the evil. The empire is just not a government body to be despised but to be feared as well. The Empire is a collected evil who iss everywhere. The story also reveals much more in terms of who Luke actually is, of his gifts, and how he could be a candidate for either good or evil. As well it hints at the connection between Luke and Leia and of course reveals the Luke and Vader connection. Plus this film through color and music and the interweaving of character development and action sequences swings us a way from the space opera frivolity of the first film and sends us through a mystical fantasy both dark and beautiful, dangerous and brilliant. Last of all the writing in the film elevated the saga in a way that no other Star Wars film has been able to do. Leigh Bracket and Lawrence Kasdan worked wonders in their screenplay. Instead of soaking some serious and more romantic moments with dialogue that is heavy worded we get moments that are mixed with clever one liners and situations that forces Han and Leia to fall in love. I wish I could say the same about Attack of the Clones love story, which was fine but failed to capture that sort of chemistry.In short this films is a masterpiece and one that has not been matched. It has not been matched in memorable characters, plot revelations, atmosphere, or music.

Being the second of the original trilogy it has neither the fresh appeal of originality that marked its predecessor, nor is it required to reach any conclusions. The result is a film with decidedly minimalist plot development. The Empire is still hunting down the Rebel Alliance, Luke Skywalker is still training to be a Jedi knight, and. . . . .. . . . . well, that's pretty much it. Instead of a solid storyline, the viewer is treated to 122 minutes of cobbled-together battle sequences (although watch for the impressive Imperial walker troop carriers, which resemble out-sized armoured elephants). The characters however, have developed considerably since the first film - it's nice to see loyal Chewbacca show a sense of humour. The sexual tension between Princess Leia and Han Solo is palpable. . . . . . . . . . until they kiss (which looks about as exciting as snogging a shoe). In a clever twist, Yoda the Jedi Master is not a Hercules-type warrior, but a wizened green dwarf; the characterisation would have worked even better had he not had a voice a-la-Sesame Street. In the Special Edition of Episode IV, A New Hope, there is an obvious and uncomfortable chasm between those scenes which have been unaltered since they were shot in 1977 and those that were digitally re-mastered and altered 20 years later. Fortunately the same is not the case in Episode V. But why was it necessary to darken the picture contrast so drastically?

Why? I could give many reasons, most of which would have been said before. However, this film really does have a completely different feel to it compared to Episodes IV and VI. People say it's dark, and it is, but there is a lot more to it. There is this transitional feel about the characters and the movie, something which shows how our intrepid heroes are being forced into darkness. Luke Skywalker, is learning about his past and the powers that he has inherited from his estranged father. This also introduces Yoda into the saga. Han Solo and Leia are falling in love, this changes Solo's character from the out and out space cowboy, so to speak, that we know from Episode IV. He has mellowed and found different priorities in his life. This is definitely the middle ground for the development of this character. I never liked what he became in Episode VI, his role in the movie was poor and he had changed a lot from the loveable \"rogue\" that we saw in Episode IV. Leia's character had changed from a slightly stuck up \"princess\" in Episode IV to a more \"lets get down to it\" action character who was not afraid to get stuck in, fix equipment and shoot a blaster. Then we have all the obvious plot developments. Seriously, a great film. For me Harrison Ford, aka Han Solo, is the star of the film. His character was a whiny, annoying kid (like we see from his father in Episodes I and II) in Episode IV but in Empire we see the beginnings of the man he becomes. There is so much about this film, and the characters, that make it No #1! Add all this in and is it any surprise that this is the film where George Lucas didn't write any of the script, or direct it?

Quality stories are few and far between, with a return to the fantasy genre as a last refuge for the scoundrel. The two Star Wars prequels further illustrate this weakness in science fiction. In other words, we are always making comparisons to THIS film, the grandmaster of all modern science fiction films, \"The Empire Strikes Back\".ESB stands on its own merits for so many reasons that I can only hope to give a partial list. Having gotten out of the way the troublesome task of introducing us to the Star Wars universe in the 1977 adventure, we can now jump into the frantic struggle of the Rebellion. Anything introduced in \"Star Wars\" is simply improved upon in ESB, not overproduced and overrefined. The look of ESB is real, gritty, elegant, and sometimes even glowing (as in the Cloud City). The elements of creating mood and atmosphere are so perfect that it is no wonder they are copied in so many other films, often to poor effect. The music alone goes from brooding to anxious to frantic to mysterious to exotic with such balance that it defines perfection for future SW film scores.The acting is real and hard and makes no apologies. It is neither over-the-top nor sleepwalked through, and each character is at his/her highest note. Yes, the technobabble in some points sounds stupid at times, but it's overpowered by the myriad other positive elements in the storytelling. ESB is the last movie made before the Indiana Jones films forever influenced adventure movies with the relentlessly overlapping and often ridiculous action that hurt \"Return of the Jedi\" in 1983. (\"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" would hammer home the formula of serials to the extent that RotJ would be fraught with juvenile moments and caricaturizations of beloved characters, but that's another story.)Yoda was, at the time of ESB's release, a technological miracle of storytelling. Here was a muppet that audiences just *knew* was real, somewhere in the Universe. His wisdom reached deep into the human soul, sounding ominous, real, and masterful. The power of the character of Yoda is seen in how many adults as well as teenagers and kids in 1980 accepted him as real and respectable.What more could be said about \"The Empire Strikes Back\"? It's the masterpiece all others strive to become similar to and never achieve. It ends on a cliffhanger and yet is a self-contained story.

It deserves to be in the top 10 films of all time in my opinion. Unlike most Star Wars films, this one doesn't all focus on shooting and killing. Much of it is centered on Luke training to be a Jedi and Han and Leia's romance.One of the first scenes in the movie is the best war scene that'll probably ever be made. The empire deploys \"Imperial Walkers\" to lumber slowly towards the Rebel base to destroy the shield generator so that the Imperial fleet can invade the Rebel base. Luke and company try to bring down the walkers in \"snowspeeders\", in one of the most enjoyable battle scenes to watch in the trilogy.The scene directly after that one is probably one of the best as well. Han, Leia, Chewbacca, and C-3P0 are attempting to escape from the Rebel base in the Falcon, but run into two problems: the Falcon's hyperdrive is damaged, making it impossible to go into lightspeed. Secondly, the Imperial fleet is right on top of them. In a brilliantly-thought-of scene, Han escapes the TIE fighters in an asteroid field and finds \"shelter\" in a big asteroid.Those two scenes alone make this movie one of the best made ever. Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher return from the original film to play their parts even better (Ford had a dramatic improvement from the first one) and Billy Dee Williams played well as Lando Calrissian.\nA must see for anybody, even those who weren't huge fans of the series.

Luke Skywalker explores his Jedi heritage only to be confronted with disturbing truths, Darth Vader continues his quest tom punish the Rebels, and Han and Leia are on the run. The galaxy has become a much darker, more dangerous place.After a traumatizing experience directing the first Star Wars film, series creator George Lucas vowed he would stay away from the camera this time, and crank up his degree of control. Because, while production had been misery, young George had negotiated the shrewdest deal in film history: exclusive rights on all Star Wars related content and derived products. When Star Wars became not just A hit but THE hit of the century, Mr Lucas held all the cards.While the subsequent creation of a prequel trilogy might taint the whole story in retrospect, one should admire George Lucas for opting to be as faithful to his story as possible, and for deploying unprecedented independent power to back his vision. So Lucas enlisted director Irvin Kershner as well as writers Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kadan and put them to work. Lucas kept his focus on overall production and the effects work, the complexity of which far exceeded anything attempted 3 years prior.The result, any Star Wars fan will concede, is not just the finest film in the series but one of the best sequels ever made. Much like the benchmark Godfather Part II, it builds on and deepens the themes of its predecessor while exploring new, unchartered territory. It also took many brave narrative risks, most of them ruined by the unnecessary prequels. it gave the characters new depth and resonance, along with some of the most memorable dialogue in a series not often noted for its language or performances.Watching the bad guys have their day can be a thrilling experience and, as the title implies, this is the Empire's film through and through.

In the 1977 Star Wars, there is a clear reliance on simplicity in some parts. Obviously, it is much more than a simply made science fiction film, but like I said in my review of it, there was a lot of highly effective reliance on things that were not put on screen, such as Obi Wan's description of The Force to Luke. In The Empire Strike Back, the first thing that we are treated to is the traditional scrolling text along a background of stars, depicting what has happened between the last film and this one, and reminding us of the things that were mentioned in the last film but never explained.At first, this would almost seem to be a way to save money to get more information across to the audience without having to actually put it on screen, but this is really an ingenious way of furthering the story. The very fact that we are so willing to read all this information and forgive our inability to actually see it is a testament to the quality of the series, even at this early stage in its presentation, and we know the story so well from the first film that we are glad to see such a large change in what's happening in the films, not for a second lamenting the fact that we have obviously missed so much action. And besides that, if and when George Lucas runs out of new prequels to release, and maybe if he someday begins to run low on how many hundreds of millions of dollars he has, he could go right back and make these in-between scenes into full length films. What would he call these, if he did that? Introquels? Who cares! The names themselves would be interesting enough, and if you go back and read the stuff that introduces this film, it's obvious that there's an entire film there just waiting to be made. I guess the question of actors would be a formidable one, though.The Empire Strikes Back is the film where we are first introduced to the great Jedi master Yoda (`Away put your weapon!'), as well as some of the most thrilling battle sequences of the entire Star Wars series, and that includes the prequels. The battle scene where the rebels fight the Imperial Walkers on the ice planet is an incredibly well-made battle scene, not only in the way that it was put together so convincingly using models, but that the machines themselves are so creatively made. Indeed, the Imperial Walkers are some of the most recognizable machines from the entire Star Wars saga, right up there with the Millennium Falcon and the Death Star.\nI have just watched this film again, having already seen Episode I and Episode II, and not having seen any of the original Star Wars films for maybe 10 years (except for the original 1977 Star Wars, which I saw and reviewed a few days ago - and these aren't even the Special Edition versions!). When I first saw Yoda when watching The Empire Strikes Back again, I was really struck by how different he looked from in the newer movies. Obviously, he's completely computer generated in the new films, but here in Episode V he looks like a muppet! Even so, I would like to express my opinion that Yoda is more realistic and more interesting here as a puppet than in the newer films as a computer generated image. At least here in the older films you know that he's actually THERE, and that he's not just added into the film later.Oh yeah, speaking of Yoda, can I just complain for a minute? What the hell was up with the Jedi training? Yes, I realize that I'm just a lowly IMDb reviewer, while The Empire Strikes Back is a part of the greatest science fiction series of all time, but would it have killed George Lucas to write in a little more creative training for Luke? The thing that struck me first about the Star Wars films when I first started watching them was how incredibly imaginative they were, but then Luke started his training. You know, when I was in high school I played football. I was a wide receiver/tight end and I hardly ever got to play because I was too tall and too skinny, but part of my workout was to carry the linemen up and down the stairs to the weight room. Some of these guys weighed 100 pounds more than me, and I still almost never saw the field, and here's Luke Skywalker. He carries Yoda around this boggy swamp and he gets to be a Jedi! What the hell!There is also the addition of a surprisingly fitting love story. First of all, anyone who has ever read my review of a Jerry Bruckheimer movie will know that I am not the biggest fan of cramming a love story into a movie where it doesn't belong. I can't seem to write anything about Bruckheimer movies without complaining about the idiot love story, and now it's even worse because here's this movie that was made so long before, from which Bruckheimer could obviously have at least learned a LITTLE bit about how to do it right. Han Solo and Princess Leia maintain the personalities that they developed in the first Star Wars film and there is now a sort of love/hate relationship between the two of them, where neither one of them wants to admit their feelings for the other. This romantic subplot is characterized perfectly in the scene just before Solo is carbon frozen, when Leia risks approaching a cheesy romantic moment by saying `I love you' just before Han is lowered into the freezing chamber, and he saves the moment by responding, `I know.' Han Solo. Smart-ass to the last drop.Before I end I would like to point out that the goofs that can be found on the IMDb for this film are some of the most blatant that I've ever seen in a film. The scene where you can see someone giving a woman at the tactical maps a cue to deliver her lines is amazingly obvious, and some of the other ones, such as the stage hand swinging the light saber prop briefly into view as he switches it for an `off' prop with Luke just after he knocks Darth Vader over backwards, are just as much fun to look for. I have one question about the goofs, though. There's one where Luke looks off into the fog just after R2-D2 is eaten by the sea monster, and you can CLEARLY see a person running to the right a little ways off in the fog. Is that meant to be Luke? It seems that it's supposed to be him running in his search for R2, because you can even hear the FOOTSTEPS of the person running. I can't even IMAGINE how they could have missed THAT!!It is, however, a testament to the quality of a film when such tremendous oversights in editing do nothing to take away from the overall quality of the film. The Empire Strikes Back remains an extremely powerful and well-made installment in the Star Wars series, not taking even a single step backwards in the sheer breathtaking adventure of the original film. It's not often that a film as good as Star Wars can be released and then followed up with a sequel that is just as great, as is clearly the case here.

Easily, the greatest of the five Star Wars films made so far and one of the greatest fantasy films of all time. I remember what a revelation ESB was when I first saw it as a child. What a contrast it was from the first film. From the offset, it was darker and more brooding and psychological. It was of a more mature nature and had the richest character development of any of the Star Wars films. In a way, I think that it was the most \"realistic\" of all these films, in that it was more grounded in solid emotions and there was palpable resonance to it. This truly is the film that solidified the Star Wars mythology, and it defined and molded the characters in ways that give them all deeper meaning, purpose, and motivation. Everything starts working on a whole other level. To me its all about dark family secrets lurking just beneath the surface, and you definitely feel that all throughout this film. When the awful \"truth\" is revealed in the end, you realize that the clues have really been there all along. Luke's anguished cry after Vader tells him that \"I am your father\", is not one of shock or denial, but of the acceptance of something that he has really known all along. And Vader suddenly has more form and dimension. He has a purpose (as all truly great villains must). Is he not now, after all, basically a father trying to find his children and bring them to his side? Yoda is wise and wonderful and really embodies all the magic of this modern fantasy myth. The developing romance between Han and Leia is engaging and believable. And there's real chemistry there.

Mark Hamill is better here than he was in A New Hope, probably because he is in more dangerous situations than he was in A New Hope. I think this is because in the original and ROTJ, Hamill was pretty bland and flat unless if he was in a real turning point or in danger, which was pretty scarce in those films except when he found his aunt and uncle dead, or a couple of other situations I forget. Carrie Fisher isn't as semi-wooden here either, she is actually quite good.Thridly, the effects look more polished.

Tonight I watched them all again to refresh my memory of what it is all about to give a better viewing of Episode II: Attack of the Clones tomorrow night at 12 am. \tI initially saw Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back on its opening weekend in a small theater in Crescent City, CA as a touch more than a neophyte movie aficionado. Hitchcock flicks were my favorite at that time. Hitch is still one of my favorite past filmmaker with Hawks and Capra close seconds. These days my tastes lean to Scorsese, Aronofsky and the Coen Brothers. Coppola, Speilburg and Lucas are very good, but to me are more great craftsman than great artists. All have had artistic successes (The Godfather, Schindler's List and THX 1138), but I think they are better craftsman than artists over all. \tLucas is by far one of the greatest producers and craftsman of all time and has done more for true independent film than possibly any director/producer since Chaplin. I also feel strongly that Empire is a far better film than Star Wars with tighter pacing, dialog and performances all around. The was a fluidity that the first one lacked and feel that was built in was not only what was \"tight about it\". \tThe \"weaknesses\" of Star Wars as a piece of \"art\", or even craft is dwarfed by its emotional impact and timing of release. I was ten when I saw it the first time (several weeks after it was released) and I had to share a seat in the front row with my younger brother who didn't like me much at the time. Once the music started and the words rolled up the screen we didn't care and loved every single second! All we told our dad when he met us out front afterwards was \"can we see it again dad, can we see it again dad...\". I saw it eleven time in the theater that summer including three time in a row on a great day. This is amazing since my town had only one theatre/screen and it was exceptional that it stayed around long enough for me see it as often as I did. The Trilogy was the first VHS I ever owned (my mother paid $70 each in 85). \tMy point is that emotional attachment, or detachment to a film is equally important to what a person may think of it critically as a piece of art, or entertainment. I have loved all the Star Wars films and have seen them all except for the first one on its opening day and even the first show of that day with the last two! All that said however, I wouldn't call any of them \"great films\". Important and amazing films, \"Hell Ya!\". Some of the best rides I have ever had, \"Hell Ya!\". Worth watching all in a row every now and again, you bet. \tEpisode V is more of a love story and character developing episode IV which is why it tends to be many folks favorite thus far. Knowing it will be a blast and finding out that Vader is really Luke's dads only bolsters it. I think Jedi is the best still and part of that may be the fact that I knew that Blue Harvest was really Star Wars III (episode VI) when they shot all the wonderful \"forest\" scenes. I didn't watch them do it, but knowing it was happening and that the speeder chases were truly impossible (since I lived and played Star Wars in those woods), yet there they were right in front of my eyes. This may be why it still has the strongest hold on my heart!

I would call ESB the most atmospheric, exiting, and well-paced of the series. The development of the Han/Leia tension which started in the first film is going full steam ahead here, with some of the best one-liners in the history of one-liners. It's sad that this tension completely dies in Return of the Jedi; just because they love each other doesn't mean they can't fight any more! The action scenes in episode V are, IMHO, second only to the huge battle at the end of Ep VI. I don't have the wide-screen version, so I'll have to admit that I've never seen it in all of it's glory, but the star destroyer chase/asteroid sequence is incredible (i.e. the podrace in epI is a drive to moosejaw in comparison). The plot in ep V takes some very cool twists: the introduction of a new mentor for Luke, some revelations about his origins, and a conflict between his destiny as a Jedi and his love for his friends. I'm not sure which of the three writers of this film are responsible for this stuff, but it's presented here in a way totally different than in any of the later films.I won't ever say this is the best of the Star Wars saga, that's not something I can decide.

Much more so than the other movies, it has an incredible cliff-hanger appeal. Lucas, in the Malten interviews, explained the nature of the \"middle film\" in a trilogy. This movie serves to take the protagonists and throw them into the most desperate situation imagineable. For this reason, this is the darkest movie (as of yet--look for Episode III to be the \"Empire\" of the entire saga).What really grabs me about this movie is the music. Even more than A New Hope, John Williams used the character themes to their greatest effect. This film introduces one of the most infamous and beloved themes in all of film (or, dare I say it? popular music): Vader's Theme. From the tense prelude to those first three notes--BOM BOM BOM--the emotional impact is through the roof. The introduction of this theme is fitting, as Vader is finally realized in this film.We also get a very boy-friendly dose of a love story in this movie. In fact, the relationship between Han and Leia is one of the most interesting in all of film. It's piratical swashbuckler meets strong willed, capable princess. Han solo is developed into the most loveably arrogant character possible. Near the end of the movie, Leia tells him, \"I love you.\" Han's response and the circumstances surrounding this exchange define all that sets Star Wars apart from the rest of the pack. I adore Star Wars. So far, this is the movie that gives the series it's push. This is when we learn how much we really want our heroes to triumph and what they are up against.

Empire Strikes Back(1980) is filled with a machine of emotions that lead its characters and main plot. Emotions and feelings of Luke, Han, and Leia are developed to the point where they are multi-dimensional as people. Yoda gives Luke Skywalker tests which are based on emotions that can lead him either on the good or the dark side.\nDark tale about the nature of the dark side, and of human nature itself. Pessemistic film that goes from one desperate situtation to another for the rebels, especially Han, Luke, and Leia. Excells from not having nice, friendly, childish environment like others in Star Wars films. Instead it focuses on the character development improved from the first film, and the approaching sense of hopelessness faced by the three main heros.\nThe acting in Empire Strikes Back(1980) in my opinion is muched improved compared to the first film. Mark Hamill as Luke although still shows slight tendencies of annoyance, these tendencies are few and far between. He achieves a level of maturity in playing Luke especially in transforming him to a tragic character who has to face the truth the hard way. Alex Guiness as the ghost of Luke's mentor, and in essence surrogate father, Obi Wan Kenobi, is a class act in his performance.\nThe evolving love story between Han Solo and Leia is credible, fatalistic, and romantic at the same time. Unlike in The Phantom Menace, where the impending love story is presented in a sappy and stupid fashion, the love between Han and Leia gives the viewer something touchingly romantic. The moment when they kiss before they are separated as Han is about to face a tragic fate is highly tragicly emotional. One of the many great attributes that the film has to offer, and delivers in deep way.\nThe opening scenes in the snow are fantastic, and the landscapes are shown with beauty, and remarkable skill by director. The battle moments are especially impressive and without a sense of staleness unlike battle scenes in other Star Wars films. The scene where Luke escapes from the Abominable Snowman like creature escalates the suspense mode to a high measure. The fight against the walking tall animal like battleship machines are cherographed with excellence.\nEmpire Strikes Back(1980) deals with facing fears and learning how to control them. That is the basic essence which, is carried out to a t by Irvin Kershner. Interested in human nature and the surprises which comes with what a person may learn about oneself or another closely linked to him/her. One of many interesting ideas explored by George Lucus, and director, Irvin Kershner that is pushed into the storyline with complex ideas on the mystery of the human spirit.\nThe Empire Strikes Back(1980) is the best of the Stars Wars films for a few reasons. First, George Lucus did not direct it so in a way it was strenghten by someone who could do things with the film that Lucus wouldn't do had he directed. Second, doesn't have any chracter that is annoying or nonusefull, except for the former I would have to say A2D2, but only for a brief moment. Third, has characters to actually believe in and a storyline that's isn't just there to please a children section of an audience.\nHarrison Ford's performance as Han Solo in Empire Strikes Back(1980) is majorly improved over the one in Star Wars(1977). In two years, Harrison Ford appeared in dark films...I.E, Empire Strikes Back(1980), and Blade Runner(1992) which contain a few of his best and interesting roles. The scene where Luke is given a test and is taken aback when he finds out the practrice Darth Valder he kills, is himself is my favorite scene in the entire film. Inspired a similar notion in the samurai dream sequence of Terry Gilliam's Brazil(1985). The last film Howard Hawks writer, Leigh Brackett got involved in a motion picture before her death in 1980.\nThe surprise twist that is revealed near the ending took me by shock in a grand way the first time I saw the film. Even today although the shock value of it has lessen, the magnitude of the moment hasn't. Gives the plot a fatalistic and tragic quality, which is lacking from the other Star Wars movies. The surprise twist is about finding out something dark and unwelcomed about something, and dealing to learn how to deal with it.\nOne actor who has a breif cameo in Empire Strikes Back(1980) is Treat Williams. The body of David Prowse and the voice of James Earl Jones combine to make one impressionable imposingly memorable screen villain. Carrie Fisher does an alright job in the role of Leia.

With \"Star Wars\" already engrained into popular culture shortly after its release (much like \"The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring\" is today), fans were left to ponder what the sequel could offer. Three years after the release of the original, they found out. \"The Empire Strikes Back\" delivers a strong emotional punch. Unlike its predecessor however it is not an uplifting and feelgood film. Far from it in fact. \"Empire\" is a dark, brooding and somewhat surreal film, bristling with conflict and drama. As a result it stands head and shoulders above its prequels and sequel.We join the Rebel Alliance possibly five or so years since the destruction of the Death Star. Despite their victory, the Empire continues to close in. Retreating to the ice planet of Hoth, the Rebels are on the run. A hugely impressive Imperial Starfleet nears Hoth under the leadership of Darth Vader. Obsessed with locating young Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) Vader is unrelenting in his pursuit. Urged on by the knowledge that Skywalker represents a shift in the balance of the Force, Vader vows to either destroy the boy or turn him to the Dark Side to benefit himself and the Emperor.Meanwhile Luke himself has grown up, if only slightly, since his accomplishments in the first film. More aware of his uncanny power, Luke feels the Force now but cannot control its impulses. His talent is raw and under the advise of the apparition of Obi Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness), Luke is instructed to learn from Yoda, a great Jedi Master on the planet of Degobah.As the Empire invades Hoth we are treated to an impressive ground battle. Making use of the wads of money available to him at the time, Lucas and director Irvin Kershner commit to a great deal of stop motion camerawork, with the AT-AT walkers and Snowspeeders in combat. Even today, 22 years since \"Empire\" was released, it still impresses. We also witness the first sparks of romance between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). Their character development in this film outweighs their contribution in the sequel \"Return of the Jedi\", but it works perfectly here.The Empire is presented as a powerful but incompetent and bickering military machine, with officers destroyed at Vader's whim. Impatient and lacking any tolerance whatsoever, Vader is infuriated at the inability of his highest ranking officers. The Empire seems to fulfill the notion of trying to crack a walnut with a steamroller: powerful but ineffective.The film's dark and eerie tone takes off when Luke arrives on Degobah. A huge swamp of animal, plant and supernatural life, Degobah is an embodiment of the Force. After crashlanding his X Wing Fighter, Luke wishes to locate Yoda. Impatient and complaining, Luke is shocked to find a small creature who he originally dismisses as a pest actually IS Yoda. Mindful of Luke's age and impatience, Yoda is reluctant to train him. Obi Wan Kenobi's spirit urges Yoda to try. He agrees and Luke's training begins. Luke is tested beyond his mental and spiritual beliefs under Yoda's guidance as he faces his ultimate fear and the possible confirmation of his dark beliefs.\nThe Yoda character (a puppet performed by Frank Oz), is at once cute and believable. His wisdom is beyond comprehension and his ability to conduct and feel the Force is illustrated brilliantly. Add in John Williams' \"Yoda's Theme\" and you have the makings of one of the more memorable of all characters in the saga.Aware of his abilities to see the past and the future, Luke envisions the possible death of Han and Leia as they are double-crossed after seeking asylum. Torn between finishing his training and saving his friends, Luke leaves Degobah to save them. Little does he know their suffering is nothing more than a trap set by Darth Vader on the Cloud City of Bespin.Luring him in, Vader challenges Luke. Fans of the original lightsabre duel between Obi Wan Kenobi and Darth Vader will get blown away here. The battle still remains the best of all duels in the saga, with the ultra powerful Vader manipulating the young but strong Luke. Set in the dark hues of black, blue and grey their lightsabre fight and its subsequent shock conclusion make \"Empire\" truly memorable.The film's ending is left wide open and ready for \"Return of the Jedi\" as the viewer leaves the film uncertain but eager for more. The special effects and set and costume design remains superb and the floating menace of the Empire's Starfleet is more awe inspiring and terrifying than the original's Death Star. The dark tone of this film is replaced by a warmer feel in ROTJ, but it is the power and dramatic tension that makes this film the best of the \"Star Wars\" saga so far.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "The pinnacle of the \"Star Wars\" saga", "date": "2002-01-29T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0175206", "sentiment score": [0.0031, 0.0277, 0.2124, 0.6849, 0.072]}, {"content": "A sequel better than the original.

But it feels like the coldest (yet is also the most mature) of the saga. It easily betters Jedi (although it's not quite as complete) but rejects the niave charm of a New Hope in favour of operatic grandeur. It is easily the most serious, even including some bizarre Freudian imagery (the dream sequence when Luke chops Vaders' head off, the mask dissappears, and Lukes' face appears underneath) and some genuine wisdom from a little green thing called Yoda (\u0091Do or do not- there is no try'). The humour is almost completely absent and lacks the leisureley pace of the first film, and the sense of drama doesn't meld too well with some of the wooden one liners. But what does make it a very near standout of the saga is the levels to which it brings the \u0091good vs. evil' concept to- here, Luke is seen as a confused figure of identity, and the revelation that Vader is his father (I presume all of you have seen this anyway- no spoilers here) is completely devastating to someone who believes that goodness, purity and heroism manifests itself so strongly within him that something as evil as Vader couldn't possibly be his father. The fact that Vader tries to corrupt Luke the same way he himself was corrupted, but Luke manages to refuse the temptation of power- shows that evilness is a form of corruption rather than something which we carry in our blood. And did you see any of these valuable issues raised in the Phantom Menace? No. Do you know why that particular film sucks when compared to this one? You should do by now.

Same goes for the love theme of Han and Leia, Yoda's theme, and the list goes on. On the acting side, Harrison Ford's acting on this one was his most mature performance out of all STAR WARS movies. His performance on \"Return of the Jedi\" looked watered down compared to this one. Same goes for Carrie Fisher's performance. In \"Return\" she looks tamed and subdued, a far cry from the bossy, devil-may-care attitude of the first one and \"Empire\". And Mark Hammil's acting on this one was his most solid and convincing. It's weird that \"Empire\" worked so well, since most of director Irving Keshner's movies are always a bit contrived. He also did \"Robocop 2\", but that was a mess (thanx in part to the plotless script and last minute re-writes). \"Empire\" is a movie that I saw when I was 12 years old, and to this date, it still amazes me. Let's hope that George Lucas comes to his senses and do the new trilogy justice with the upcoming \"Episode II\".", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 2}, "heading": "I Agree with you all: Empire RULES!!!", "date": "2001-12-04T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0175195", "sentiment score": [0.0062, 0.0378, 0.1953, 0.616, 0.1448]}, {"content": "This one is exelent and almost as good as A New Hope.

The tone of the series takes a darker turn as George Lucas's sequel masterfully delves into the physical, emotional, mental and spiritual developments of the lead characters and the ominous challenges they encounter. In my opinion, \"Empire\" really set a standard for future sequels in other popular Hollywood franchises because of the fact that it was so different in style and mood from its predecessor. And beyond that, the movie reflects something else. In almost every popular legend, the hero of humanity must undergo a shadowy trial as a prerequisite to fulfilling his (or her) destiny of liberating a civilization, or in this case, a galaxy. From his survival on the ice planet Hoth, to his intensified Jedi training on Dagobah, to the shocking revelation of his father's identity at Cloud City towards the film's conclusion, the story of Luke manifests how much psychological obstacles he must confront before reaching full maturity as a Jedi Knight.Another classic story element brilliantly woven into the film is the epic romance. As with the mythical love affair between Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere of the King Arthur tales, Han Solo and Princess Leia embark on a journey to which they eventually discover a priceless treasure, their undying love for each other and the pain they must bear upon separation.The introduction of the alien Jedi Master Yoda is a magnificent addition to the Star Wars saga. Joining Obi-Wan Kenobi as Luke's mentor, he is a much-beloved character with notable reason. Yoda to me represents a cultural embodiment of wisdom, patience and understanding. Thousands of years from now, when Star Wars to many people is the equivalent of what a classic literature piece like \"20,000 Leagues Under the Sea\" is to us, Yoda shall remain a symbol and inspiration for knowledge, peace and guidance. \nI found the acting and dramatic sequences here to be much more poignant, and I suppose that is to be expected when characters are to grow as a film myth like Star Wars progresses. Through such a cinematic formula, one can get really involved in the star actors of \"Empire.\" The same feeling of awe and fantasy felt in the first \"Star Wars\" can be found in \"Empire,\" everything is technically dazzling.

Empire was and still is, so far, the best Star Wars installment to grace our big screens. The plot line was superb and really made for a hell of a ride for us to enjoy. The character development in this movie, from Han to Leia, Luke to Vader, Lando to Han, etc. was perfect. The special effects were taken to a all new level of intensity (the Hoth battle is still one of the best battle sequences ever--real or not). And John Williams' score is phenomenal.\nIt is very rare for any movie to make this claim, but Empire is one of the few sequels that out shines its predecessor. I think one of the reasons I also like Empire so much is the fact that it gave the Star Wars universe a much more grittier and darker tone. Darth Vader really became one of cinemas greatest bad guys in this. And Boba Fett was quite the bad ass mercenary/bounty hunter.Another reason I believe Empire is so much more popular and better than the rest of the trilogy is due to the fact it has a very emotional side to it. This gives the viewer a chance to become more closely involved with all the characters.

The romance of Han (Harrison Ford and Leia (Carrie Fisher), the conflict between Luke and Darth Vader as well as the friendship formed between Luke and Yoda make for an enjoyable and interesting slice of entertainment.

As chaos sets in on the base, Leia and droid C-3PO end up on board Solo's Millennium Falcon and they make their bid for freedom unsure of their destination. Meanwhile, Luke and R2-D2 have crash-landed on Dagoba and find it to be a dank, unpleasant swamp crawling with all manner of insects and strange wildlife. Luke finds Yoda eventually, but he is not what he expected at all.

I always thought that way and I guess that will never change. Of course I got some criticism, but it is basically the same I have for Episode IV and that would be that the special effects seem not as good as they once did, which is basically due to the enormous change and improvement on the special effects department. Besides that though I do not have any criticism on this film. As with the other Episode I also am talking about the Special Edition here and I must say that Lucas has done some good improvement with this Episode as well. There were a bunch of altered or added effects, like explosions and a few scenes in the city in the clouds, but the part that was altered best, I think, was the one in the beginning involving the creature in the snow. There were really some good scenes integrated here, which all looked very real. Maybe besides the fact that there was just a little blood when Luke gave the creature that stroke with the saber. That might be another criticism of this film. I mean there is quite a bit of lightsaber action in which someone is hit (three scenes) and it just appears that there is almost no blood lost. This might be regarded as a bit unreal by some people, but I was satisfied with that, for I am used of it since I was just a little kid and I think it was much better than the stuff that happened for instance in Indiana Jones (which I saw when I was about 11 or so) . For those scenes at the end of the first Indiana Jones really gave me the creeps when I watched that film for the first time and I had quite a couple of nightmares afterward. Whereas nothing of that kind happened after I had seen any of the thee \u0091old' episodes of the Star Wars Saga about a year earlier.\nWhat I especially like about this film is, of course the battle on Hoth, right at the beginning, which starts this episode of the epic tale. In this film there are much more elaborate and much better battle scenes. But not only on Hoth, but also on the city in the clouds. I'm not talking about those laser fights here, but I'm talking about the lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, which is so much better than the saber duel in Episode IV between Obi Wan and Vader. Last but not at all least there is much more character development in this one than in Episode IV and that also is what makes this such a great film. Besides all that, this film also introduces us to Yoda, (well if you've not seen Episode I that is) and the Emperor, who is the driving force behind the oh \u0096 so evil Vader. Speaking of which, he is really evil in this film. I mean if you thought you have seen his full wickedness in the first part you are so wrong. This man really is unpredictable and bad to the bone. His heart has been, you might say, destroyed by the dark side of the force, which is composed mainly of fear and hate.\nYoda is though important not that much of a main character, than you'd expect. He is just the person who is responsible for the \u0091upbringing' of the Jedi knights and who has been responsible for that for about 800 years. Although he seems quite useless and strange at the beginning, he actually is quite smart and helpful for Luke in this Episode in which Luke sees his connection with the Force reach a higher level. While Luke and Yoda prepare for battle Han and Leia are just making time fly by with a lot of jokes and action. I really must say here that Harrison Ford is great as Han Solo, who in this Episode (again) delivers most of the jokes. He is quite the scoundrel (as Princess Leia rightly noticed) and he is by far my most favorite character in the whole series, for his one \u0096 liners and his conversations with Princess Leia will always be remembered by me. My other favorite comedian from the first film (C \u0096 3PO) is not on such a roll as in the first one, but he still is pretty funny. The fact that Han Solo is my favorite character does not mean I do not like Luke, or I do not sympathize with him. It is just that if I wanted to be a character in Star Wars I would want to be Han Solo, because I think he is coolest and because I think if I could be someone in this Saga I could be Han Solo.\nBesides all that, there happens something in this Star Wars film, that is well known and remembered by all fans of the Saga and it is something I do not want to spoil for anyone of you who has not seen this film (if there are such persons). All of the fans will know what I'm talking about and I think that is the biggest and most important event of the whole saga and by far the most touching one too. It brought tears to my eyes when I saw it again, something I would not have expected. It was just done so well, I really must applaud everyone who took part in that scene and of course George Lucas and John Williams, who in my eyes is the god of Scores.\nWatch, be blown away, surprised and moved.\nMay the force be with you\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085\u0085always.\n9 out of 10", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "The Saga continues...", "date": "2000-12-25T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0175131", "sentiment score": [0.0029, 0.011, 0.0836, 0.6622, 0.2403]}, {"content": "GEORGE LUCAS has inspired all of us STAR WARS lovers with STAR WARS: EPISODE IV - A NEW HOPE in 1977, in 1980 he then brought us STAR WARS: EPISODE V - THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK. THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK (second in the STAR WARS TRILOGY) is a much darker film, with more drama, romance and evil. Being a more dramatic film is actually quite heart warming at times, JOHN WILLIAM's fantastic musical score and the actors of the film have helped a lot to make the dramatic scenes...dramatic.We see a lot more of LUKE SKYWALKER's (well acted by MARK HAMILL) development as a JEDI KNIGHT and education of the FORCE. A new character is introduced in this film and his name is...YODA who is a GREAT JEDI MASTER, one of the most interesting characters in the holy trilogy. YODA grabs the eye of the audience with his short and funny appearance and astonishing JEDI powers. The elements of the FORCE in this film are much more interesting and inspiring than what we see in the other two STAR WARS movies, with uplifting scenes like LUKE's education of the FORCE from YODA.One of the many highlights of THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is the blossoming romance between HAN SOLO (amaZingly performed by HARRISON FORD) and PRINCESS LEIA (played sweetly by CARRIE FISHER). LEIA's sweet, innocent yet tough personality miXes well with HAN's scoundrellish style.THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK being the DARKER film of the trilogy, has more evil within, which means there is more of the dark lord of the sith...DARTH VADER (played by DAVID PROWSE and the voice of JAMES EARL JONES). VADER uses his powers much more effectively here, he dominates the movie and shows no mercy.Another good mention is the SPECIAL EFFECTS, they are actually a little more dazzling than the EFFECTS in the first film, THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK won a special OSCAR for the VISUAL EFFECTS.If you haven't seen THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK I suggest you have a look at it and see what you think, I think anyone who's anyone should enjoy it, but if you haven't seen STAR WARS: EPISODE IV - A NEW HOPE, I strongly suggest you see that before STAR WARS: EPISODE V - THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK.THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is easily the best in the HOLY TRILOGY and one of the best movies ever made, well that's what I think anyway...I rate it a 10/10!

This one moves much faster than STAR WARS. Irvin Kershner is a much better storyteller than George Lucas. I still wonder why he chose not to direct this one and leave it in the hands of someone else. It's the same thing Steven Spielberg directing all of the Indiana Jones films. But I'm happy Lucas made that choice. This movie probably wouldn't have turned as good as it did. It's hard to describe what's so good about this movie and the way it makes you feel as you're watching it. The most important feeling it gives me is the sense of wonder. The space battles are truly breathtaking, and are better than anything else you see in movies today. I think it's safe to say that they truly don't make them like they used to. Hollywood forgot that the most important thing in an action & adventure film is caring about the people who are in danger and creating interesting characters. I don't think we'll ever see another movie like TESB again.In conclusion, simply GO SEE THIS MOVIE NOW.

Everything really came together here; so much so, that even George Lucas didn't change that much for the Special Edition, and what he did change only served to enhance the greatness that was already there. Probably the most notable difference between this one and the original Star Wars was in the writing, by the late Leigh Brackett and the then-neophyte Lawrence Kasdan. Brackett had a great way with a putdown, but not to the point of simply being snarky. Lines like \"I'd just as soon kiss a Wookie!\"\" I can easily arrange that; you could use a good kiss!\" serve as punctuation, and not the entire point of the film. This is why irony is dying its currently slow and painful death: a lack of skill and judgement in the use of insults, sarcasm, and other putdowns. This film has the great banter of an old Bogart-Bacall film, which also gave it an edge back in 1980, when so few intelligent films were being released. When the best banter of the year is coming from a space opera, that's pretty dire, but I digress. To critics of my point of view, yes this film is a downer, but that's what makes it so great. As the middle act, it shouldn't have a happy ending, and that's what will be so cool about Episodes II and III.

For sheer emotional power, this one has got them all blown out of the water.The first time I saw any of the Star Wars movies was when I was laid up at home after having my wisdom teeth removed the summer before my senior year in high school. The movies just blew me away, but not having time to get overly attached to any of them, I decided that the Empire Strikes Back was the best, for many reasons. We get more plot in this movie than in any of the other three. There isn't necessarily as much action as the more exciting Return of the Jedi, nor is it all as new and visually exciting as A New Hope, but the story is more important here than all that extra stuff.When the original Star Wars came out, people were so blown away by the special effects that no one really noticed what a bad movie it was. Not that it was a terrible movie, but the dialogue was terrible, the acting was atrocious, and the direction was, well, choppy. It was a great movie, but very badly made. Does this ring a bell? Sounds almost exactly like what we have been hearing about the Phantom Menace, doesn't it?Return of the Jedi was a much better movie than A New Hope. All the actors had gotten a little better. It was a very different cast than in the original. The action was more intense, the story was wrapping up, and we got one final titanic battle with the Empire. Special effects technology had gotten better as well. The biggest problem with the movie was how long-winded it was. How many ways can the emperor phrase the same statement? You'll have to watch it to find out.Which brings me to The Empire Strikes Back. The action wasn't as intense, the acting wasn't a whole lot better, and loyal Star Wars fans got ticked off at how cute Yoda was. There's really no pleasing some people, you know? They reacted the exact same way with the Ewoks and Jar Jar Binks. Amazing. Anyway, with all these problems, why go see the movie? The answer: here is where the plot thickens. Just when it seemed that the Rebellion had gotten the Empire on the run, the Empire comes back and just about crushes their best hopes. We get the shocking truth about Darth Vader's identity (well, it was shocking when the movie came out...I don't think anyone who has even heard of Star Wars doesn't know it by now). We get crucial hints to the relationship between Luke and Leia. You get murder, betrayal, and a truly terrifying encounter in the swamps of Dagobah (hint: not Yoda).

Lucas, as witnessed by most of his movies, including the latest \"Phantom Menace,\" is a genius at creating astonishing imageries and forming a spectacular visual setting for the storyline to work through. However, as far as storytelling goes, Irwin Kershner does so much better.There are two reasons why this should be considered the best of all three; oh no wait, four, if you count \"The Phantom Mess,\" which I'm still bitter about for the fact that it will forever remain as a part of the Star Wars saga -- one drop of ink will make the entire vat of water black, and that's what happened. Anyway, the first reason: The storytelling is amazing. It was appropriately paced and appropriately lengthy. It does much better development of later plot lines than any of the other movies. The romance between Solo and Leia, for example, is done ever so gently and craftily. Luke is finally acting like a decent actor, as his character goes through major transformation from a reckless, brash jedi wannabe to a man whose identity was completely turned upside down. And what about Darth Vader, the greatest villain in cinematic history? You see him here more as a guile, manipulative, tactical, and extremely intelligent character than Episode IV, where he was much more machinelike and brute.And to me, the ending of this movie had so much more drama than the other two; oh, I mean three, I guess (grr...). One of the most captivating, significant, and shocking lines in movie history, \"Luke, I am your father!\" still sends shivers and jolt through my body. This is where everything is revealed, and all of the questions presented implicitly in the first Star Wars are answered.Second, this was simply the most difficult one to make, and you have to give due credit to writers, directors, and produces for that (yes, that includes Lucas). This transition is done ever so perfectly, and that is why I consider this movie a notch better than all others. Well, that is, if you don't by the fact that it is flat-out the best movie anyway.If you have not seen any Star Wars movies yet. Start watching from Episode IV, NOT I!

I mean, they're rubbish, surely? Yet all sorts of cod psychology goes up to justify what really are just Cowboys and Indians in space. Take a look at this religious analogy of The Phantom Menace:\"A man wearing a shawl, sporting long hair and a beard travels through a town collecting disciples. After many Biblical encounters they meet a man with the appearance of a horned devil who carries a Staff horizontally, like a cross. This is ultimately what kills the man, though his death helps to save his disciple. He dies so that his disciple might live.\" This is a description of the basic events of the film, and attention is also drawn to the fact that there are three generations of man in the film (Qui-Gon Jinn, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Anakin), like the Father, Son and Holy Ghost. And what is Phantom another word for?In all honesty, that Christian analogy of the fourth Star Wars film isn't genuine - I made it up in two minutes while shopping for groceries. But it just shows how easy it is to craft a pseudo-intellectual subtext into what is a crass, sfx-crammed movie and palm it off as genuine critique. While even the most blinkered are shaky on Phantom's appeal, the fact that Star Wars makes a regular Top 10 appearance in the IMBd chart, trouncing even such greats as Citizen Kane, goes to show, to my mind, that people are scared to disagree with popular opinion.As a film, Star Wars isn't spectacular. The direction is average, at best, while acting, and especially dialogue (George Lucas' major weak point) are one-dimensional. So this would leave you to believe it must be great science fiction then. It isn't. \"Fetch the mind probe\" utters Darth Vader at one point, without any hint of irony. Childish and vapid, this dumbed-down, popcorn Sci-Fi pales, surely, when compared with such greats as 2001, Planet of the Apes or A Clockwork Orange? Yet this \"emperor's new clothes\" effect even sticks to the sequels, causing the noxious \"Return of the Jedi\" to surf irksomely around the top 100.Which brings us to The Empire Strikes Back. The only Star Wars film to date that jettisons formulaic plotting, comfortable in the fact that it follows a movie and it knows a movie will succeed it. Put simply, sandwiched in between \"Hope\" and \"Jedi\", Empire doesn't require the luxuries of a beginning or end, so is essentially one big middle. This can be off-putting at first glance, particularly an unresolved climax which can leave the viewer feeling like they've been cheated. Yet this is, by Star Wars standards, sophisticated and depth-filled, a massive slap in the face for George Lucas who had little input into this dark instalment. Though he supplies the story, the dialogue is given a human, more adult edge by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan, while Irvin Kershner's direction jettisons the \"point and shoot\" fixations of \"Phantom Menace\" for genuine cineramic sweeps.Strangely, with it's blood and mutilations, \"Empire\" wasn't given a \"PG\" certificate. But the internal nature of good/evil and the symbiosis between Luke and Vader (Mark Hamill, with the better direction, even threatening to act on occasion), lend this one a worthwhile backbone that means you don't \"have to pretend you're a kid again\" in order to enjoy it.The most sophisticated and depth-filled Star Wars film, infinitely better than anything that followed, and leagues ahead of it's merely-average predecessor, it is quite beautifully filmed and the only one of the four that will always hold surprises on any number of repeated viewings.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 5}, "heading": "The Empire's New Clothes Strike Back", "date": "1999-12-22T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0175058", "sentiment score": [0.1064, 0.2737, 0.2328, 0.2866, 0.1005]}, {"content": "STAR WARS EPISODE V - THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is an excellent sequel to the original movie.

We all know the film(s). So if you're looking for a movie description, get out of the cave and go see it like the rest of mankind has. The rest can read on. Now, I'm no pro critic, but I do tend to look at things with a broad mind and try to capture the universal sense in everything. First, as far as \"pros\" are concerned, this IS the best of the 3. Phantom doesn't count. Not bad but not the Stars Wars I grew up with and love. Second, most true fans are in agreement that ESB is the best as well (myself included). This is also probably my favorite movie of all time. What is the point to this comment then? I really wish I could know the age and background of some of these people making comments. It says a lot. I'll admit when I saw ROTJ back in '83 ( I'm 26 now), I thought it ruled. I still love it, but time has changed me and what made a great movie back then isn't the same as what makes a great movie now. (THE FOLLOWING ARE GENERALIZED, MADE UP COMMENTS BY ME WHICH GIVE A CONCENSUS ON THE MATTER IN QUESTION) When I see comments like \"ROTJ or HOPE or PHANTOM (God for bid) was better because it had more spaceships, more fighting, action\", I just roll my eyes. THAT makes a movie?? I think not. Or others saying ESB started well (battle on Hoth) but lost steam because it wandered off in character development(luke and yoda, han and leia, vader's obsession) or something like that. PLEASE! \"OH NO! is that a STORY getting in the way of my eye-candy!!\" I'll bet most people who say things like that are either kids or people who think \"Goodfellas\" is a bigger feat than the \"The Godfather\" because it had \"more action\", thought Titanic was a stupid, mushy love story...or worse, are narrow-minded enough to reduce \"Godfather\" to a mere gangster movie. Open your eyes!! Neither of the other insallments in the trilogy compare to the ESB's deapness, character development or suspense. Though Hope is nice mix of its sequels qualities. Great movie! Don't get me wrong! The human soul loves a struggle. win or lose. In fact, not \"winning\" makes it all the more poignant.But the Rebels didn't really LOSE. They narrowly avoided disaster. Had Luke been caught or killed, true victory would have gone to the Dark Side and the Emperor...the true Evil is story. And all hope would have been lost. For as long as the Dark Side lives, the Rebels could never truly win. Also, if DiCaprio had lived in Titanic, the impact on us would have been weaker. See what I mean? In conclusion, I have been one of the trilogy's biggest fans for 20 years. I love them all BUT I'll be the first to crititize them when compared with eachother. And in true artistic, refined cinema quality, ESB is unsurpassed. It does it all. Makes you laugh, cry, cheer, mourn, wonder and most importantly-FEEL. Sure, if you're not in touch with your feelings and refuse to be overcome with emotion because it's \"wimpy\" then the extent of your movie appreciation will be razzle-dazzle action and special effects. ESB has all that plus a lot more. Watch for the next 2 films. They will be better than Phantom for that reason.Especially the next one-a winding, complex epic full of ups and downs, tension, a romantic subplot( anakin and the queen with obi-wan in the mix)and an unpredictable ending. Sound familiar?? The third will be the darkest of all episodes. Apocolyptic. Remember the state of the galaxy when HOPE starts compared to Phantom!!

I think the first one was spectacular, an invitation to a fantasy world unlike any you have witnessed before or since. A very good first act, a very good introduction.But EMPIRE STRIKES BACK, in my opinion, is the best in the trilogy. Why? Let me break it down:1) Yoda. What more can I say? An ancient alien midget. A wisecracking Jedi Master. Where Han Solo gives us the irony of the series, Yoda gives us the muppet-ized hilarity of it. 2) Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian. The only brotha in the future it looks like, but the dude is bad. He also gets more acting skills and character conflict here than he does in RETURN OF THE JEDI.3) Han Solo and Princess Leia. It's so funny when you look at STAR WARS: A NEW HOPE, and you think that she loves Luke. Han and Leia are so cute here. Bickering, fighting, kissing, and in the end, admitting of their true feelings. And Han always knew. What a lovely intergalactic romance.4) We first learn of Darth Vader's true identity and his relation to Skywalker.5) Awesome light sabre showdown between Vader and Luke that served up what we couldn't get from Vader and Obi-Wan's confrontation in HOPE. Unfortunately, it was rehashed into an overlong, boring one in JEDI, inserted between an even more boring starship battle.6) Oh, and speaking of starship battles. There are none! I think these are the main flaw of all the film containing them. They are cool to witness for the first few minutes, but they go on and on without doing anything different or interesting within the long time.7) Luke loses his hand. Throughout EMPIRE, you feel this dark dread, but this is the icing on the cake. A lost battle of Luke's. But the war is not over.8) The set pieces are out of this world. The icy snow in the beginning. The misty, marshy swamp of Yoda's home. The heavenly blissful City in the Clouds. Even the Death Star looks better than the last one! Not to mention Darth's suit looks MUCH better, as do R2D2 and C3P0, most likely to do with the gross earned from the first one.9) There are so many cool creatures and machines here. Like the elephant-like tanks in the beginning or the llama-like creatures used for horses around the snowy desert.There is a flaw however. A very annoying one, in fact. Chewbacca moans too much! You get so tired as he goes on and on about the desperate situation. I guess it was meant to go with the ongoing dread and unease you feel throughout the film.

I've seen hundreds of movies in my life. When it comes to me and film, there's no genre I don't like and a movie has to have a lot of annoying qualities for me to dislike it. So I'm quite easy to please when it comes to the cinema. I know I haven't answered your question yet but bear with me.There was a time before I saw Star Wars and at that point I never really saw a movie that I didn't like. But once I first witnessed the adventures in that galaxy far, far away, my imagination (for the very first time) was actually pulled from reality and into this \"space opera\". I've never really been one for fantasy. In fact to this day, I can't quite understand the hoopla surrounding Harry Potter or the Lord of the Rings. But for some reason I can't really explain, these movies did it for me.You see, the (original) Star Wars trilogy for me is what really made me look at movies as more than just something to keep you entertained on a rainy day. At this point on, it was the basis of comparison to all the films I've seen in my life. I have yet to see a movie that I like better and I doubt I ever will because when it comes to MY taste in movies, this trilogy is as perfect as it gets.Now that I've totally gotten over my little Star Wars love fest there, let me go on to explain why The Empire Strikes Back is my favorite.I didn't see Star Wars until I was 15 so I wasn't one of those kids who grew up with it. Although if I knew then what I knew now, I'm sure it would be different. Anyway, I started seeing all this commotion about it's Special Edition re-release in 1997. It was obvious that there was something special about these movies that stood the test of time. So I went into the basement and found my dad's old Beta copies of the trilogy and decided to check them out. (I'm glad I kept my old Beta VCR, heheh) I popped in the original film and suddenly a whole new world of film was opened up to me. (But that's a whole other story.) I was so captivated by the magic of the original film, that I was kind of afraid to watch the sequels as I was afraid they would be inferior. How do you live up to that kind of masterpiece? I've never second guessed a movie since that day.So the time came to watch The Empire Strikes Back. I wanted to see the continuing adventures of Luke Skywalker, Han Solo and Princess Leia and see if they could really bring down the evil Darth Vader. They blew up the Death Star already I thought they won! Until this point, I thought Star Wars was just this happy tale of good triumphing over evil. Well...I was blown away to see Luke attacked by the Wampa Ice Creature when the movie started, the AT-AT Walkers demolishing the rebel base on Hoth, Han Solo frozen in carbonite before the eyes of those who loved him and Darth Vader revealing Luke Skywalker's true parentage. (Of course, I already knew that, but everyone knew even if they didn't see the movies.) At the end, the bad guys won. You don't really see that in a lot of movies, because it wouldn't work. Unless you're creating a trilogy, that just doesn't sit well with audiences. If I saw RoboCop and at the end he was blown to pieces, I would be disappointed. But here it works, because you knew there was another movie coming and there was time to make everything all right.This movie has everything a film buff could love. It has action, humor, romance and characters that I haven't been so in love with until I saw Trainspotting. However, that's a completely different type of film.By the time it was all over, I realized that this film had more of an impact on me emotionally than the original film did. At the end of the first film I found myself cheering for the characters. At the end of this one I found myself worrying about them and hoping that it would all be all right.The Star Wars saga is, and will always be my favorite saga of all time. Because even if I'm having a bad day at work or one of my friends gets mad at me for saying something stupid or a girl decides she's finally had enough of me, the Star Wars saga will always be there to bring back my sanity. Heheh.And that's why this is my favorite movie of all time. 10/10", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "My favorite film of all time.", "date": "1999-10-28T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0175045", "sentiment score": [0.0283, 0.0678, 0.1186, 0.3461, 0.4391]}, {"content": "`It avoids having the standard shoot-'em-up ending,' says a friend of mine, `by not having an ending.' I suppose this is what most people think, but all the same the film manages to form a satisfying whole; or at least, a whole that satisfies me. I'm therefore inclined to think it DOES have an ending. Obviously, I can't discuss this without giving things away to those few who don't know what happens. If you're one of those few, then believe me: your ignorance is precious enough to be worth guarding until you see the film. Stop reading now.After the surprise attack on the rebel base, Luke Skywalker splits with Han, Leia, et al. Han's party gets away first (is it just me, or is the shot of Luke watching the Falcon flying off while he stands stranded on the ground, a poignant one?), but thereafter they face one narrow escape after another, while Luke slinks off quietly and safely to train with Yoda.The training scenes are many and Yoda talks a great deal of rubbish. But somehow it doesn't matter. The film is ambivalent in its attitude towards Yoda, anyway. Our sympathy clearly lies with the entirely non-spiritual concerns of Han, Leia and the adolescent Luke. The main story concerns the understanding that builds between Han and Leia. In the end they are honest with one another; and if Han's being frozen and shipped back to Tatooine is the price to pay for this, well, it's the price to pay. It was very important NOT to end with the dashing rescue that opens `Return of the Jedi', which would be dramatically beside the point. Instead we end with the promise that the rescue will some day occur. That's enough.As for Luke: he abandons Yoda to rescue Han and Leia, and achieves NOTHING WHATEVER. This was my favourite touch. All five Jedis - Luke, Obi-Wan, Yoda, Vader, and the Emperor - find that their conflicting instincts are all entirely wrong. The film is really about the temporary triumph of human impulses over the mystical Force. Luke's human idealism is vindicated, but his supernatural powers, just this once, are not.When George Lucas gave his Star Wars trilogy a fresh coat of varnish in 1997 he felt he had to justify the expense by making needless changes. You'll notice he made precious few changes to episode V. There just wasn't room. He added a few extra shots of the ice monster, which of course weakened that one scene; but even with those changes in place the Special Edition is virtually identical to the original edition. Since Lucas was so keen on making changes wherever he could this is obviously a tribute to the tightness of the story and the direction. It's also a tribute to the perfection of the original special effects, more innovative than the effects in the first Star Wars movie and better than the effects in any subsequent one.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 314, "votes": 400}, "heading": "It's NOT the darkest of the trilogy - it's the most mature", "date": "1999-10-26T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0175044", "sentiment score": [0.0195, 0.1524, 0.395, 0.3874, 0.0458]}, {"content": "Sequel to Star Wars starts out hot, becomes talky and loses steam in plot entanglements.

The Empire Strikes Back blows that away. A New Hope and The Empire Strikes back, to me, are about equal in their greatness, but for different reasons. While A New Hope was great because it was the first that broke new ground, The Empire Strikes back is great because it broke new ground while having an almost entirely different story, mood, and flavor than it's predecessor.The acting in The Empire Strikes Back is superior to A New Hope. Mark Hamill definitely got better at acting, and really got into his wide-eyed, impatient, trying to become a Jedi character. Harrison Ford put more depth into Han Solo, making him more complex than just a shady smuggler. Carrie Fisher gave a new dimension to Princess Leia by showing her attraction to Han Solo, and the way she shows it. And of course, David Prowse/James E. Jones as Darth Vader, giving one of the most earth shattering revelations in a motion picture saga. Anthony Daniels (who I forgot in my review of A New Hope) gives more comic relief to the movie with C-3PO. An interesting new addition is Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissan. As Solo gets more complex, we were given a new character who's shady background made for a shaky alliance with the other characters. Also, who could forget Frank Oz puppeting Yoda, who has almost become a modern philosopher for our time.\nThe story and special effects of Empire blow away what A New Hope had already created as top notch. The models are much more detailed a realistic and they serve the story even more. I can remember as a kid being scared of the Imperial Probe Droid, which reminded me of a spider for some reason. The story is better with a darker mood. Empire is really the heart of the story, going further into the mysteries of the Force and character development and backgrounds. There is a sense of dread as Darth Vader talks to the Emperor, who is really orchestrating all of these events. Also, Darth Vader's revelation at the end is shocking if you have never seen the movie before.The Empire Strikes back relied less on a large action scene and instead has many little ones with a great lightsaber duel at the end (although it is nothing compared to the lightsaber duel in The Phantom Menace). Empire adds on to the modern mythology that A New Hope started and 'is' the best sequel ever. I personally think it is the best out of all of the Star Wars movies, although it is hard to choose.

Out of all the 4 Star Wars films I think that it is the second best of the lot. what annoys me is how unanimously most reviewers automatically point out that Return of the Jedi is the worst of the series.(Many even say that the childish film, TPM is better than ROTJ???!!huh???!!!!!!) To be quite frank, WHY?After reading surprising reviews from critics and fans alike I feel like it is necessary to point out why ROTJ is better than ESB:1)First of all, except for the \"I am your father\" it was not as emotional and sentimental as Return of the Jedi. Sure the \"I am your father\" statement was a surprise, but I get tears in my eyes when Luke reveals to his sister the truth about how they are siblings. But even that pales compared to the last 40 minutes of the movie which is an extremely dark confrontation between Luke/Darth Vader/Palpatine. Darth Vader's final redemption is just the most touching/meaningful scene out of all the Star Wars movies. And the \"I am your father\" statement just does not have as much sting as \"Father... Father I will not leave you..\" and then Anakin dies.. or even \"You have failed your highness, I am a Jedi like my father before me.\"2)Has anyone ever thought how silly it was for Luke to learn how to become a near Jedi after one afternoon and nearly defeat Vader? Come on, he did not even know how to handle a lightsaber before he met Yoda.. All of a sudden he is doing all those impressive flips and swashbuckling moves? Give me a break. Or how about knowing how to use the force to get to Bespin? How? A Jedi that can barely use the force to lift pebbles. Hello?3) This movie was slower paced. I must agree that some of the sequences in the asteroid belt seemed to drag at times. Jedi, (the longest of the three) on the other hand gripped you for all its 133 minutes.4) Where is the big space battle? I like to see spaceships getting blown up... Is this \"Star Wars\" or \"Star Trek\"? On the other hand, the Space Battle in ROTJ is widely considered The Greatest Space Battle Ever Filmed.5) The Battle of Endor was great because it was ironic and unexpected. Everyone says how much they hate the Ewoks but the charming thing about this battle was that the Imperials were supposed to win since Palpatine had foreseen it. I was in turmoil after the line--\"Your friends over there on the Endor moon are walking into a trap.. It (the shield generator) is quite safe from your pitiful band...An entire legion of my best troops await them.. Oh! I think that the shield generator will be quite operational when your friends arrive..\" After this I thought how could the rebels possibly win when the Empire had the upper hand. When the Ewoks came and surprised everyone I was breathtaken! I always get emotional when I see the underdogs take on a much more powerful foe!Empire Strikes Back is a great movie in its own right But..

It just absolutely isn't the best. Let me tell you why.Everyone I speak to on this subject (and I try not to do it too often) invariably plays the 'dark' card in the discussion. It's the best one because it's so daaaaark, man.Leave dark for the Blade Runners and the Aliens; it's so much more at home with them. Granted, I think it's particularly effective when a previously untouchable character like Han Solo winds up getting tortured and you hear his screams. That bit is good. BUT... It's Star Wars. Darkness is all well and good but it's undone when you know there's another film coming along in which in the opening forty minutes -Han will be unfrozen -Jabba/Boba will be killed -Lando will be a fully fledged friend again.Empire is a very elaborate set up for a scenario which is undone, as we all know it will be, in the opening scene of the next movie. And when you think about it, it's not really all that dark anyway. Empire is the only one of the four films currently made, which doesn't have a major character die in it. Think about that one. And at the end, Luke's recovered and they're basically ready to kick some Empirical butt. It's faintly optimistic. Dark? Ridley Scott need not feel threatened.So there you go. This movie is good. Very entertaining (even if some of the Yoda bits put me to sleep). But at the end of the day. I think it's atmosphere sticks out like a sore thumb.

But it is still George Lucas who's in full command. Key elements are (or were) beefed up to maximum \"force\", which is very noticable throughout. The simple layout of the story is still STAR WARS, now with a plot that thickens into greater epic dimensions. Continuing the story in motion is a brilliant thought. You just never call this a sequel! Characters have much more to their integrity than the previous film, with Yoda as a new addition. Luke Skywalker remains the powerful hero, but his interest with Yoda adds to his legacy along with the revealing truth about Darth Vader. Han Solo and Princess Leia have some touchy chemistry in-between the action (finally!). R2-D2 remains likeable, but you've got to look at C-3PO! What happened to him? We've come to know more about the cast, that is if you aren't careless to see EPISODE FIVE for the first time in your life.Like I said before, this next installment has much more. More speed, more intense combat battles, a more thundering orchestrated soundtrack by John Williams, and more special effects. Sights of objects that float in the air looked unbelievable (for the time).

First thing to know: \"The Empire Strikes Back\" is NOT a sequel. A standard \"sequel\" is simply the same or similar characters from one movie put in the same or similar situation to the one of the original movie, which is complete without any sequel (Jurassic Park, Speed). \"The Empire Strikes Back\" was pre-planned, and while \"Star Wars\" did seem like a complete story by itself, that was a result of creator George Lucas' uncertainty of whether or not they'd be given the opportunity to complete his saga of stories. \"The Empire Strikes Back\" did an excellent job as the film following \"Star Wars: A New Hope\", because it strived toward the same excellence the first one achieved, while the mood of this chapter contrasted that of the first entirely. The first one definitely had a lighter sort of mood to it, as far as the action among the rebels. This film concentrates more on the war itself, and how tough it is on the rebellion. It also has more establishment of the imperials and their ruthlessness, which definitely adds a darker tone to it. Score composer John Williams helps give this feeling to the film, with the now famous Imperial March that is so closely associated with villain Darth Vader (James Earl Jones). For a mood this dark, there sure is a lot of really nice scenery in the film, from the glaciers of the planet Hoth to the spanning cloudscape of Bespin. The special effects remain as amazing as those in \"A New Hope\", and have been re-done with a \"Special Edition\" as well as the first one, although not as much has changed in this film. The acting is also just as good as it was in the first one, with the addition of Yoda (Frank Oz) and Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). The emotion of this film definitely surpasses those in \"A New Hope\", with the characters' personalities and relationships explored more deeply, such as between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), and even Luke (Mark Hamill) and Darth Vader, who for the first time have an actual face-to-face confrontation with each other in the unforgettable lightsaber duel. This film is even more suspenseful and action-packed, with an incredible climax and other very high points as well. Of all the intense and breathtaking aspects of this film, the one that everyone has remembered since, and will be remembered for as long as \"Star Wars\" itself, is the revelation by Vader to Luke, which most people already know by now. If you are one of the very few who don't, don't do anything until you see this film (and the first one, too) and find out from the movie, not from some loud-mouthed friend, the way many of us did. As hard as it would be to make a film as great as \"A New Hope\" after it changed the standards of filmmaking forever, this film definitely meets and surpasses the first one. It will also leave you hanging for the trilogy's final film, \"Return of the Jedi\" (1983), which also does not disappoint in any way.

It was the first movie I really cared about--its offbeat and dark atmosphere is still a treat--and it introduced me to a wide range of cinema. Few blockbuster movies are as unconventional and audacious. Unlike the other two Star Wars movies, ESB can be taken seriously or not taken seriously at all and still be thoroughly enjoyed.Empire is the only movie of the series in which the acting is uniformly solid. Despite their individual flaws, all three lead actors give convincing (if not quite Oscar caliber) performances. Irvin Kershner, the man who directed this second chapter of the Star Wars Trilogy, was a much better director of actors than either George Lucas or Richard Marquand.The script, penned by the late, great Leigh Brackett (The Big Sleep, Rio Bravo) and Lawrence Kasdan (Body Heat, Raiders of the Lost Ark) is the best written and most nuanced of the entire series. With Kershner's help, the two screenwriters deepen the motivations of the movie's characters. The effect of this is two edged: Han, Leia, Luke and the other characters in the series move closer to us and become mythic heroes at the same time. In ESB, simple facial expressions convey a lot more about the characters than a ton of deadweight dialogue in Star Wars and Return of the Jedi.Empire's pacing is brilliant. Kershner unleashes the excitement early with two unforgettable action sequences, slows the movie down with a beautiful legato middle act, and then picks up the pace again with a moving and fast paced climax.The movie's editing and cinematography are nearly flawless. Like Pauline Kael once said, Empire's cascading and visceral images stay with the viewer long after he or she has finished watching the movie.The Empire Strikes Back has a soulfulness and emotional richness that the other two Star Wars movies lack. Every frame is packed with beautiful, flowing visuals. The picture is a precise, yet heartfelt piece of moviemaking---something that children and adults can appreciate and love.\nEmpire Strikes Back carries most of the emotional load of the Star Wars Trilogy, yet does so with such subtlety and grace that it is often overlooked in the greater scheme of the \"Star Wars Myth\". In fact, I would go so far as to say that what transpired in this middle chapter of the series allowed the series to gain \"mythic\" resonance with the public.And after all of that it's still ripping good fun.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 2}, "heading": "The best of the Star Wars Trilogy by far.", "date": "1998-12-21T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0175094", "sentiment score": [0.0018, 0.0041, 0.0181, 0.4094, 0.5666]}, {"content": "Not since The Godfather Part II, has a sequel lived up to its name and then some!!!

The first film I saw was to have a profound effect on my life: The Empire Strikes Back.No other film can, and never will compare to this motion picture. It is simply the finest film committed to celluloid that I have ever witnessed. The first thing you notice about it is the rich characterisation. Han Solo, Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, Darth Vader etc. are all superbly realised and the characterisation goes deeper into their emotions and psyche than 'Star Wars: A New Hope' and we care even more about the characters as their journey continues. The visual style of 'Empire' is awesome. Irvin Kershner's direction is masterful and we see beautiful sights, such as the cold but immense landscape of Hoth, or the inspiring sunsets of Bespin. Every setting, scene, vehicle, weapon etc. looks so realistic and some of the things you see in this film in the background or for a short time (such as the AT-AT walkers) would be used as a centerpiece for a lesser movie. The narrative moves along well and the story is extremely well plotted. Some of the scenes in the film are filled with such grandeur (Yoda raising Luke's ship from the swamp, Han and Leia sharing a final kiss as Han is frozen, Darth Vader revealing who he really is) and they bring tears to my eyes every time. The ending is a shock to anyone seeing it for the first time (and still, sometimes, for veterans such as me) and thankfully, we don't have to wait three years this time.Looking nowadays, at films such as Jurassic Park and Titanic, none of these movies have been or are likely to be embedded in our culture as much as the Star Wars trilogy has. Films like 'Empire' and the two other chapters, 'Star Wars: A New Hope' and 'Return of the Jedi' are one of a kind movies; they bring out fears, give us a sense of adventure and grandeur that only a few films have (such as 'Jaws', the 'Indiana Jones' trilogy, 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind'.
