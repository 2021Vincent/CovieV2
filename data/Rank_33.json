This was my first Hitchcock experience and I enjoyed it. Why the 4 out of 5 rating? It's hard to say. I know that my review doesn't change anything about the film's status and perhaps I just haven't grown the maturity to accept older films. I thought the movie was sleek, well-performed, especially Anthony Perkins playing Norman Bates, the atmosphere and a memorable score.The writing was solid as I really didn't see the twist coming. We were led to believe that the \"mother\" is the \"psycho\" and Norman just cleans up after her mess but in the end, it was the same person! The interaction between Norman and other characters were quite well written and still respectable and unsettling after all these years. Norman Bates was definitely my favorite character and he was very well written. I am sure many characters down the road have been inspired him but his attachment to his mother, his unassuming demeanor, but with a sense of creepiness and social ineptitude, all were excellently portrayed by Perkins.While I understand the cultural significance of the death scenes, I have to say I found them slightly comical. I was more on edge leading up to it but seeing how the victims died actually was slightly disappointing. But both of those scenes were pretty terrifying and it got the job done. I also learned about the transition shots that Hitchcock used which I first encountered with Vince Gilligan. I think this movie would feel so much better if I watch it the second time. I also got distracted couple times so I regret not being able to fully immerse myself in it.

But the film was just too predictable and had too many laughs where they were not supposed to be.I mean seriously. I can't speak for the crowds in 1960, but if anyone watches this for the first time today, it's pretty obvious where this entire picture is going after we go to the motel for the first time. The title itself is clue enough (he's a \"psycho\" after all) but really, I can't see anyone not guessing the big 'secret' of this flick way before the ending.The film's main characters are cast superbly. Janet Leigh looks great and sexy, keeping the film from being too boring because she's so beautiful and good on screen. And of course Anthony Perkins does a pretty decent job. He doesn't give the awe-inspiring heart-stopping performance that fans of the flick seem to think he gives, but he is very good indeed.The ingredients of the movie are put together very nicely, with the music and editing utilized for the maximum effect. Hitchcock definitely shows why he's known as such a great talent in these respects, putting it all together beautifully.Unfortunately, the film suffers from too many laughs where they aren't supposed to be. When Norman first indicated he's a little \"psycho,\" it's very funny watching him and his serious face as he gives clues he's such a nut case. With \"Mother,\" whenever \"she\" talks (and yells), it's just too funny not to laugh at it.

Whether we're talking about the famous shower scene or the frank talk about sex and Oedipal complexes or something as trivial as a flushing toilet, PSYCHO was a bonafide game changer. Prior to Hitchcock's chiller, the public's idea of a horror movie was a Vincent Price vehicle or the monster mashes made at Universal back in the 1930's. PSYCHO changed that perception forever by exposing our naked vulnerabilities.... especially in the shower.The stabbing death of Marion Crane as she's in the shower was meant to be more than just a murder. The sudden parting of the curtain represented a violation, a rape, if you will. An act of privacy such as a shower was violated in the most horrific way possible, exposing our powerlessness. One of the reasons Hitchcock shot PSYCHO in black & white was because the fake blood might look too gory on the screen. Unfortunately, PSYCHO also inspired a superabundance of inferior carbon copies and slasher flicks that offered nothing more than cheap thrills. So, in that sense, it has a lot to answer for.Although PSYCHO was the biggest gamble of Hitchcock's career, his rolling of the dice was not a do or die situation. After all, NORTH BY NORTHWEST reached the theaters, and was making everyone a truckload of money. Plus, Hitch's weekly anthology series continued to be one of the most watched programs on television. But after reading Robert Bloch's nonfiction book about serial killer Ed Gein, Hitchcock was intrigued. No one else in Hollywood thought it had any potential for success, but Hitchcock did. He went so far as mortgaging his home to finance PSYCHO, and to cut costs further he used the crew from his television series instead of his usual big screen collaborators.By now, everyone knows about the shower scene, but part of what made it so shocking in 1960 was who it was that got bumped off. Janet Leigh was a big star at the time, still big enough that her name appeared before the movie's title. Therefore it was logical for audiences to assume she'd be around for the final reel. So when Marion Crane was stabbed to death at only the forty minute mark, it left theatergoers simultaneously glued to their seats and horrified out of their wits.PSYCHO begins in Phoenix on a Friday afternoon in December where Marion Crane is spending her lunch break in a hotel room with her boyfriend Sam Loomis before returning to the real estate agency where she works. Being one of the two secretaries -the other is played by Hitchcock's daughter Patricia- Marion is privy to all cash transactions....and, of course, she has access to the money.Shortly after arriving at the office, Marion feigns illness and goes home early....and takes with her the $400,000 she was to have placed in the vault. Her plan is to leave Phoenix and drop in on Sam at his home/hardware store in Fairvale, CA. In one of the great moments in bad timing, Marion is stopped at a red traffic light waiting for it to turn green, and who should be crossing the intersection but her boss?? And he was under the impression that she at home sick in bed. \ud83d\ude2cMarion Crane would certainly make for the most appalling card player in the world, for she's not endowed with a poker face. As she's driving away from Arizona, her mind is racing a hundred miles a minute imagining all the worst case scenarios. Marion's anxiety has aroused the attention of a state trooper and an auto salesman she's traded her car with. On the verge of a nervous breakdown, she pulls off-road to the Bates motel that night during a heavy downpour.The proprietor is Norman Bates(Anthony Perkins), a strange, meek young man who's lived alone all these years with his \"mother\". After registering Marion in, the socially awkward Norman asks her to join him in the parlor for a sandwich or two. Famished, but exhausted, she accepts his offer, where they chat about mothers, mental health.....even the stuffed birds on his wall. Their conversation has convinced Marion to return to Phoenix and face the the consequences of her actions.Marion retires to her room, unaware that Norman is peeping on her through a small hole in the wall. Before turning in for the night, she steps into the shower, where Hitchcock inserts a little symbolism. When Marion turns on the tap, the running water also represents a cleansing of her sins as well as her body, but tragically that repentance comes too late. A silhouetted figure wearing a dress enters the bathroom, quickly parts the curtain and repeatedly stabs Marion to death, and then flees the crime.As Marion's lifeless body lays partially on the bathroom floor, a panicked Norman rushes to the room. After regaining his composure, Bates dutifully cleans up the crime scene, removing her body and every bit of evidence that suggests a murder took place. A week passes by, and two different people arrive at Fairvale -which is within proximity of the Bates motel- looking for the missing Marion Crane. One is her sister Lylah (Vera Miles); the other is Arbogast (Martin Balsam), a private investigator retained by Marion's employer to find her and the money she embezzled.

To this very day, Psycho is an utterly terrifying, highly enthralling and extremely suspenseful 1960s horror classic, and no, it's not just because of the iconic shower scene. It's one of those rare movie gems with strong tension and anxiety that manages to hit you or give you the chills every time you see it, but it's also a movie that gets better and better the more you watch it.Janet Leigh shines seemingly as the film's central lead as a secretary who steals $40,000 in cash from her employer's client, before going on the run and ending up checking into an isolated motel run by Norman Bates. What really keeps you glued to the seat without a doubt is Hitchcock's fabulous work as a director. During the scenes unaccompanied by music or dialogue, his very clever camerawork alone creates breathtaking moments of horror-defining terror and uncertainty. In addition to this is the cast, with solid acting skills from everyone who has large portions of screen time, but Anthony Perkins definitely gives the best performance this film has to offer, in his unforgettable role as Norman Bates.Another notable element that will strike the audience just as much as the performances and direction is the movie's excellent score, doubling the overall sense of dread and uncertainty in all the scenes that make use of soundtrack, which is composed admirably by Bernard Herrmann.

We scratch and we claw, but only at the air, only at each other, and for all of it, we never budge an inch.\"Psycho, probably the film Alfred Hitchcock is best known for, is a 1960 psychological thriller/horror movie. It's considered by many as an early masterpiece that paved the way to many films in that genre to come. The film revolves around Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a troubled woman who wishes to take off with her lover and find herself a better life. Trying to do so she gets, in a hurry, to the Bates Motel, an unpopular motel run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) in the middle of nowhere. As the film progresses, things begin to slowly go awry, more and more with every passing moment.I'd consider Psycho a film with two distinct parts - a subjective psychological dive and a more objective mystery-solving segment that sheds more light on what came before it. The first hour or so of the film, the psychological dive, is definitely more powerful to me than the rest of the film overall. The second part of the movie has some iconic moments as well, and I like it too, but it doesn't feel nearly as deep as the first one.The first part of the film is way more thought-provoking, showing how we chase what seems to us as true freedom and happiness with all our might when we can't be truly free if our mind is enslaved to inner demons and mental illness. I don't think that I get the birds as a motif fully, but I think I have a pretty good grasp there. The second part of the film is much more technical, much more tell than show, but it's still pretty good. Just a little pale in comparison.Some things about this film are absolutely excellent, though. The score is one of the best scores I've ever heard - eerie, disturbing (goes hard sometimes). Absolutely adore it. Perkins and Leigh also portray their characters perfectly, especially Perkins. Their characters are multi-faceted, intriguing, reflecting each other in interesting ways. Both of them are really top notch, and I totally love their performances.The cinematography is much more interesting in the first part of the film as well - immersive, unsettling, sometimes slightly dream-like. The second part has some visually captivating shots and moments too, but overall it's weaker in that aspect (for reasons that make sense when you think of the nature of each part, but still).I also really disliked the psychiatrist scene watching it for the first time, but rewatching made it a little better. Still annoying a bit but it's not horrible, really.Overall I'd say that Psycho is a very good film. It's not consistently unique and thought-provoking, but its first hour or so is still great, the score is amazing and the eerie, unsettling vibes are totally there. Anthony Perkins truly kills it here, too. Aged well, worth checking out.

As we all know,most modern horror movies make the killer an absolutely inhuman, grotesque, unimaginable monster in order to frighten the audience out of its wits. However, these stereotypes create a generic murderer a raving, ranting, clearly demented psychopath. One of the few memorable cinematic killers that does not adhere to these restraints and cliches .Anthony Perkins skillfully crafts his performance as Norman Bates, avoiding ranting, raving, and manic characterization. Instead ,his performance as Norman is subtle, and creepy. He is brilliant that we can know from his quiet conversations with Marion Crane amidst the stuffed birds and his performance is so wonderful that it chills the people without the unnecessary disturbing images prevalent in most modernfilms .Perkin's wonderful performance, a tight script, makes Psycho a film that will always be remembered as one of the pinnacles of the horror genre. And then,let's discuss the most exciting famous shower scene.\"How'd they do that?\" It's a question that many people have asked over the years about this frightening shower scene. Psycho shocked audiences with its infamous 45-second \"shower scene,\" a heart-stopping sequence after which nothing would ever look the same. The shower that Marion takes is meant to cleanse her sins. Unfortunately,her sins can't easily be forgiven as she is prematurely killed. The sounds at the beginning of the shower scene such as trickling of the shower are absolutely normal that do not come as a surprise. And then we get several close-up shots on Marion's face,bringing the focus on her expression. When a shadow beyond the curtain approaching her,we can see someone come through the bathroom door. However,,we cannot tell who it is because we see them through the shower curtain. The use of camera angles with both foreground and background action creates a lot of tension and suspense. Meanwhile,the sound track is used to heighten the tension. As the murderer leaves the room ,the music switches to a low pitch violin that could represent a heart beat. The music gradually gets slower and quieter,which could represents Marion's heart beat slowly coming to an end,resulting in her death.curtain. The use of camera angles with both foreground and background action creates a lot of tension and suspense. Meanwhile,the sound track is used to heighten the tension. As the murderer leaves the room ,the music switches to a low pitch violin that could represent a heart beat. The music gradually gets slower and quieter,which could represents Marion's heart beat slowly coming to an end,resulting in her death. The sequence became a demarcation line in film history. \"There were movies before the shower scene and movies after the shower scene,\" says filmmaker Alexandre O. Philippe,\"It really was a game changer.\"The shower scene is a technical term: 78 camera setups and 52 cuts, the extraordinarily labour-intensive work that went into the shower scene from Alfred Hitchcock,a sequence which took fully seven days of a 30-day schedule. This shower scene bursts with techniques of tension and impacts,which are created through Hitchcock's extensive using of camera setups,lightening,music,sound and drama. All of those aspects together create a huge atmosphere of tension,making this classic scene memorable,dramatic and revolutionary. Finally,I will tell the influence of Psycho. When Psycho came out, the horror industry of movies was merely monsters, zombies, werewolves, and vampires. So when Psycho hit screens, the audience was finally introduced to psychological thrillers. It hit with such a huge bang that the audience was shocked with fear and suspense. Psycho created what the thriller genre is today. It sliced through clique monster movies and changed it forever. Still today when you look at Norman Bates and his extremely freaky look when you see him watching the inspector's car sinking into the swamp sends chills down my spine. And when Marion Crane met her bloody demise in the middle of the movie, Hitchcock proved to everyone that this movie is very different from every other movie you have ever seen. Psycho is a phenomenal piece of film, from a master filmmaker and an equally talented cast and crew; it's a true cinematic landmark. Most importantly, Psycho is hugely influencing entire generations of filmmakers, particularly those in the horror genre. In conclusion , Psycho is made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. It's in black and white, without any blazing technicolor. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which looks like just a plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting,razor-sharp editing that we understand the creativity of this movie. The cinematography in this movie is fabulous, the music is marvelously freaky, the acting is magnificent, the story is exceptional, and everything else about the movie is great. It's definitely one of Hitchcock's best movies.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 3}, "heading": "the easy of the appreciation of Psycho", "date": "2022-12-30T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8768049", "sentiment score": [0.0819, 0.4014, 0.2978, 0.1912, 0.0278]}, {"content": "Psycho is yet another Hitchcock masterpiece.

Like many proven English makers, he'd cross the Pond, then the N. American continent to the USA's movie mecca, Hollywood, expanding his repertoire on makes like Mr-&-Mrs-Smith Rear-Window Rebecca Saboteur and Strangers-On-A-Train, eventually focusing his energies on one genre. And of his vast catalog, two films stand out, cementing his place atop the hierarchy of horror directors: Psycho (60) and The-Birds (63), both ingenious tales set in eerily everyday circumstance, the latter airing on 70s TV with frequency (What's a little eye-gauging and tortious bird behavior, anyway, right?), and Psycho, with its famous chef salad shower scene and weird mother-son dynamic, proving too graphic for censors who sometimes DID know best. But with cable's arrival (80s) and codes liberated, all of us finally got to check in the Bates Motel, assuming all risks and liabilities appurtenant (gulp).Psycho clearly crossed the line, but because it did so with style (Stefano & Bloch), its shocking visuals would change movies forever (how censors ever let it show in theaters is a small miracle, or deal made with the devil).

Whether we're talking about the famous shower scene or the frank discussion about sex and Oedipal complexes or even something as trivial as a flushing toilet, PSYCHO was a bonafide game changer. Prior to Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece, people's idea of a horror movie was some Vincent Price vehicle or the monster mashes made at Universal back in the 30s . The violence depicted in PSYCHO and the subsequent revelations hit a lot closer to home, psychologically speaking.The killing of Marion Crane as she's in the shower was meant as more than just a murder. The parting of the curtain represents a violation, a sort of rape if you will. An act of privacy such as a shower was violated in the most horrific way possible, exposing our naked vulnerabilities, whether it be literal or figurative. One of the reasons Hitchcock shot PSYCHO in black & white was because the fake blood being used might look too gory onscreen. Unfortunately, the movie also inspired a superabundance of inferior carbon copies and slasher flicks. So in that way, PSYCHO also has a lot of answer for.Although PSYCHO was the biggest gamble of Hitchcock's career, his rolling of the dice was not a do or die situation. After all, NORTH BY NORTHWEST had just reached the theaters, and was making everyone a truckload of money. And Hitch's weekly anthology series continued to be one of the most watched programs on television. But after reading Robert Bloch's nonfiction book of the same name, Hitchcock was intrigued by the real-life serial killings committed by Ed Gein, a Wisconsin farmer. No one else in Hollywood thought it had any potential for success, but Hitchcock did.

He had done some great films, with some huge stars. Gary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, James Stewart, Grace Kelly and Henry Fonda had all worked for him. In 1955, he also started \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\", a TV show with millions of viewers. But now it was 1960. The director wanted to try something new.In \"Psycho,\" Anthony Perkins plays a repressed young man named Norman Bates. He seems completely dominated by his disabled mother, but still tries to manage his run-down motel as best he can. One day, an attractive young woman (Janet Leigh) walks through the front door, setting in motion a fateful sequence of events.Unfortunately, Paramount Pictures wasn't interested in the new project. In a desperate attempt to get \"Psycho\" made, Hitchcock offered to pay for the shooting himself if the company guaranteed to distribute the finished film. And ultimately Paramount said yes. Convinced that \"Psycho\" would be a box-office flop they also agreed to Hitchcock's demand for a 60% cut of the film's (unlikely) profit.Hitchcock immediately set to work. To keep costs down, he only used personnel from his own TV series behind the cameras. And he shot the whole movie in black and white on a spare movie set. With a budget of $800,000, \"Psycho\" was the cheapest film Hitchcock ever produced.Surprisingly, the picture became a smash hit at the cinemas. Thanks to his deal with Paramount, Hitchcock personally earned over $15 million from the box office. In the coming years, \"Psycho\" also became a successful franchise with three more new films, as well as a color remake of the original.

After all these years, I've managed to find the time to give this highly rated movie a try. For a movie lover, I suppose that's shameful, hahaha. One of the reasons is just a matter of not being alive when it was released..... I mean it was made over 60 years ago, and although I do love the classics. I've just never got around to this particular one.I didn't know what to expect, really. Its reputation precedes itself, so on one hand I had high hopes and on the other, I had a feeling I wouldn't like it for some reason. Maybe that's why I have held off on watching it all this time. Nevertheless, I was pleasantly surprised and actually enjoyed it. Especially considering my mindset is different from those who watched it upon release back in 1960.My generation and others have been spoiled by this genre. What I mean by that is we have seen it all, in terms of narrative, special effects and modern approach. Sound effects / Special effects are at the forefront of thriller/horror movie production, even to this day. They have come a long way since 1960. Imagine watching any of the classic horror movies over the years without all the sound effects that come with them. They say we are all born with two fears. The fear of Falling and loud noises. Production companies have obviously caught on to this years ago, but Alfred Hitchcock set the standard and did the best with what he had at his disposal.I always think directors and filmmakers back then deserve way more praise for what they achieved under the circumstances. Producers have an easy job with all the top spec computers and a boat load of other tricks and technology they have to create the scare fest's we see nowadays. That said, It is getting harder and harder for producers to scare people easily in this day and age. This film in a way proves how much easier it was to scare people back then, as one of the reasons Alfred Hitchcock filmed in Black and white was to tone down the shower scene because it was too gory.So with that in mind, I approached this with the perspective of judging it by the era it comes from. The outcome was still impressive, and I can see why this would have been such a hit back in the day. In any case, if I hadn't been spoiled beforehand by the genre, I would probably have rated it higher. I like its originality, and I can see where some modern psychological thrillers/horrors got their influence from. I found it to be more creepy and tense rather than scary, though.Furthermore, I thought Anthony Perkins performance as \"psycho\" Norman Bates was excellent, and he probably deserved more recognition than he got. The cinematography ironically added to the tenseness and creepiness of this film, and I didn't mind it being in Black and White as it contributed to the film. Alfred Hitchcock was ahead of his time, and you have to admire his genius. With its massive reputation and my modern outlook tainting my view of it, I found it to be slightly overrated for me, but I can truly see why it is so valued.

As you might know from watching the making-of movie Hitchcock, there's a host of trivia behind the scenes of the Psycho set. From Janet Leigh's ample bosom that could barely be contained in the frame (or could it), to Hitchcock's control of his audience (from not letting them into the theater late, to specifically asking them to keep the plot to themselves), it's understandable why it was such a smash hit. Dark, gritty true crime movies weren't made very often - but they had been made. The previous year's Compulsion, starring Dean Stockwell, fit into that genre and was a precursor to the senseless crime spree of Bonnie & Clyde.While everyone would argue that Psycho ruined Anthony Perkins's career, not everyone feels that way. I actually have a friend who has never seen Psycho, and she doesn't think of Anthony Perkins the way the rest of the world does. She always calls him \"the handsome actor who sings Stephen Sondheim songs\" - I'm not kidding. But the rest of world remembers him transitioning from the sweet, nonviolent Quaker from Friendly Persuasion to Norman Bates four years later and never looking back. If you're looking for it, though, you can find a sprinkling of roles in his post-1960 career that weren't villains: Catch-22, Lovin' Molly, and Goodbye, Again.What I love most about this classic thriller is Bernard Herrmann's music. Like the greatest of themes, it sounds exactly like what it's describing. You can tell what the movie is about by just listening to the score. You hear the knife, the scream, the heartbeat, and the inner-workings of the psychotic mind. But for non-music fans, there's a lot more to love about it. The iconic Bates Motel setting, Hitchcock's careful directing, Perkins' subtle performance, and the overall creepiness that lingers in the air.

From the beginning, there is a certain unnerving tension that is established. This heightens soon in the run time and never lets up, even in the moments where characters are in no immediate danger. Hitchcock effectively uses every device available to invoke a sense of inevitable doom, from voiceovers to thoughtful lighting. Beyond his directing prowess, what highlights the movie is its performances. In the lead, Leigh presents a genuine, and therefore relatable, character. This remains true even with the couple questionable decisions she makes, as the role's internal struggles come to light because of her conflicting motivations. Where the character is ultimately left proves satisfactory for this particular story. Perkins is just as brilliant, acting with such charisma and poise. He presents an unassuming man that, at first, even seems likable. His line delivery is most impressive, as the dialogue and tones he uses evoke a suspicious atmosphere. The supporting cast is very good, too, from concerned family members to a private investigator. Every motivation is clear, making the progression of events feel entirely logical. The third act is especially so, as everything comes together in an immensely satisfying fashion. This picture absolutely delivers on its horror-thriller premise, as well, aided most notably by a fantastic score that enhances every sequence by a great deal. Still, the film does have a couple flaws. A subplot that is held onto for a good portion of the first act is oddly enough never revisited, as are there a few minor plot holes. During a couple more intense scenes, there was too much cutting around the fighting. There could have been more development into the private investigator character, too, and more emotion from certain other performances. Clearly, though, these are minor flaws, as this film was so well crafted. Do not let the black and white color be a turn off, either, as the film feels rather equivalent to a modern day thriller.

As she is fleeing she stops at Bates Motel due to heavy rain, and she is not heard from after. Detective Milton Arbogast is hired to find what happened with her and he goes missing after reaching the manor behind Bates Motel. This causes anxiety for Lila Crane (Vera Miles) and Sam Loomis (John Gavin) who investigate there to find that the owner, Norman Bates had killed them.When watching this movie, the first thing that caught my attention and immersed me was the music. There was an eeriness that the music had but nothing considered scary, however, when the murders are occurring and Norman Bates' (Anthony Perkins) identity as the killer is revealed is when the music gets to the next level to give a sense of discomfort. To be frank the music plays a big role in the discomforting effect that the movie has.Psycho has a very interesting premise and thrilling screenplay. The characters are not characters you will love and want to be like, instead they are characters who are written well enough to get you immersed into the story. The story of Marion Crane is quite intriguing and you are wondering how it is going and realized she is killed by some mysterious killer though it does feel like the maker is pointing towards Norman Bates , but after that is when Sam and Lila enter and try to piece together the information with the help of the Detective.The editing of this film is really good and obviously Alfred Hitchcock is considered master class in making such thrillers. A thriller truly relies on strong editing and the screenplay, Hitchcock definitely did this in a way that the movie is thrilling and creates a sort of discomforting atmosphere which is probably the reason why this movie is considered a classic. The eerie shots and the slowed wait for the reveal without revealing what is happening at multiple points in between.The usage of the psychiatrist at the end to just give a speech and explain the whole occurrence may seem a little unoriginal. I actually thought the reveal could have been done in a more intelligent fashion or even had us follow the questioning of Norman Bates by the psychiatrist to increase the thrilling effect created by the movie. But it was an interesting movie tool to utilize the psychiatrist to explain how Norman Bates killed his mother and her lover and took her identity in his own mind as she wanted her for himself and was aroused by multiple people as Norman and would shift to the mother identity to show the jealousy and kill those people.Overall, this is a classic thriller which shows us why Alfred Hitchcock is such a highly regarded filmmaker.

Psycho is probably his most popular film and for good reason. He knows how to manipulate the emotions of the audience and knows how to build tension through every scene. Most people will recognize the main theme and the iconic scene it's used most famously for. You want a classic thriller horror film, Psycho is where it's at.The most fascinating conflict in the film is Norman vs Mother. As the psychologist explains in the end, whenever Norman encounters a woman he was attracted to, Mother would awaken and feel jealous. It's implied that Marion was not the first to be murdered by Mother. It's interesting to see the aftermath of what was probably a series of traumatic experiences throughout Norman's life enhanced by his isolation. As Norman Bates said himself, \"we all go a little mad sometimes.\" Ironically, he seemed obliviously by the influence of his Mother's persona. The most notable aspect of the final scene is the final shot of Norman. He looks directly to the camera with a menacing smile as Mother finishes her dialogue about deceit. And for a split second, there's an overlap of Norman's face and the skull of his mother's, emphasizing the duality of the two in Norman's mind.I loved how the murders were filmed. The infamous shower scene begins as Mother approaches in shadow. Then she brutally stabs Marion and each motion of the knife is perfectly harmonized to the intense music. When the detective is murdered, we see Mother approach him with a high angle overlooking the scene. Not once do we see Mother's face until the end when the big twist is revealed. This made mother more menacing as the film tried to drop the fa\u00e7ade of Norman's innocence.Final shout out to Anthony Perkins as the ever iconic Norman Bates. He brilliantly portrayed every side to Norman - the friendly, shy Motel owner; the nervous, innocent witness; and the deranged, psychotic mother. The final shot of him looking into the camera still gives me chills.I also recommend Psycho fans to watch the Bates Motel.

Norman is first a victim then a murderer in my eyes, growing up in the shadow of his demanding and critical mother but meanwhile craving for her love and attention. The mind that houses two personalities can date back long time ago when he was struggling with his own feelings towards his own mother, along with the man his mother got involved with after his own father passed away. Without proper guidance and communication from his own mother, he got so used to keeping everything to himself that he pushed himself over that thin line of hurting more than just himself. I could even picture how he collapsed all the way to the serial killer after the matricide.2) Hitchcock is so sophisticated and observant that he knows how aloof people can be when they are too busy minding their own business or too afraid to be dragged into someone else's mess, even those who are supposed to the humble servants to their own people in a somewhat democratic society. The deputy sheriff is a quintessential example of such indifference. He wouldn't even bother to dig into the case with a second thought but simply accused Sam for his illusion-seeing problem or negated Lila's plausible deduction of the information available. I couldn't think of another reason besides the fact that he just wanted to retain his authoritative figure by brushing off all the important dots he ought to connect when people knocked on his door for help in the middle of a night. He is for sure never the first or the last policeman who takes their jobs easy peasy :)3) Despite Hitchcock's mastery in building suspense and tension, I still couldn't get my head around the connection between the first scene with the Mary's embezzlement. She was off to find an solitary island on her own, without Sam or her sister. But why so if she had said she wanted to marry Sam in the first place?

It's a truly thrilling, expertly made film that will keep you gripped, guessing and tense; it's an experience to watch, and should be seen all at once (as Hitchcock famously insisted) without spoilers.There is so much to love about this movie. The narrative is amazing; it breaks all conventions, grips the audience like a vice and refuses to let go, and will keep you tense, guessing and thrilled for its entire runtime. Its twists are truly amazing. The cinematography and direction is, of course, phenomenal. There is so much symbolism, so many little signposts throughout, and it's all shot and directed beautifully; it's an amazing viewing experience. The acting is stunning (the script equally so). Anthony Perkins as Norman steals the show and truly becomes his character; with that incredible direction and script, Norman becomes the soul of the film. The score by Bernard Hermann is a trademark of 'Psycho' and is the icing on the cake, adding so much to the film and the experience (Hitchcock said Hermann was responsible for 33% of Psycho). The film is just a masterpiece, and if you so wanted you could talk about every scene's success in great detail.I think a lesser-discussed part of 'Psycho' that I find really interesting is its constant symbolism (especially through a Freudian psychoanalytical lens) and the way Hitchcock broke the audiences' perceptions of cinema to bring something truly shocking and revolutionary. The film is rich with symbolism, used expertly not only for purposes such as foreshadowing and metaphor, but to really unpack the characters - specifically, Norman Bates. 'Psycho' was released in 1960, in the midst of the Hays Code, when antagonists were primarily black and white characters who had to be looked down upon and punished for their evil deeds; yet Norman's character is very layered and interesting, and the audience does not grow to hate him outright. Hitchcock uses constant symbolism to draw an 'antagonist' who is torn apart by real internal conflict. To slip into some psychoanalysis, he makes Norman so compelling and fascinating by having him plagued with intense conflict of his id, ego and superego. In the parlour scene, a stuffed owl is almost always framed above Norman: it symbolises his superego's presence, which is personified throughout the movie by his mother. After spying on Marion changing for his id's gratification, Norman's superego ('mother' half of his mind) shames him for his looking on another woman, convincing him that his mother would be terribly jealous, which drives him to kill her. The film is absolutely packed with this sort of fascinating symbolism. On the topic of Marion's sudden death, I admire 'Psycho' for how it truly broke audiences' subconscious ideas for how a story was meant to play out. Hitchcock shattered all expectations the audience has for stories and the protagonist during this twist, propelling the film forwards into a state of intense tension and uncertainty, achieving an amazing tone and grip on the viewer. If you get people out of their seats in the cinema, running up the aisles because they can't quite comprehend how the film breaks conventions, you're doing something right.The only issue I have ever taken with this movie is its conclusion, where things are explained in explicit terms to the audience; I admit things do need explaining, and of course this scene will come cross as heavy-handed upon rewatches, when explanations are unnecessary - but still, I've always felt the film's final twist could have been explained in less certain terms, with a little more finesse. I am also curious as to how things would have looked without the Hays Code in place (though Hitchcock's style shines in the way he creates this terrifying masterpiece without graphic violence or any other terribly immoral things that might corrupt and tarnish the glorious American people).This film is truly a classic masterpiece, phenomenal in every aspect of film-making. It is a thrilling movie that will keep you hooked and stay with you for a long while.

It is so beautifully crafted. Everything about this film, all elements are a 10/10 in my opinion. I'm gonna start with the acting; Anthony Perkins does such an amazing job at portraying Norman bates. All the small nonverbal nuances of his performance such as the clenching of his jaw or his aversion of his eyes all come together to bring out this very socially inept and nervous character who you can't help sympathise with but at the same time get a sense of despair and darkness. Not to mention his delivery of his lines during tense scenes which make you question his character and keeps adding to the suspense Hitchcock so brilliantly creates.Perkins' actual appearance is also works incredibly well for the character as he looks to be a harmless and slender motel owner but that couldn't be further from the truth. Janet Leigh plays the role of Marion Crane who ends up in trouble with the law and is on the run to escape the 'private trap' she's put herself in. Her performance is equally as good as Perkins and they both contrast greatly to eachother which once again ads to the suspense that underpins the the film. She has such a soft and articulate way of speaking, making her appear to be very intellectual which makes her slow downfall that much more devastating and shocking. The score for this film from the opening credits which runs all throughout the run time every now and then at key scenes is just so perfectly used and I genuinely feel tense hearing it on its own so when it is combined with a thrilling scene it just exponentially increases the feelings going through my head. Now don't get me started on the cinematography for this film as I could go on for ages about how visually stunning and actually groundbreaking some of the shots are. One interesting fact I like is that Psycho was the first film to show a toilet flushing and it was regarded as being vulgar at the time. Obviously there's the iconic shower scene which is famous for a reason. I believe the budgetry constraints Hitchcock had actually improved the scene for me. The blood as chocolate sauce and the sound effects of a knive stabbing a melon which works very well and definitely holds up even today as the cutaways from the action make it that more intense and disturbing as you are forced to imagine more of what is happening. The overall plot is thought provoking and keeps you hooked into the story right from the first shot in Phoenix to the very end. Hitchcock's use of cause and effect logic is the main reason this film's events connect and play out so well together. The fact that Sam mentions to Marion about needing money means that we know as an audience they have money troubles and only a few minutes later a rich man buying a house places 40k dollars right in front of Marion almost taunting her financial situation.To conclude you are certainly going to do yourself a disservice not watching this film.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "My second favourite film", "date": "2022-06-07T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8213830", "sentiment score": [0.0216, 0.053, 0.092, 0.3891, 0.4444]}, {"content": "I never fancied thrillers or detective stories because they are almost identical to the core: a premise, a murder, a search and a capture of a murderer - and once you know who did it there's no pleasure, no suspense in watching it again because you know the ending.

The funny thing is, when Gus Van Sant gave us the frame-by-frame remake in 1998, the senior Norman slaughtered the junior Norman. Therefore, Psycho even whips its own ass.I loved the film so much when I originally watched it, that I hunted down the Robert Bloch novels. They are as worthy of a read as the movies are worth watching. Stefano does an admirable job of bringing the story to the screen. Some brilliant little touches work well to build the tension and show Marion's anxiety. These are exampled best in her car journey sequences. And it shows how good scenes can be when you have a good writer, an imaginative director, and a talented actress - A perfect synergy of skills - which also sums up the picture.As I mentioned above, Hitchock is visionary and a very clever one, at that. Not only does he add creative scenes, such as the opening sequence as we pan across the city and zoom into one window where we find Marion and Sam in a cheap hotel room. It's a little choppy because of the mechanics of the shot and the equipment available. Today he would have made it look as smooth as the proverbial baby's botbot. And the same can be said for Arboghast's staircase fall. The clever bits come in the form of conventional scenes. Too much of a good thing is still too much. Hitchcock is a maestro; he knows when a segment needs extra pazazz and when to leave it alone. It creates a visual and emotional rollercoaster ride for the audience, which stays stimulating and captivating.The cast is superb, and everyone gives their all. There are no small parts in Psycho, and I have to admit to liking all the characters, which is usually inconceivable in most films. Everyone is so perfectly fleshed out and realistic. There is only one Norman Bates, and that is Anthony Hopkins. For most of the movie, he comes across flawlessly as the shy and nervous motel manager. But in the last sequence, he sends a cold shiver straight down your spine and into your soul with a smile as insanely deadly and dangerous as The Joker's.If you have not watched Psycho, I strongly suggest finding a copy and giving it a look-see.

I say that in the context of it being made in 1960. I can see that lots of reviewers don't rate it well but I'm guessing they are probably younger people with a completely different viewpoint of movies which is to be expected. I saw it decades ago but as it popped up on TV recently I decided to record and watch it again. It was astonishing to see in 1960 and although I saw it some years later on TV it was still memorable. Now after all these years I just want to point out what I still perceive as the good points. Of course it's dated in many ways but my reasons for watching would be as follows. The overall eerie atmosphere that Hitchcock conjured up is soon apparent as we realise that Janet Leigh is not the clean cut personality she first appears. Her sense of guilt manifests in her car ride, exacerbated by being followed by a cop. I found her mesmerising, easily her best performance, her sense of anxiousness conveyed brilliantly. At that time Janet Leigh had to be one of the most beautiful actresses in Hollywood, at least I think so. When she drives up to the Bates Motel is when the chills start.

The first one stars Janet Leigh, playing secretary Marion Crane. We see her, in a bra, in bed with her boyfriend in a risqu\u00e9 scene for the time that was hotly debated by censors still clinging to the Production Code. The two don't have the money to get married and Marion suddenly decides to steal $40,000 from her boss and flees Phoenix, Arizona, driving.Hitchcock makes us follow Marion's escape in detail, approaching the character with an invasive camera, close to her face, in medium and close-up. We became the girl's accomplices and began to suffer for her, in a way sympathizing with her actions. Her saga continues when she is woken up by a police officer after spending the night sleeping in her car by the side of the road. Then she decides to get rid of the car and a restless buy and sell negotiation ensues, again with the cop lurking. Marion feels the world close in around her and we feel it with her. The journey continues and Marion, in the rain, deviates from the road and stops at a motel - yes, the Bates Motel - to spend the night, because, in addition to being tired and not seeing anything with the storm, she has doubts about the act. Committed and begins to rethink the theft. She is then taken care of by an attentive young man, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), who owns the motel, and who lives with his mother in a nearby house, who puts her in the first room, near the lobby. Marion then goes to take a shower. She seems to want to clean up the mess she's made. There is a subtext of regret, of the cleansing brought by the water.And it's at this point that Hitchcock pulls our rug and presents the biggest plot twist of all time, with a lady - presumably Norman's jealous mother - mercilessly stabbing Marion to death in one of those sequences that, once seen, will never be forgotten, with Herrmann's soundtrack, loaded with strings and a lot, but a lot of tension (to the point that Herrmann's credits in the film immediately predate Hitchcock's!), despairing us. The audience at the time must have been bewildered by the surprise and completely confused by a simple fact that can be boiled down to a question: the protagonist died and now?Aided by Joseph Stefano's great script, Hitchcock brilliantly breaks the narrative axis, shocking the viewer. A confusion settles in our minds at this time. What would the story be like now? The conventional structure of the films is broken, changing the entire focus of the narrative. John L. Russell's brilliant photography helps create an essential trick to the plot's suspense. Notice how, in the famous scene, the play of light and shadows hides the main features of Mrs. Bates' face and the revelation of her face only happens in the last act. In this way, we have the tip, but not the solution for the case. George Tomasini's excellent editing is also essential in building the suspense. The rapid switching of images further enhances the impact of the bathtub scene. His talent can also be seen in the final scene, which perfectly synchronizes the various parallel actions that culminate in the monumental scene in which the identity of the assassin is revealed.Two other moments are essential for the viewer not to discover the plot solution ahead of time. The first is when Detective Arbogast sees Mrs Bates at the window of the house and is then approached by Norman Bates in front of the Hotel. The second happens when Sheriff Chambers (John McIntire) tells Sam and Lila (Vera Miles) that Mrs. Bates died ten years ago. In the next shot, we can see the door to Mrs. Bates and hear her and Norman talking. Next, we see Norman carrying his mother down to the basement. Despite never showing her face, Hicthcock practically nullifies in our minds the possibility that Norman and his mother are the same person. The director also creates visually interesting sequences, such as the dry cut from the drain plane to the dead Marion's eye plane. Through a tracking shot, he leaves the girl's eye, passes the money on the dresser and ends the scene with a distant shot of the house. This move is not done by accident. The director wants to show the whole crime scene, to set us up and remember everything that is involved in that murder.Psycho was the film responsible for one of the most famous and well-known murder scenes in movie history, when the character Marion Crane is surprised by the psychopath in the bathroom, while taking a shower. Technically, this sequence generated a huge amount of work (especially considering the time of production), taking a week to make, with 70 camera positions for just 45 seconds of film. The montage of several small scenes together, in charge of the technician Saul Bass (also creator of the initial signs of the film) had a disturbing effect, resulting in the illusion of violent blows from the murderer's knife, and where we can clearly see that it does not penetrate the body. By actress Janet Leigh.Another classic scene is also the murder of Detective Arbogast on the steps of the mansion where Norman Bates lived. Using a different technique, Hitchcock achieved an interesting effect by filming only the frightened and bloodied face of actor Martin Balsam, who was descending the stairs in a special chair, frantically waving his arms. In fact, the Gothic-looking house used by the production as a model for the construction of Bates' mansion actually exists, located in Kent, Ohio. The soundtrack, by Bernard Herrmann, is one of the best known and most consecrated in the history of horror and suspense cinema, especially in the part of the famous murder scene in the shower, with an impressive sequence of high-pitched and strident violins that they further intensified the atmosphere of tension and agony already existing between the murderer and his victim. The musician Herrmann was one of Hitchcock's great collaborators, forming a partnership with him responsible for nine films.Hitchcock delivers a great suspenseful plot from the start. Marion's drive between the bank and the motel is a claustrophobic driving lesson (in a good way). The character is consumed with guilt from the moment she steals the money, which doesn't stop her from continuing her journey. However, at every moment she is stunned in her mind with the consequences of her criminal act, wondering what her boss, her sister and even her own boyfriend would say if they found out what she did. Panic increases even more when she is intercepted by a suspicious police officer who interrogates her on the road and afterwards, in a great clash between desire and guilt.Janet Leigh's characterization should also take a closer look. If at the first moment we see her in intimate clothes, her clothing is white, as if portraying a certain purity of her character, after the robbery, she wears dark tones, which indicates her option for the \"bad path\", so to speak. Her redemption takes place at the motel, when she undresses fully, she rips up a compromising note and throws it in the toilet, as if to rid herself of her guilt. Naked, in the shower (fateful moment), with the shower squirting water on her face, it's the moment of total freedom. A freedom, however, that goes beyond death, explained by the horror of more than 70 frames in the montage of the stab wounds that end Marion's life.Norman Bates' construction is impeccable. Perkins presents us with a performance full of layers, which deepen and bring us closer to his character in addition to convincing everyone between the lines in his way of acting or even in his expression. At no time do we doubt the overwhelming power that the character has, and we are peeling away his submissive personality to his mother, of someone capable of hiding a crime to protect those he loves. And, as we go along, we are introduced to one of the best plots in history, as we understand the picture as a whole, giving us another unforgettable moment of cinema. It is no wonder that the figure of Perkins was so linked to Norman, shocking us with the mastery of his performance added to a powerful rhythm that marked everyone.Psycho would be the perfect murder thriller were it not for its ending. And I'm not talking here about solving the Marion murder plot. It does so flawlessly, with a round script, brilliant performances, precise direction and haunting soundtrack. I'm actually talking about the final three minutes in which Hitchcock doesn't shy away from presenting viewers with a detailed, but extremely artificial and ultimately unnecessary explanation of Norman Bates' insanity. He is trapped in a cell, but a forensic psychiatrist enters the sheriff's office and, speaking to Lila and Sam, explains everything the viewer already knows. Nothing is left for doubt or for discussion. Norman Bates is unveiled, laid bare in a version for dummies of all the sensational work that came immediately before.Perhaps it was an extreme insecurity due to the fact that the director had invested his money in the production that had been left aside by Paramount and that even had its distribution sabotaged. But the fact is that the ending is there, unfortunately, an example of \"amateurism\" in a work that would otherwise be worthy of a standing ovation. I recognize that maybe this statement is an exaggeration, but notice how the whole sequence is completely at odds with what came before. There is relatively little dialogue in the film and all the explanation we need has already been precisely provided by Hitchcock in the sequences that take place inside Bates' \"haunted mansion\". Repetition tires and calls viewer's idiots almost literally.Psycho is a timeless classic that, for better or worse, inspired (along with Rosemary's Baby) a series of films focused on horror and suspense and consolidated several clich\u00e9s of the genre.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Psycho is literally a watershed, because, in fact, the viewer is treated to not one, but two very different films.

He made incredible thrillers such as Vertigo, North by Northwest, and The Birds, but can any of these pictures match the cultural and film impact this particular film had? Even though the major surprises have long been spoiled, this still remains a masterpiece in tension and manipulation. Some consider this to be the start of the slasher genre which of course allowed films such as 1978's Halloween to be produced. Hitchcock made some very bold directorial choices that stands the test of time...including murdering the protagonist about a third through the thriller. That shower scene remains one of the most effective murder scenes ever created. There are no knife cuts or wounds displayed. There is a little amount of blood as Hitchcock felt like the audience would not be ready for such gore, but Gus Van Sant later repudiated that fact in his shot-to-shot 1998 remake. Rather, Hitchcock used sharp editing techniques and various camera angles to full effect. Bernard Herrmann's score of screeching violins and cellos is the final straw that made this scene legendary. To this day, it remains one of the best scenes in cinema, in my personal opinion. It received mixed reviews upon release (mainly because critics were forced to see the film with an audience) but a reevaluation was much kinder. Without a doubt, this is Hitchcock's best film (out of many incredible films). There is no denying its impact on cinema as a psychoanalytical thriller. I was surprised to see how much analysis is out there.Paramount did not want the film to be made at all. They felt like the audience would not care for such a movie. Hitchcock shot the film for only $800,000, a low budget amount for this time frame. Instead of using a large crew, he used his Alfred Hitchcock Presents television crew to save money. He chose to shoot the film in black-and-white...which also helped the movie itself. It allowed the film to show less gore. The Bates Motel and house were built on the Universal backlot. Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins were bankable stars, but they had to take a major pay cut like Hitchcock did. Bernard Herrmann actually received a doubled salary because of his influential music. The director originally intended not to have music during the murder scene. We should all be thankful for Herrmann's insistence. Hitchcock got away with his picture being more sexual. In 1960, the Production Code was failing. Right away, in the opening scene, where Leigh and John Gavin are making love, that is proof that no one cared about the code. That also applies to the murder scene. There were only very few edits that the director had to made. So yes, the film is more sexual in nature when compared with Hitchcock's earlier films.Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a Phoenix-based assistant who laments over the fact that she cannot marry her boyfriend, Sam Loomis (John Gavin) over his alimony payments. She finds an opportunity to steal $40,000 in cash from her boss's client and escape to California where she can marry Sam. She makes it very close to the border and decides to sleep for the night at Bates Motel run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Bates has had little business since they moved the state highway. He lives with his mother on the big house on the hill overlooking the hotel. Marion learns that his mother is a mad, controlling woman but Norman chalks it up to mental illness. She later decides to return the money to Phoenix...but never makes it. Sam, along with Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) and an investigator, Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam) arrive at the hotel to make their own inquiries over Marion's disappearance. It is important to note that Norman's mother is very protective of her son.The performances are great throughout. Janet Leigh has never been better as she had a commanding screen presence. Anthony Perkins is great at garnering sympathy from the audience. Even though he commits the murders, there is much more to the truth. One could say that Norman becomes the protagonist after Marion Crane is out of the picture. That is analysis for another time. The supporting cast is wonderful. Martin Balsam is a great investigator!Even if you go into the film knowing every surprise, Psycho is a tense, melodramatic thriller with Alfred Hitchcock at his very best. I can only imagine the pure shock of the audience in 1960 seeing such vivid imagery for the first time. Hitchcock actually instituted a rule where no latecomers were allowed. Gee, wish that rule was in place for all movies. He made some very bold choices and he made every dollar in his limited budget count. The shower scene is one of the best scenes ever (Hitchcock purportedly used 60-75 different cameras to get the many shots needed so he could rapidly edit them together. Paramount had no intention of getting the film made yet through Hitchcock's perseverance, this is his best film (and that is saying something).My Grade: A+", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Hitchcock's Most Impactful Film!", "date": "2022-02-23T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7893018", "sentiment score": [0.0117, 0.0227, 0.0504, 0.3437, 0.5714]}, {"content": "What an amazing movie , I have seen it several times over the years , and each time it never fails to scare me, and fill me with dread .Everything about it is perfect , from the characters , to the setting ,\nI mean , has there ever been another location as creepy as THAT house since !This is a true classic , brilliant , from the master himself .", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Hitchcock Excels", "date": "2022-02-22T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7889080", "sentiment score": [0.0008, 0.0007, 0.0017, 0.0243, 0.9724]}, {"content": "Psycho starts off as a film noir and morphs into something unique.

Even when you rewatch it (aware of its many plot-twists), it immerses you in the suspense all over again. It's minimalist approach is strikingly effective at conveying isolation and vulnerability. The lack of company except a deranged young man is nail-biting discomfort. I'm aware this film is highly rated in nearly all regards (IMDb, rotten tomatoes, AFI, The Academy), but it's entertainment value makes it worthy of such praise.Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh are unforgettable in their roles. Their characters are incredibly similar: both have something to hide and are on poor terms with the opposite gender. It's worth observing Marion Crane's interactions with other male characters before she meets Bates. In the opening scene, she is slowly leaving after an intimate moment with her boyfriend Sam (a confident, devoted, and attached lover of muscular physique). But Marion's mannerisms indicate she doesn't offer mutual loyalty. From then on it seems as if all other men are obstructions in her plans: from the police officer to the car dealer. Her acting talent shines in her hasty interactions with the officer and the car dealer. She finally meets Norman, a nervous, polite and uncanny skinny man, (a foil for Sam), whom she doesn't quite fall for either. While Norman is psychologically unable to bond with women, Marion simply seems indifferent to the men in her life, viewing them as obstacles. I'm convinced more commentary on such gender dynamics than meets the eye pervades the entire film.Personally, the best part of the movie are the dialogue scenes. I wish today were like the sixties when a movie plot was more streamlined and contained the bare minimum of believability. The dialogue in Psycho mostly moves the plot forward at a perfect pace. It is the root of the suspense that Hitchcock is famous for. The discussions about Marion's disappearance, Norman's interrogation, and mystery surrounding his mother all pull you deeper into the story, and fill you with suspense to fill the gaps between thrills.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 3}, "heading": "Near perfect; classic thrills", "date": "2021-11-28T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7593672", "sentiment score": [0.0053, 0.062, 0.3038, 0.5714, 0.0575]}, {"content": "Hitchcock is an undisputed genius.\"Psycho\" was released in 1960.

She had a home, why wouldn't they have been there when he was in town? Why have the long distance relationship? Why doesnt she move to California? Why does him paying alimony prevent them from getting married? Why would she steal $40,000 -which is $350,000 now- and abandon her home instead of just moving to CA and finding another job? She would have been tracked down after absconding with that much money. She would have to go on the run instead of being able to settle down. Unless she planned on talking him into leaving the country with her.He had no idea she was on her way there after taking off with a pile of cash. I guess she was just going to show up on his doorstep with all that money and say she decided to start a new life? Had he gone along with it, he would be culpable as well. She was at her place of employment for 10 years and had built a good work history; he had his own business in the store. Maybe she felt like she could throw away what she had, but would he have been willing to do the same? Seems like she not only risked prison but also took a huge chance in whether he'd go along with things in the first place.If these things are to be treated seriously, it seems Norman isnt the only one with psychological or personality issues. Although she did end up deciding to go back with the money. Good thing, since the cop had pulled her over and then she was seen changing cars. She would have been caught in no time. It just didn't seem like there would have been any reason for her to do all of that in the first place. Marion Crane felt like a cold, one-dimensional character that lacked humanity or personality. At least for a time.Shower scene: There would have been a lot more blood. With as many times she was stabbed, it would have been everywhere. We see a tiny bit go down the drain and a trickle down the side of the tub. Not that I think a gory exposition was needed, it's just the mismatch was obvious.But in contrast, the stark imagery was effective and Leigh's performance, as well as how it was shot, was iconic. Her face as she screamed, her outstretched hand. The way she pulled the curtain down, fell over the side and the slow, slow pullback from her eye as though from the point of view of life leaving her body. It was epic. And it was the first time Marion Crane was truly displayed as a human being.Dual persona: Anthony Perkins was incredible as Norman and Norma Bates. The odd, quirky nuances. The feeling that something is off. The creeping strangeness just below the skin. I loved that he was carefree, easygoing, talkative and friendly. This was in contrast to other characters who were serious, businesslike, uptight. He was a welcome pressure valve release. It feels like he has the most personality and is the most realistic and well-rounded of all the characters. But when Norman was nervous, he became very flustered and upset indeed. And of course the music is awesome and takes on a life of its own and I loved it from the first notorious notes.I'm not rating this because it came out 9 years before I was born and it was a much different time then. I feel like my vote coming 60+ years after its debut wouldn't be relative because I don't have that fresh, brand new perspective. I'd known the spoilers long before ever seeing it. I can only talk about what I saw and experienced from my own perspective. I did try to imagine what it would have been like to be there on opening night, never before having seen something like this.

My mother showed it to me when I was growing up and despite my not liking black and white films then, I enjoyed this one quite a bit. I thought the twist was absolutely amazing and the cultural significance of this film is immense. I've seen his movie many times throughout the years, with the last few times in the theater. I even took Jaime, as she had never seen this version as well. The official synopsis is a Phoenix secretary embezzles $40,000 from her employer's client, goes on the run and checks into a remote motel run by a young man under the domination of his mother.We kick off this one with a couple in a motel room. The woman is Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and her lover is Sam Loomis (John Gavin). They meet up here because they aren't married. Sam loves her, but he is divorced and has a lot of debts. Marion loves him and wants to marry. She is getting frustrated with their relationship. She just wants to be with him. This is an interesting dynamic for the time period.That is when something pops up that could help their situation. Her boss brings in a client that is trying to buy a house for his daughter and comes in with $40,000 in cash. Marion is asked to take it to the bank. She inquires if she can go home afterwards due to a headache. What she really does is heads home, packs and tries to flee. Her boss sees her in the car though or at least he thinks he does.What I really like about the next sequence is that Marion is hearing the voices of everyone back in Phoenix. She is thinking about what is probably happening, even though she has until Monday to get away, as these events happened on a Friday. I like this, because this is exactly what I do about a lot of situations in my life. I will play them in my head for all possible scenarios, your normal overthinker. It does seem these are the exact conversations that are being had as well.Marion has a run-in with a highway patrol officer and this causes her to trade in her car and buy a used one. She then plays out what happens there in head as well. She doesn't make things easier as she comes off very suspicious. She is vague in her answers and she does things that are highly unusual.It starts to rain so she pulls off to a motel. It turns out to be the Bates Motel and she meets with the proprietor, Norman (Anthony Perkins). They get along pretty well and it is clear that he is attracted to her. There is an issue that arises with his mother and him not giving her dinner. This all leads to the infamous shower scene.Something that I didn't notice in my previous viewings of this film is that Marion changes her mind about what she is trying to do after she speaks with Norman. This makes what happens to her effect me even more, because she is going to try to do the right thing despite what she did. I also want to comment on the impact of what happens to her as well. Most of us already know the twist here, heck I believe there are a lot of people who know this scene without even seeing this film. This is iconic, because it changes cinema and influences great films like Scream.When Marion goes missing, her sister Lila (Vera Miles) seeks out Sam and so does Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam), a private detective who is searching out the stolen money. This all leads everyone back to the Bates Motel and to learn the truth about Norman and his mother.The issues with Norman are also interesting. It isn't the textbook definition of split personalities, as they can talk to each other. The final images we see in the fruit cellar end up influencing films going forward like Dressed to Kill.Acting in this film is also quite amazing. Perkins is perfect as Norman. The novel has him overweight and kind of greasy looking. This film makes it unnerving that he has the boy next door looks and he seems quite harmless. Knowing what he is capable of though makes it that much scarier. Miles and Gavin are solid as the two who are trying to figure out what happened to Marion. Leigh is amazing and what happens to her is iconic for cinema to come. The rest of the cast round out the film very well for what was needed also.Runtime on the film is 109 minutes, but it doesn't feel like it. We move through the plot points at a good clip. I even thought it was interesting that I knew the outcome of the mystery, but this time around I was focusing more on things that I didn't notice in previous viewings of the film. The only thing that I didn't like is the psychologist who is explaining Norman and his psyche. I don't mind it to an extent, but I think it goes too far. It is interesting getting in giallo films, as they took this concept along with villains across genres. The final image of Norman is great as is the actual reveal as well.As for the effects, there aren't a lot of them. A lot of this goes to the time period and what they could show. The shower scene is amazing though. We never actually see the knife penetrating due to the great editing, but we feel like we see it. The blood is good in that the water is washing some of it away and the splatters look realistic. The final image of the film has a cool effect that I had never noticed until these later viewings. The film is also shot amazing. I come to expect that from an Alfred Hitchcock film though.Something that really helps make this film feel eerie is the Bernard Herrmann's score. I actually listen to this one when I'm writing, because the music sets the perfect mood. There are some scenes that aren't even scary as to what we are seeing, but the music gives it such an unnerving feeling that it gets my anxiety going. The music cues during the shower scene are also iconic.Now with that said, this film is a classic. It is important film for many genres. It helped to spark the slasher films that could come a couple decades later. There is the issue of man being the monster and mental illness. It is shocking what it does with a popular actress like Leigh and quite iconic as well. The rest of the acting is great as is the story overall. There's not a lot in the way of effects, but what is used are great as is how the film is directed. The score also definitely helps this film and is also quite amazing. If you've never seen this classic, I recommend giving it a viewing. Even if you know what the reveal is, it is fun to try to pick out things to reinforce it. This film is very near perfect.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 2}, "heading": "An Important Film to Cinema History", "date": "2021-10-29T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7491928", "sentiment score": [0.0036, 0.0229, 0.1794, 0.6357, 0.1584]}, {"content": "By now, everyone should be familiar with Hitchcock's amazing skills as a director. I've already discussed many films he was responsible for, mainly the early ones that don't get a lot of attention. Now it's time to do the opposite and talk about possibly his most acclaimed movie. Psycho has acquired such a legendary reputation through the years that it is usually considered one of the best horror movies ever. Although the horror element doesn't come into play until you're almost halfway through, this film definitely delivers a large amount of truly frightening and traumatizing scenes, one of which in particular is so well known that most people will recognize it even if they never watched this movie. As always I'll begin by explaining the storyline, which involves a girl named Marion (Janet Leigh) who decides to go into work one day and swipe a huge amount of money from her boss. She does this because her love interest Sam (John Gavin) has a large amount of debt that he needs paid off. After Marion steals 40k dollars, she falls asleep in her car on the side of a road that night and wakes up to a cop tapping on her window. Although she didn't break any laws, the cop is strangely suspicious of her panicky behavior. This later gets confirmed when Marion visits a car dealership to trade her car for a fresh one, even though there's nothing wrong with hers. After driving for some time, it starts to darken outside, so Marion pulls over to sleep at a motel owned by a man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). At first, Norman seems like an outgoing and friendly enough person to Marion, but as they continue their conversation, he gets hostile when she suggests Norman's invalid mother should be institutionalized. After they talk, Marion retires to the room Norman gave her, and he proceeds to spy on her via a peephole in his room that was hidden behind a painting. As Norman watches Marion undress and step into the shower, he makes his move. He sneaks into Marion's bathroom, pulls back the shower curtain, and stabs her to death. He then puts her corpse in the trunk of her car and drives it to a swamp, where it sinks into the bog. As expected, Marion's sudden disappearance does not go unnoticed. Her sister Lila (Vera Miles) questions Sam about the fate of her sister, but he knows nothing. An investigator named Arbogast (Martin Balsam) shows up and says he has an interest in Marion's disappearance, but only because he's trying to find the money she stole. Arbogast heads to the Bates Motel in order to find out what its proprietor knows about Marion, but Norman is actually really cool under pressure when put on the spot like this. He appears very calm while being interrogated so Arbogast can't tell if he's lying or not, but his explanations do have a few discrepancies that Arbogast exploits. Norman says Marion left early the next morning, but there's no way he could have known that considering he told Arbogast he didn't recognize her face. Eventually Arbogast falls into the same trap that Marion did when he asks questions regarding Norman's mother. He at least wants proof of her existence, but Norman turns him down. After trying to get to the bottom of this, Arbogast is stabbed to death by Norman in the old mansion behind the motel. Arbogast's demise has an immediate effect on Sam and Marion's sister, who now realize they have to travel to the motel themselves. The investigator hasn't been heard from in a while, so they are certain something happened to him. Upon arriving, Sam awkwardly strikes up a conversation with Norman to buy time for Lila to search his house. By the time Norman realizes the girl Sam came here with is nowhere to be found, Lila has already journeyed into the mansion's basement and makes a horrible discovery: the rotting corpse of Mrs. Bates is sitting in a chair waiting for her. Norman finally shows up and, determined to protect his secret, tries to stab Lila, but is disarmed by Sam. Norman is arrested and placed in confinement, and Marion's car is pulled out of the swamp by chains. Psycho is, in my and many other people's opinions, Hitchcock's masterpiece. He never really made a downright bad movie, but this one has got to be the best. No matter how many times I watch it, I just want to see it again. I even wish I could get rid of my memories of it so I can experience it for the first time once more. It is one of few movies that has a stellar cast all around, and basically none of the performances are lacking. Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam, and especially Anthony Perkins were all awe-inspiring. The movie also presents a unique idea for Perkins' role, because instead of him being a heartless killer, he apparently does everything he can to please his mother. It even explains in the movie how Norman pretended to be his mother when he murdered Marion, because her soul apparently took over him completely. He talks in his mother's voice and acts surprised when he sees Marion's dead body, suggesting that Mrs. Bates was in control of his actions, not him. Just a strange new take on split personalities. Originally destined to be an episode of Alfred Hitchcock Presents, Psycho proved that a longer runtime can very well mean a larger audience. A less noticeable trait though is how it basically paved the way for more violent movies such as Friday the 13th, even though the killing in this is pretty tame compared with something like that. One important fact about this movie that not many people realize is how Joseph Stefano wrote the screenplay for it.

I saw it for the first time today and I understand all the praise it receives, it's the definition of a perfect horror film.Psycho tells a simple story of a woman who is going rogue with 40,000 dollars in her pocket. When she's in her car, rain starts pouring so she inevitably decides to stop at a tiny and secluded motel. Little does she know that the owner is a crazed psychopath.Filming Psycho in black and white only helps the movie become the cult classic it has turned out to be today, imagine watching the shower scene without the B&W filter, it definitely wouldn't have the same effect. And it doesn't just help certain iconic scenes, it makes the whole movie feel ominous and very sinister. The characters are just remarkable and the most memorable of them all is Norman Bates. It's exciting to delve into this character's hidden psychotic personality. Throughout the movie's runtime he is almost winking at us, giving us hints that we shouldn't be fooled by his formal appearance, he is controlling his sociopathic behaviour inside of him. He does not want to unveil his second personality to the audience until the very end. He is a frightening character because he looks completely normal but there is this impending doom and terror that follows him around wherever he goes. You have the feeling he's a disturbed individual but you don't get enough proof to fully be sure of it.The setting is very chilling and can often be hair-raising. There are multiple frames of the dreary, gloomy, dull and greyish mansion that Norman Bates considers his world. The cinematography is hauntingly beautiful. The camera setups manipulate the audience and ultimately hides them from the truth. Another element of the film that we barely ever see in modern films is when the main character dies in the first act. She was the central figure of the story but her sudden death moves her out of the spotlight and she inevitably becomes a false protagonist.I highly recommend Psycho, it could almost be perceived as a character study.

A woman flees a bad decision, and lands in the lair of a predator who is falling deep into his own psychosis. By the time he made PSYCHO, Hitchcock had directed dozens of films. He was acknowledged as the Master of Suspense, with the capital letters in that honorary title always implied in conversation. Hitchcock knew exactly how to construct a scene to evoke and exploit specific feelings. His style on PSYCHO was brisk and economical, and could be exceptionally brutal.Nowhere is that more apparent than in the murder of Marian Crane, played by the film's lone marquee movie star, Janet Leigh. No one going into PSYCHO expected Leigh's character to be killed off halfway through the movie, much less for it to happen in a dramatic and shattering sequence. The screeching strings and deep notes of the score by composer Bernard Herman turned the shower scene into a grueling horror showcase and sealed the movie's first major murder as a cinematic all-timer. The scene is created with such great skill that it has power even today, even after being endlessly homaged, parodied, replicated and ripped off. The shower scene lasts all of three minutes, but that 180 seconds echoes through decades of cinema.All Stripped Down\nPSYCHO is entrenched as part of movie culture now, but its future was far from certain in 1960. Maybe you think of PSYCHO as an \"old movie\" (it is!), which makes its black and white aesthetic seem entirely appropriate. At the time, however, color was the norm for movies, especially for big pictures like those made by Alfred Hitchcock. His last movie before PSYCHO was NORTH BY NORTHWEST, a splashy caper starring Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint. A hard-edged black and white thriller was an abrupt deviation from expectations.Paramount didn't want to make PSYCHO, so Hitchcock paid for it himself and produced it on the cheap. That meant using his \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\" production crew. Another money saving measure was the use of black and white film. All in all, PSYCHO cost under a million bucks; it was a fast, no-frills affair.A useful side benefit of shooting in black and white was that it helped hide some of the movie's gore. In 1960, Hollywood studios were still loosely bound by the fast-withering constraints of the production code. For decades, the production code had specified content seen as inappropriate for Hollywood movies. Explicit sex and violence were forbidden, and even implied content was strictly controlled. But the production code was on the way to obsolescence, and PSYCHO - which became a hit in part because of its shocking content - helped usher it out the door. No one had ever seen a movie like PSYCHO from Alford Hitchcock, or from any other major filmmaker working with an American studio.No Spoilers... or Else!Movie audiences now are averse to spoilers in a way that is fairly different from the norm in 1960, when it wasn't uncommon for ticket-buyers to walk into a movie at any point during the running time, then sit through a program of a feature or two and multiple shorts. Hitchcock's well-documented flair for publicity, combined with exceptional word-of-mouth, helped turn PSYCHO into a bona fide hit.As specified by the director, PSYCHO was promoted with a forbidding warning: No one would be admitted to the theatre after the movie began. Rather than turning audiences off from the movie, that stipulation created interest, and lines, and an ever-expanding audience.A Horrific Legacy\nPSYCHO led to sequels (two of which are surprisingly good), an eyebrow-raising shot-for-shot remake by Gus Van Sant (which is an oddly compelling experiment) and a five-season television prequel series, \"Bates Motel.\" Those are just the direct descendents of the movie; the entire slasher genre owes a debt to Hitchcock, just as horror movies in general enjoy a popularity that might not be quite the same without this benchmark-setting shocker.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Psycho(1960)", "date": "2021-08-09T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7212708", "sentiment score": [0.0676, 0.185, 0.1934, 0.3835, 0.1705]}, {"content": "This film can be said to be the first work of dual personality, which has a far-reaching impact on some later works.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Dual personality", "date": "2021-08-09T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7211944", "sentiment score": [0.0275, 0.0821, 0.3643, 0.3912, 0.1349]}, {"content": "Anthony Perkins does an outstanding job portraying his character.

Depends on your point of view. The legendary shower scene was brilliant. The \"illusion\" of nudity is all there was. Janet Leigh was very sexy in the two \"bra and slip\" scenes. However, Vera Miles, in my opinion, was even more sexy-and she never even removes her coat! I guess it's the way a woman comes across. As to Anthony Perkins' performance-he was made for the role. I've never thought the \"twist\" ending was so hard to see coming. Only the genius of Hitchcock could have made everything tie together so well.

Thoughts of paranoia, panic, and guilt haunt Marion as she travels the isolated interstate roads in a near constant state of tension and unease. When she's forced by bad weather to stop for the night at the isolated Bates Motel, she meets the manager, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a soft spoken, timid, but seemingly well meaning man who sets her up for the night unaware of the terror that awaits her at the hands of Norman's mother.Released in 1960 to polarizing reviews but massive audience approval and huge box office, Psycho has become a pop culture touchstone with music, characters, story beats, and iconography routinely referenced, homage, and parodied. Based on the 1959 novel of the same name by Robert Bloch the books premise of creating sympathetic characters only to kill them off in situations that resembled Ed Gein spoke to Hitchcock who fought tooth and nail to get the film made against the wishes of executives who found the premise too lurid and tasteless. Using his TV crew from the TV show Alfred Hitchcock Presents and banking more on his prestige than resources to draw names the film was nothing short of a miracle to get off the ground with resistance from both executives and censors who were irked by the film's brazen disregard for production code guidelines. The movie against the expectations of all Hitchcock's naysayers created a haunting psychological thriller with a sense of style and dread that uses limited resources to great effect.With Psycho there's so many elements that come together it's hard to pick out just one, from Bernard Herrmann's iconic string heavy musical score that keeps the audience on the edge of their seats in states of tension that are the only respite from creeping terror, to the cinematography by John L. Russell that perfectly frames the shots from the most iconic to the seemingly inconsequential this is maximum effect with minimum resources. The flourishes are well done, but they'd be ultimately meaningless without a solid story to back them up. Hitchcock creates intriguing characters and atmosphere from the get go with desperate stakes motivating instigating actions and brining relatability to the characters so we care about what's going on. Anthony Perkins is the central point of Psycho in Norman Bates and his performance is pitch perfect with his mannerisms, delivery, and body language conveying a story in and of itself. From Norman's meek politeness, to his discomfort with his own sexuality, and hair trigger temper Perkins hits all the right notes to make Norman both tragic and threatening.Psycho is an important film not just for pushing the boundaries of sex and violence but also in unconventional storytelling and audience misdirection. With a storyline that isn't afraid to yank the rug out from the audiences feet to scenes that are designed to make the audience uncomfortable, psycho understands how to get under its audience's skin and take them to the darkest recesses of humanity.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "An important film not just as a watershed moment, but for its brutal and psychological approach to the thriller genre that endures to this day", "date": "2021-07-04T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7088712", "sentiment score": [0.0161, 0.1314, 0.4515, 0.3684, 0.0326]}, {"content": "Hitchcock always manages to create suspense in the most unlikely places, and this title didn't manage to disappoint.Although it was supposed to be between my friends and I, they didn't show up, personally making it one star lower than it should be.

In that later genre this seals her fate. And her sister Lila (Vera Miles) is the original \"Last Girl\". The story is superb.

In Hollywood, the decade began with a strict censorship code, stagey violence, films shot in studio sets and only the vaguest allusions to sex, and narcotics. By the end of the decade, censorship had ended, location shooting had become standard practice, and sex, drugs and a greater sense of realism had permeated the art-form. Thus, the '60s is where the aesthetics of the cinema that we are familiar with today meaningfully took shape.Bearing the above in mind, it might seem strange to regard Psycho as an iconic film of the '60s: it was, after all, made under strict conditions of censorship, filmed mainly in studios, and features classic Hollywood artificiality, including supposed driving which involved characters moving fake steering wheels against the backdrop of a large projector. And yet, for all of its surface appearance, Psycho was a film that truly helped to break the taboos which existed in cinema at the time.Think of the infamous shower scene, iconic in and of itself, ingenious editing made us believe that we had seen a naked woman stabbed to death in front of our eyes. And yet, somehow, nothing had actually been shown that broke the code. Think of the moral ambiguity of the closest thing the film has to a heroine: she is on the move after stealing money from her workplace in order to set up a life for herself and the man with whom she's having an affair. Think of the themes the film explores: transvestism, incestuous desire, necrophilia, it doesn't get much more subversive than that.This film, for all of its surface appearance, truly broke boundaries in terms of being rawer and more unfiltered than mainstream Hollywood cinema had hitherto been able to be.

Sam does not know of Marion's theft, because it was a robbery by sudden opportunity.Marion ends up at the Bates Motel, run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Norman's invalid mother presumably lives in an old house behind the motel. After several awkward interactions with Norman, Marion prepares for bed and takes a shower, during which she is stabbed to death by a character who does not seem to be Norman. Norman comes, is aghast, cleans up everything, puts the body and all of Marion's belongings into Marion's car, and sinks the whole thing in a nearby swamp.

After some work, Arbogast learns that Marion did stay at the hotel. He is determined to talk to Norman's mother but is murdered by her when he finds her.To try and find evidence, Sam and Lila then pose as a married couple and check into the hotel.

However, \"Mother\" has become the more dominant of Norman's two personalities.The drama is maintained at a high pace, as one expects from Hitchcock. He made \"Psycho\" in a budget of less than a million dollars, and also insisted it be in black and white since it would be \"too bloody\" in color.

It was something I discovered when I was young and it chilled me to my core. Despite its lack of gore, that scene still sends chills down my spine and it's due to Alfred Hitchcock's incredible execution. The iconic score by Bernard Herrmann, the build up of tension and Janet Leigh's scream all combined make up one of the best scenes in cinema to ever exist.

Janet Leigh got many accolades for her work but it's impossible to deny just how magnificent Perkins is as Norman Bates. The final shot of him transitioning from an innocent looking person to an absolute psychopath is enough to prove his acting capabilities.

The acting and dialogue between characters is so good, especially the opening marriage conversation that shows how conflicted the main character is.

So director Al Hitchcock would have us believe after watching his original psycho-drama of 1960.Born in London (Leytonstone), Al began in Silents, first directing rom-drams, then suspense (The-Lady-Vanishes The-39-Steps). Like many proven English makers, he'd cross the Pond, then the North American continent to the USA's movie mecca, Hollywood, expanding his repertoire on makes like Mr-&-Mrs-Smith Rear-Window Rebecca Saboteur and Strangers-On-A-Train, eventually focusing his energies on one genre. And of his vast catalog, two films stand out, cementing his place atop the hierarchy of horror directors: Psycho (60) and The-Birds (63), both ingenious tales set in eerily everyday circumstance, the latter airing on 70s TV with frequency (What's a little eye-gauging and tortious bird behavior, anyway, right?), and Psycho, with its famous chef salad shower scene and weird mother-son dynamic, proving too graphic for censors who sometimes DID know best. But with cable's arrival (80s) and codes liberated, all of us finally got to check-in the Bates Motel, assuming all risks and liabilities appurtenant (gulp).Some earlier films crossed the line: Born-to-Kill (47) & Powell's neglected masterwork, Peeping-Tom (60), also featuring a lead whose creative, kindly nature masks a parent-fostered, demonic psychosis, released in the UK two months prior (Ap 60), yet, its US distribution delayed (11-61) when usual partner in horror proliferation, A-I-P, oddly took a pass, allowing Paramount's picture to make the first, indelible mark on minds of American movie-goers. Even so, Psycho did distinguish itself. Innovations in technical arts created shocking sights & sounds that would change movies forever. How censors ever let it show in theaters is a small miracle, or deal made with the devil.Anthony Perkins stars as the charming but demented desk clerk Norman Bates in the role that made him as legendary as Hitchcock, with Janet Leigh as the comely check-in who jumps from criminal frying-pan ($$ >> APB) into the victim's fire, learning the hardest way possible that 'Crime never pays!' Other contributors: writers Joe Stefano (s/p) & Bob Bloch (b), cinematographer John Russell (his frame and pull-back from the eye of a corpse is exquisite), music man Bernard Hermann & sound specialist William Russell (the piercing note that powers the shower scene may be the most famous single tone in all of cinema), costumer Rita Riggs, set designer George Milo, special-effects by Clarence Champagne and highly under-rated editor, George Tomasini (Rear-Window Stalag-17 Vertigo The-Misfits The-Birds The-Time-Machine).Missed the mark: 1) At first meet, Norman is too normal for what lay ahead, his \"mother\" and \"madness\" mentions a little too cute; 2) John Gavin's Sam is almost as weird as Norman, his attempts to fluster Bates enough to get the boyfriend tossed on his ear anywhere else, but then Loomis has his uses, and 3) I could've done without the last five minutes of psycho-splaining from the good doctor (Oakland) in preparation for Bates' legal defense (incompetence in Arizona), and yet, still a masterpiece (4/4).", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Psycho", "date": "2021-04-14T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6812767", "sentiment score": [0.0669, 0.142, 0.1847, 0.4017, 0.2046]}, {"content": "Psycho is one of Hitchcock's famous films.

While the entire focus of their discussion was gender identification and violence against women, only two of many important aspects of this work of art, they totally ignored the most essential elements of the film which have compelled me to watch it over and over again for the past 60 years. The film is exceptional because of (1) the overall direction of Alfred Hitchcock and his mastery of the suspense genre, as well as his remarkable ability to tell a story with stunning visual beauty, (2) the magnificent musical score of Bernard Hermann which, by itself, creates a level of tension unlike any other film score in my memory, (3) the superb acting of Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh in the critical lead roles as well as a few supporting cast members who very much impressed me, including Frank Albertson as the man whose stolen $40,000 sets the wheels rolling for all of the following action, and (4) for me, the startling design of the opening credits by Saul Bass, which, accompanied by Mr. Hermann's spine-chilling music, establishes a high level of uncertainty, if not terror, even before the movie actually begins.Even though I was prohibited from seeing \"Psycho\" at age eleven when it first opened in 1960, I was soon on my way aboard the Number 8 bus to downtown Elizabeth NJ, where I spent many Saturday afternoons watching movies in any one of the city's four theatres. On this occasion, I travelled alone so that there would be no blabbermouth witnesses.Subsequent viewings will never reach the level of terror as that initial session in 1960 when I was scared out of my wits. I will also state that the level of tension and fear established so well by the director in the first half is not sustained by a much less eventful, far less gripping second half.After many viewings, I never tire of the superb performances of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins. Although Leigh only appears during the first thirty minutes, she plays a seriously conflicted and even tormented Marion Crane to perfection, especially when Marion is painfully obliged to wear a calm and impassive face to the public. Apparently, Perkins' acting career fell victim to his own success here as his depiction of Norman Bates was so legendary that he could no longer be easily identified by audiences as anyone else.The one major flaw for me is Simon Oakland's awkward and totally unnecessary monologue at the end, which served to spoil an otherwise excellent movie. While I didn't understand a word of it at the age of eleven, it still annoys me more than sixty years later. Norman seated in the padded cell with mother's very creepy voiceover and the superimposition of Mama's hideous image over his face at the last instant doesn't require Oakland's tedious and very confusing explanation at all. A picture says a thousand words if it is presented properly. What makes the ending even worse is the psychiatrist's odd gleefulness as he confirms Marion's tragic fate to Sam and Lila. Although I never allowed this awkward ending to ruin the rest of an extraordinary film, it proves that even Alfred Hitchcock isn't perfect as the pedantic and pompous psychiatrist should have been left on the cutting floor where he belonged.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "An Unmatched Work by the Master of Suspense", "date": "2021-04-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6792442", "sentiment score": [0.0693, 0.2269, 0.1507, 0.3424, 0.2106]}, {"content": "The stage curtains open ...Alfred Hitchcock has had so many good movies, that I'd be hard pressed to identify one as his masterpiece.

Just the look alone gives that sense of boldness. The striking black and white cinematography is a stark contrast to the vibrant colors that had become a trademark of his over the past decade or so. But being the master that he was, he knew that this was the proper way to shoot the film.\nThe first twenty minutes or so of it, are really nothing like what comes later on. Involving Marion's escape with the stolen money and the suspicion her strange behavior arises in those she meets. Either way it makes these scenes play, because there's still a tension to them.\nAfter trading in her car, she pulls off the road, due to the rain, and into a motel-The Bates Motel. She happens to be the only customer at this remote place run by an odd, young man, Norman(Perkins), who lives with his invalid mother. Anthony Perkins so convincingly portrays the various and changing emotions of his character that you might almost be inclined to think he faces the same mental struggles Mr Bates does. What makes this character and performance considered to be one of the best is the complexity and contrast. Norman Bates has a friendly innocence to him that also touches into quirkiness. But in an instant he can fly into a seething contempt...and possibly even worse. Because in a few hours Marion is murdered by his mother(in a scene that might be the most famous of any film period) and Norman must dispose of the evidence. While Norman may be doing something wrong, Hitchcock still manages to tense up his audience with the car not sinking into the water. Even if you don't want to pull for him you can't help but urge for it to sink-that's why he's The Master.\nNow here is where I reveal some of the greatest twists in cinema history; though I sometimes feel that this film has become so well known that many viewers might know what happens before they actually watch it. And that is, Norman's mother is dead and in reality he just has her cadaver and impersonates her at times. All of this is explained in depth by a psychiatrist(Simon Oakland) at the end of the picture, for the benefit of the audience. I probably could spend more time on some of the other brilliant moments in the picture like Arbogast's murder or the final sequence when Sam and Lila make a final investigation and revelation. However, I think enough has been said and those who have seen know, and those who haven't...well you just made a grave mistake reading this.Aside from Perkins and his magnificent performance the film also features Janet Leigh,who was the only member nominated for an Oscar for their work in the film,Vera Miles, the illustrious Martin Balsam and John Gavin at the peak of his contained career.\nOf course I must also mention, if even briefly, Bernard Herrman's score which I would describe to be as vital to the picture as the film it was filmed on.\nSixty years later, Psycho still manages to terrify with the same amounts of thrills and suspense it had upon its release in 1960 and remain as the pinnacle to the horror/thriller genre.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Pinnacle Of Horror", "date": "2021-02-24T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6631443", "sentiment score": [0.0204, 0.151, 0.3725, 0.3966, 0.0594]}, {"content": "This original psycho film by Alfred \"Hitch\" Hitchcock was a masterpiece in my opinion.

This movie shows why. He masters the art of the unsettling, everything screams that something isn't right. This could be from the opening credits not being lined up geometrically like the majority of movies or how he does not even give you the comfort of numbers when describing time or location. The score is also horrifying for the scene, setting the unnerving tone early, as soon as that motif starts. The majority of the movie is long takes and narrow shots. The narrow shots give you the sense of claustrophobia, making you want to step back but obviously you can't. The long takes make you think they're lingering too long, making you feel you've overstayed your welcome and taking awkward to a different level.\nI'm unaware of how Hitchcock makes this possible, but the most average and boring tasks undertaken by our lead, for the first half anyway, make us squirm. Never before have I been so petrified by watching someone buy a car or talk to a police officer, its truly a marvel to watch.\nSo much of the movie is silence, which Hitchcock utilises perfectly. He uses it in 3 ways: To create an awkward/unnerving silence between characters, for characters by themselves and to actually illustrate how quiet it is in a set place. All of these are in the hope, and they do, create suspense and tension between characters and just the environment in general.\nAnthony Perkins' (Norman Bates) ability to create this character that we are so unsure about, leading us at the start to believe he's something we think he isn't but ultimately is. This through the dialogue and through his body language throughout the whole film.\nThe movie is so unnerving that despite there not being many jump scares at all, the one that are there are so scary. The movie has you so unnerved at time that literally the jump between dialogue and silence and vice versa is enough to make your heart skip a beat.\nThe amount of twists implemented through the movie keeps you off balance so well that they, in of themselves, get to you\nI have only seen 5 horror as of writing this (Silence of the Lambs, Psycho, The Conjuring 1&2 and The Nun) so I'm not particularly adept to say this but this could just be one of the scariest movies ever made, it certainly was the scariest I've watched.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Hitchcock at his best", "date": "2021-02-17T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6606129", "sentiment score": [0.1381, 0.5128, 0.2347, 0.0913, 0.023]}, {"content": "Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Today's Hitchcock movie review is the noir slasher thriller Psycho (1960), which to me is so far one of the most iconic films that not only Alfred Hitchcock made but in American cinema. Quick summary of the film before I go in depth analysis, Marion Crane played by the brilliant Janet Leigh is a woman who is in love with a divorced man, Sam Loomis, who might as well be married considering his heavy financial obligations that leave him unable to marry in a practical sense even though he can in a legal sense. So, Crane decides to steal the money of a wealthy customer as an attempt to wipe the debt of her lover and marry him. By stealing the money, Marion leaves her town in a rush to keep the money and finds herself checking in at the Bates motel. There she meets the weird and interesting Norman Bates and there Marion goes missing. With no information on her sister, Lila Crane and Sam go look for Marion along with the help of a Private Inspector.This film is all about the suspense which is executed by its film angles, music score and the composition of the filmmaker's shots. This can be demonstrated with the earliest scenes of the movie, when Marion was leaving town with the money, the angle of the camera switched between her facial expression and the road ahead of. In this segment, the audience can easily tell that the she is worried and panicking about being caught by the law, also by showing the her view we can tell that she is try hard to stay on the road and get further away from her town as she continued to drive in the rain and night. And the music gives the scene a sense of urgency and was played louder when she was near the local police authority. The local police authority in appearance looks like a dark and sinister figure who never takes off his sunglasses and follows Marion. To me this is a great method of someone who seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her.The films main element to me is Bernard Herrmann incredible musical score which just elevates each story within the film in such a way, the effect is hypnotic. The music is literally screaming at you in each scene. From the violent and suspenseful strings to the strings of death, the score just creates a thrilling atmosphere and captured myself really into the story and to what will happen next to the characters, which Hitchcock introduces us in the film.To me the real star of this film other than Janet Leigh is Norman Bates himself, played by Anthony Perkins who always manages to surprise you. From the stolen money plot, we now dive deep into Norman Bates. Whether they are the facial tics or the half-swallowed words, the performance is sensational and Perkins turns Norman Bates into one of the most famous fictional names in film history. Now Norman is a nutcase and you can see this when Norman has his chat with Marion about the hotel, his mother, running away from problems and his hobbies all while you see the taxidermy of animals in the background hanging ominously. Hitchcock deliberately placed the stuffing of animals in the background to emphasize Norman's statement about doing potential harm. Perkins does well with his character by showing us Norman's shyness, his madness, the tenderness, the danger, the cravings of macabre servings all due to being a mamma's boy with hellish implications.The other element is the mystery of Norman's mother, which is revealed towards the ending of this film is a true introduction in the main stream media of split personalities. Once you see the corpse of Mrs Bates, along with the doctor explaining who \"Mother\" is, Hitchcock cleverly helps us to understand what split personality disorder really is. Also for you Snatch fans, look our for periwinkle blue - both flicks had the mother and son dynamic.Overall, this is a great film due to the elements that help to create a suspenseful thriller whether its due to the acting, the writing, the filmmaking, editing or the musical score all without gore.

Along the way, he also creates a couple of Hollywood icons, when he introduces the world to Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Hitchcock always was a man who wanted to do things differently from what other directors did. He always said, that great storytelling comes from showing the audience what will happen. If there is a bomb under the table, then show the audience the bomb. He wasn't afraid to take chances doing things to his main characters, that were unconventional in modern film of the time, in order to draw the most shock from the audience. In the case of Psycho (1960), he delivers that with a punch.A young woman, Marion, who comes into a lot of money, leaves town and ends up off the beaten path at a quiet, but intimidating little motel for the night. She meets Norman, the motel owner and his \"mother\", a woman who Marion never sees, but knows that she is there. She hears Mrs. Bates having conversations with Norman from their house, on top of the menacing hill, overlooking the motel. What happens after this, becomes a major part of film history. For those of you, who have never seen Psycho (1960), that is all I am going to say about the plot. If you have never seen Psycho (1960), you need to. It is important because it does represent a milestone moment in film history, for so many reasons. It is required viewing for film history buffs and cinephiles everywhere.Hitchcock uses all of his camera techniques, editing tricks and his moody uses of light. He completes some of the best composited camera shots ever seen. Also, the use of sound is also used brilliantly in this film. It is the clever use of audio, that really creates the suspense found in the film. Hitchcock uses audio to point out certain plot points, without jeopardizing any of the secrets. It is an excellent way of story-telling. It is the type of storytelling used to create tension and suspense in every scene. It is so successfully executed, that the film knocks you for a loop, especially midway through the film. It is here, that his brilliance shows to us why he never was a traditional director and why he enjoyed crossing the line with his main characters.9.0 (A- MyGrade) = 9 IMDB.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Janet Leigh was born on July 6th, 1927", "date": "2021-01-14T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6473549", "sentiment score": [0.0049, 0.0097, 0.0227, 0.3097, 0.653]}, {"content": "Overall, Psycho is an absolute masterpiece.

It's definitely one of his best, right up there with \"The 39 Steps\" and \"Strangers On A Train\" and \"Sabotage\" and \"Shadow Of A Doubt.\" He only once again came close to making as good a film, with \"The Birds,\" while Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins never escaped the greatness they helped create here. Poor John Gavin had to quit the biz entirely, and became an ambassador.The movie was adapted from a novel so some of the original audience would have been familiar with the plot of the book. In the novel, Norman Bates was a middle-aged man. I think it was a brilliant stroke to have the Norman of the film as a man in his twenties, a boy who never grew up in a man's body. Anthony Perkins is so identified today with his role of Norman Bates that it was surprising to see how endearingly he played him in the early scenes. And he did one of the best stammers I've ever seen in a movie when he was being questioned by the private detective (Martin Balsam) who is also searching for Marion. I also wasn't expecting to see how protective the local sheriff and his wife were of Norman when they were being questioned about him and his mother. You could tell they didn't want somebody (Norman) whom they thought had been dealt a bad hand to have anymore publicity and scrutiny than he already had.I keep using the word brilliant, but I cannot hide my enthusiasm for this movie. It is wholly unlike the overblown, overbudget, overlong fluff spewing all-too-often out of Hollywood today. \"Psycho\" is simple, well-crafted and just the right length.It's easy to take PSYCHO for granted now; it has been imitated so many times in so many ways by far lesser talents. Indeed, it's one negative is that it inspired so may pale imitations, including its own three sequels and a very bad remake. Yet even so, PSYCHO remains a one and only original.

As much as I like Anthony Perkin's performance, I sort of resent that he steals the show. This had the makings of a pretty good film noir; then, Norman Bates lays on the gothic horror story, very effectively so. Marion seems fairly composed dealing with Norman; he's the polar opposite of Sean Connery's Mark from Hitchcock's Marnie (1964). Still, Norman's role, as the blond protagonist's male counterpart, is similar in that he's her shadow, her hidden self.No doubt that nerdy Norman is a good deal more wacky than suave Mark. Not just in manner and appearance, but in the danger posed by their mental conditions. Suffice it to say that both guys have strange hobbies. Both Janet Leigh and Tippi Hedren steal from their employers, more or less as a way to be self-sufficient. But Marion wants to get married, whereas Marnie can't stand men. I might say that Marnie represents Hitchcock's attempt to stay with the female leads story, which in Psycho, diverts onto Norman's track about halfway through.Funny, but macabre bit when Marian's sister (Vera Miles) and Arbogast (Martin Balsam) come calling at Sam's (John Gavin's) hardware store. An elderly lady is considering buying a pesticide, she's wondering whether it causes suffering to the wee critters. With Norman's collection of animal artifacts, she may as well be speaking for him. I don't get how Lila (Miles) knows that Arbogast client isn't going to prosecute her sister. Anyway, the pivotal conversation between the cool Arbogast and the wilting Norman is amazing. \"Did you spend the night with her?\" Maybe the detective should've asked if she took a shower. \"It isn't jelling\" Norman's painfully stuttering story, that is.Anyway, Arbogast, intrepid as he is, returns to the Bates motel; geez, he's going to the old house. He's going into it...well the old lady (?) stabs the private eye. Considering the lurid nature of both murders, I don't see why Leigh's gets way more attention than Balsam's. The sexual aspect of Leigh's murder definitely gives it more impact. Anyway, the good ol' boy Sheriff (John McIntire) doesn't appreciate getting rousted in the middle of the night by Lila and Sam. Still, he's curious about the \"old woman\" both Sam and Arbogast spoke of in the old house.\"You must've seen an illusion, Sam\" he tells the puzzled guy. Naturally both Sam and Lila look into the Bates motel. Norman must be beside himself having to deal with these pesky folks asking questions. They theorize that Norman must've made off with the purloined loot. They find a tell-tale calculation on a scrap of paper, pointing directly to both Marian and the money. Well, Norman can't have anyone prowling around the old house, right mom?Right. The denoument is perfectly staged: the skeletal corpse, Norman in her garb, Sam wrestling with him as Lila freaks out nearby, the swinging lamp animating the skeleton; and the music! It's as tangible as the knife. \"Can I bring him his blanket?\" Says Norman's guard. Although the shrink says in effect that he's become his mother, her voice scolds him, as he sits there listless, ending with a jack o'lantern grin. Pretty much the end.This time around, everything added up for me. Despite my disclaimer about wanting a full-boat film noir, I can see why Hitchcock chose to mix up the noir with horror. In a sense, it's like a sequel to a good noir; we see what happens after the bad stuff happens--that is, even worse bad stuff.If there is a resolution, it may be that Sam and Lila, thrown together in this, may, or could become a couple, compensating partly for Marian's elimination. Although Norman remains the focus even in the last scene, he's already irrelevant; we're back to the everyday world of county sheriff's offices, psychiatrists, Sam, Lila, and the whole rest of normal (not 'Norman') life.I might quibble, as some do, with the geographic details of Marian's trip from Arizona to Fairvale. It takes her an entire evening and into the next evening to drive from Phoenix to the outskirts L.A. (with time out for sleeping at the side of the road). Since Sam has no trouble visiting her from Fairvale when she's in Phoenix, it's hardly as far as all that. Then there's the strange juxtaposition of summer in Phoenix with Christmas time in California; it certainly hadn't taken Marian six months to drive, what, 400 miles? So there's some seams showing in the plot logistics.It's possible that Hitchcock somehow overlooked these time and distance discrepancies. It's more likely that he fudged it; either because he didn't care, or because he implied something else. Maybe the point is establishing, or embellishing the psychological distance between the workaday works of a big city, and the mythic timelessness of the Bates motel. I'm not suggesting that I've discovered a hidden subtext here, but that this illogical bridge between the two halves of the movie can be viewed subjectively, and not simply as some mistakes.Altogether a fantastic, macabre, and creepy movie.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 2}, "heading": "California Charley Scores A Sale Before Breakfast", "date": "2020-11-27T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6316296", "sentiment score": [0.0157, 0.1281, 0.4252, 0.4021, 0.0288]}, {"content": "This film has it all.

Viewed by many as one of the greatest films ever made, there's no doubt in my mind as to why Psycho has such a legendary reputation. Released in 1960, Psycho opened the door for many films in the thriller/slasher/horror genre that would follow. Psycho indices you from beginning to end. Each scene has your heart racing increasingly faster as the film progresses and for a different reason each time. This film draws you in to one situations and then turns you around right into another before you can even realize. Hitchcock masterfully pieces this\nunique story together. I felt Psycho came across as a very complete movie, captivating performances, appealing cinematography, an unsettling score, and just the ability to draw you in is all pretty remarkable. The score alone is enough to make to shutter a little and it is paired up with every scene perfectly. The shots Hitchcock provides have a way of putting the films situation into perspective for the audience. It makes you feel part of the story and takes you on an intensified journey of angst and curiosity. Psycho's performances were convincing all around, but the real gem of this cast is Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. Perkins performance is the backbone of Psycho, Norman Bates is a genuinely chilling character with a lot more too him than just simply being strange. The concept of Norman Bates and his mother adds to this films uniqueness and disturbing feel. 100% recommend, especially to horror/thriller fans who have been holding out.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "We all go a little mad sometimes......", "date": "2020-11-13T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6266663", "sentiment score": [0.0121, 0.0291, 0.0542, 0.2925, 0.6121]}, {"content": "I loved the cinematography of \"Psycho\".

When you're on the run like that and you're filled with guilt it just seems like everybody knows what you did and everybody is out to get you. I also love the transition from protagonist to protagonist after Bates commits the two murders. In the beginning you expect to be going on this long journey with Marion while she's on the run with the $40,000 but next thing you know you're 40 minutes into the movie and she's being stabbed to death in the shower. It leaves you thinking \"where does the movie really go from here?\" And then it transitions to the private detective's perspective of him investigating where she might have taken off with the money.... and then BOOM, he gets stabbed by bates and now the mystery continues. In all honesty I was not predicting either of these murders, and unpredictable events in movies are what make me keep my eyes glued to the screen.

Watching a movie where i constantly had to be thinking something was going to happen made me so uncomfortable but that was i point i guess because honestly it made the big reveal all the better, little teases at something big happening only for the scene to go by leaving an anxious viewer confused and scared of what's to come. The shots in each scene seemed like they served a purpose the longer I looked at something that would've been a shorter shot or a couple of frames the more confused I was. Like staring at the cop across from the dealer was awkward yet helped set the scene of fear for the first victim even though she was committing a crime. The dialogue also does the movie a great justice, constantly referring to rain and dampness, along with the actual rain throughout the movie was a great deal in the vibe of the movie.

Robert Bloch's original 1959 novel was inspired by the real life horrors perpetrated by Wisconsin necrophile Ed Gein, kidnapping his mother's corpse to care for it and despoiling other graves for food or souvenirs (Tobe Hooper's \"The Texas Chain Saw Massacre\" expertly conveyed the sickening atmosphere of such depravity). In refashioning this normal looking, unsuspected farmer into Norman Bates, balding, alcoholic, middle aged proprietor of the Bates Motel built by his mother, the same events play out as in Hitchcock's adaptation, though despite living only 35 miles from Gein's hometown of Plainfield Bloch remained unaware of the actual crimes until it was almost completed (he was amazed at how similar the dynamic turned out to be living out in the country, a puritanical religious fanatic mother whose son acted out in much the same way as his fictional counterpart). Hitchcock purchased the rights for a pittance in an attempt to go against his recent history of big budget efforts with major stars for a small scale black and white production done by his television arm Shamley, apparently inspired by showman filmmaker William Castle. His chosen screenwriter was Joseph Stefano, listening intently to the director's changes with surprise and delight, shifting the initial focus not on Norman but on fugitive Marion Crane, in possession of $40,000 stolen to pay off her fiancee's debts so that they can marry. All Hitchcock had to do was suggest Anthony Perkins for Norman to engage the audience's sympathy, the up and coming 27 year old actor had already been nominated for an Oscar for only his second screen role in \"Friendly Persuasion,\" while casting Janet Leigh as Marion was even better, a lovely and versatile actress whose star qualities could carry the crucial early section and pull the viewers into her 'private trap' (she lost the Academy Award for Best Actress but did win a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress). Another masterstroke was personally appearing on all the posters with strict guidelines on how the film should be exhibited, no one to be admitted after the picture's start: \"I realize this is a revolutionary concept but we have discovered that PSYCHO is unlike most pictures and does not improve when run backwards!\" Topping that had to be the best tagline ever conceived: \"don't give away the ending, it's the only one we have!\" Filmed on the Universal backlot, where the Bates motel would be seen in several episodes of Boris Karloff's THRILLER, it was a reluctant pickup for Paramount to finish off a previous contract (put off by the violence and adult subject matter), not expecting much of a return under Hitchcock's restrictions and no advance screenings yet becoming the biggest blockbuster of his entire career from massive ballyhoo and word of mouth. He wanted to prove that a relatively minor feature from William Castle could have turned out much better with a decent director on a small investment, and in playing the audience like a piano succeeded beyond his wildest dreams...but where do you go from here? Transforming something perfectly ordinary into something terrifying was a challenge he always enjoyed, and would meet with \"The Birds.\" And believe it or not, William Castle himself described his latest plot to screenwriter Robb White, who deemed \"Homicidal\" fairly impressive until he went to see \"Psycho\" and realized that this 'original' idea was a complete ripoff! John Gavin had not seen the last of the Bates Motel, both appearing in the very last episode of THE ALFRED HITCHCOCK HOUR in 1965, \"Off Season,\" directed by a young William Friedkin and scripted by none other than Robert Bloch.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "First seen on Pittsburgh's Chiller Theater in February 1972", "date": "2020-09-20T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6110297", "sentiment score": [0.0228, 0.0537, 0.1132, 0.4254, 0.3849]}, {"content": "This film basically created suspense in films the way we know it.

I love the scene where Marion drives away from Phoenix to Bates Motel. As the situation gets more troublesome in Phoenix, the lighting gets darker and so as actress' face.Mise-en-scene and camera position are exquisite as well. For example, when the private investigator goes up the stairs in Bates mansion, he is not placed in the center but a little left and little lower from the center. This imbalance causes uncomfortableness. At the same time, the background blurs a little bit except for his face. Audience can really focus on his face and be ready for what's about to happen.The score of this movie deserves more than it is already praised. When I decide the quality of the movie as a whole, the role of the sound effects can be minor. However, Psycho's score is the best of all time. It is the main component of creating the thrilling and ominous atmosphere of the whole film. It upgrades this film from great to excellent.The scene starting from the shower to scream is iconic, and it deserves its popularity. Build-up of tension including the score that sounds like scratching the chalkboard, the camera walk, and the shadow is just perfect. However, the scene that Norman cleans up the murder scene needs some attention as well. Without showing the body, blood, or scars, the director manages to create psychotic ambience and to make me nauseous with meticulous description by investing some time into the scene, calm demeanor of Norman, and constant changes of the position of camera angle.Psycho is considered one of the best directing of Hitchcock or of all time. It is just textbook: mise-en-scene, camera angles, lighting, score, and etc. The thing is textbook cannot be art.

Ultimately, it's deserving of its iconic status: this is a truly fantastic film.In terms of personal preference, I don't like this one quite as much as Rosemary's Baby or The Exorcist, which are at the absolute top my list, but this film is worthy of its praise. It was ahead of its time, showing the audience things that had never been shown before (the first flushing toilet in American cinema, for example), it portrayed things that were taboo and often not discussed by the \"polite\" society of the time, and it is perhaps the greatest use of a musical score in history. That grating, screeching music is burned into the collective conscience of society, to the point of some people thinking of that score every single time they step into a shower.Anthony Perkins is a fantastic Norman Bates. There's no question about that. Having just seen the original for the first time, I'm interested to see how he expands and develops the character in subsequent instalments, because there's definitely a lot of potential there.And, of course, we have Janet Leigh, my personal favorite part of the entire film. Mother to Jamie Lee Curtis, Leigh earned the \"iconic horror badass\" crown just 18 years before her daughter would go on to do the very same thing in \"Halloween.\" Janet's character isn't the traditional stupid character that ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time; she makes some bad decisions, but she's intelligent about the way she handles things, which is really nice for a change. Of course, without spoilers (if you don't know by now, you must be new to the genre), Janet is the face of that iconic shower scene, and it truly is one of the best scenes in classic horror history. It's not particularly graphic (dealing with censors back in the day had to have been an absolute NIGHTMARE), but it effectively finds that \"sweet spot\" between showing the audience what they want and pleasing the powers that be.A lot of time has passed since Psycho first came out, but the passing of time hasn't tamed this beast. It's inevitable to view the film a little differently in the light of present day, but it still has the power to raise the hairs on the back of your neck 60 years later.

The unexpectedness of the scene. the quick editing and the shrill Bernard Herrmann score are what make this scene so effective. As for the $40,000, Norman Bates, played by Anthony Perkins, disposes of it while cleaning up the body. This brings me to another great part of the movie, Anthony Perkins' character. He plays his character as a shy, dutiful mama's boy trapped by his authoritarian mother. We genuinely believe that he is just a dutiful son cleaning up after his psychotic mother till the end.

After the lavish productions of Vertigo and North by Northwest, and while noting the financial success of smaller and cheaper B-movies, he decided that he wanted to make a movie for less than a million dollars. He hired a lot of the crew from his television series Alfred Hitchcock Presents and largely unknown actors like Vera Miles (who had played Henry Fonda's wife in The Wrong Man) and Anthony Perkins. Another thing he did to minimize the cost of the film was negotiate a contract with Paramount to reduce his own fee for a percentage of the ticket sales. Thinking the movie wouldn't make much money, Paramount was happy to oblige and Hitchcock ended up making the 2016 equivalent of about $150 million.The thing about this movie as a story is that it's almost an endless supply of red herrings from start until over-explained ending. Janet Leigh's character, the point of view character for the first forty-five minutes of the film, is a red herring. Norman's mother is a red herring. The idea that Norman buried another woman in his mother's grave is a red herring. The money is a red herring. It's not only the audience latching onto things that ultimately don't matter but characters as well as they circle around the problem but only come to the actual source in the movie's final moments. On paper, it feels like a movie that would annoy me rather than entertain me. It's just this side of lying to the audience, but Hitchcock maintains narrative discipline and integrity while playing with us so expertly that he gets away with it. It really is the best single example of what he said, \"Always make the audience suffer as much as possible.\"The thing about slashers is that the genre has completely devolved to the point where the kills are the only important thing and the characters getting killed don't really matter. They're just meat for the grinder. Well, there are only two deaths in Psycho and both are of characters that we actually spend time getting to know. The first is obviously Janet Leigh's Marion Crane. She doesn't even arrive at the Bates Motel for a full half hour. Instead we get her relationship to Sam Loomis, a divorcee who pays alimony and lives in the back of a hardware store, her dreams of running away with him where money isn't an issue, and her job situation where she suddenly gets $40,000 in cash handed to her to place in the company's safety deposit box. Without any dialogue to explain her actions, she simply goes home, packs up her bags (changes from a white bra to a black one) and drives away from Phoenix towards California where her boyfriend lives.She drives, desperate to avoid detection, sleeping on the side of the road in her car, exchanging her car for another in California, and, in a rainstorm, stops at the hotel where she meets the proprietor, Norman Bates. Anthony Perkins as Bates is one of the key special ingredients to this film. From his innocent introduction to the sinister ending, he's complex and endlessly watchable. His first scene, from his greeting of Marion to wishing her goodnight after their small dinner in his parlor, is such a great moment. Despite his innocence, there's something off about him. He's too innocent for his age. He seems boyish instead of just nice, and then the conversation turns to his mother and a darkness comes out of him. This is the much better version of the first scene in Strangers on a Train. There, Bruno was far too aggressive too early for me to sell the ideas at play, but here, Norman Bates is such a disarming na\u00eff for the first few minutes that his dark turn doesn't feel like it should send Marion screaming.Marion decides that her actions were not worthwhile and that she should go back, figuring out how much she owes from the money she used on her trip out, and then she dies. What sets Psycho apart from most modern slashers is that incredible cruelty for Marion because we, the audience, end up on her side, happy that she's going to return back, and then she dies. We spent forty-five minutes getting to know her, watching her make a huge mistake, and then begin to turn around on that mistake before she was taken away. It's emotional investment that's required for us to feel the murder. If she had been on screen for five minutes before her death, there would have been no investment on the part of the audience, but we feel her death and when the investigation of her death picks up in the second major portion of the film, heading by Sam Loomis, Marion's sister Lila, and the private investigator Arbogast, we want the investigation to move forward.And that's really important because of who the actual murderer is. This is where the red herrings play out really well. We're led to believe for most of the movie that Norman's mother is the killer as complex thoughts about Norman's innocence and loyalty to his mother play out. He becomes an accomplice, but his devotion to his mother who's so cruel to him is admirable at the same time. We end up kind of rooting for him, being on his side rather than Sam's when Sam comes to question Norman. It's so effective that as we see Norman in his final shot as his mother's voice speaks in voiceover, we still feel for Norman, lost in the blackhole of his mind to his mother's power over him. So, she ends up truly being the killer, but it's still Norman at the same time.It's Hitchcock playing with the audience, twisting the knife into them about expectations, emotional investment, and denouements. He's playing the audience like a fiddle, and it works so incredibly well. It's experimental, cruel, and wildly effective. For a movie that seems to rely so much on a twist, it holds up remarkably well because Hitchcock knew that it was more than just a twist.

It was his switch from thriller to horror (the famous shower scene). Respected Hitchcock actors had a certain amount of reserve to become associated with this \"experiment\", and so the cast of \"Psycho\" contains lesser known and upcoming actors. For Anthony Perkins (playing Norman Bates) this chance was a \"curse in disguise\". He got never rid of his Norman Bates image.Apart from the cheaper actors the budget for \"Psycho\" was also in other respects more limited then previous Hitchcock movies. This was a deliberate choice. Hitchcock wanted the film to have an unpolished look.As usual Hitchcock has an unusual way to tell the story. The film begins with a theft of apparent main charachter Marion Crane (Janet Leigh). This theft is the reason Marion has to flee, but plays no role in the rest of the story. At around 1/3 of the film Marion is killed and the film has to find another main character.The experiment with Psycho succeeded completely and, as said in the beginning of this review, today \"Psycho\" is the top film of Hitchcock.

Sixty years is a long time to keep a secret, especially when all the most important scenes have been so frequently mirrored.Compelled to operate on an extremely low budget (studio brass had major doubts about the premise), in Psycho, Alfred Hitchcock leans heavily on his finely-honed directorial senses - artistry and atmosphere, primarily - in lieu of a dazzling set or gaudy wardrobe. The end result is a very moody, up-close and personal piece, entirely appropriate for such a character-driven tragedy. Subtext is the rule of the day, whether it's foreshadowing the awful events to come or nervously reveling in their aftermath.Much is said outside of the dialogue, in other words, and in such visually compelling ways! The guiding hand of frequent collaborator (and graphic design legend) Saul Bass is apparent in more than just the dynamic opening credits. Bass may not have actively directed the famous shower episode, as is often rumored, but his tight storyboards and Bernard Herrmann's indispensable musical cues essentially make the scene.

He didn't stop here, though, introducing a strict and unusual \"no late admission\" policy for the film screenings, inspired by Clouzot's Les Diaboliques, not to mention the game-changer of eliminating the female lead, a false protagonist, just before half of movie running time, leaving a very controversial Norman Bates as the only main character.\nUnlikely for Hitchcock, Norman Bates persona is rather closely modelled on the real source of Robert Bloch's novel, Wisconsin killer Ed Gein, who like Norman Bates was a solitary murderer living in an isolated rural location, had a deceased and domineering mother to whom he had built a sealed off shrine in his residence and dressed in her clothes.Notwithstanding all these idiosyncratic deviations, Psycho was an immediate success at the box office and still today is Hitchcock's' movie with the highest cumulative worldwide gross, forcing also part of the critics, originally puzzled by the film, to appreciate its unconventional values and the Academy to nominate it for four Oscars, giving none though and ignoring Anthony Perkins amazing performance.In fact, one of the marvels of Psycho is indeed Anthony Perkins rendering of Norman Bates, making the character the ultimate psycho-murdered, a perverse icon of film history. While homosexuality had already been implied in Rope, Norman Bates' gender dysphoria becomes in Psycho the key element of the story, sublimely as well as subliminally played, most likely helped by his own sexual preferences, by Anthony Perkins, who subtly but unnoticeably reveals it early on during his dinner conversation with Marion, and it is actually plainly explained and theorised, even if maybe too didactically, at the end of the movie, just before the final, haunting close-up on Anthony Perkins' deranged look and female-voiced thoughts, themselves worth an Oscar.

It has everything that you would want in a thriller love making, theft, fear, murder tension and unexpected twists. It's divided into three parts, the theft of the $40K, the aftermath of the first murder and the solution of the crime.Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a secretary to a real estate agent George Lowry (Vaughn Taylor). Marion has been meeting boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin) for some \"afternoon delight\". They are unable to marry due to Loomis large alimony payments. Lowry has been selling a home to Tom Cassidy (Frank Albertson) and the two have been out celebrating the sale. Cassidy insists on paying the $40K sale price in cash and brings the money to the office.Marion is asked to take the cash to the bank, She asks for the rst of the day off and decides to yield to temptation and flees with the money. She heads for the California town of Fairview (I think) the home of Loomis and his hardware store. On the way Marion pulls over to the side of the road to rest.The next morning a Highway Patrol Officer (Mort Mills) in sinister reflective sun glasses questions her. He becomes suspicious of her nervousness. In the next town, Marion pulls into a used car lot and trades her car in. The salesman Charlie (John Anderson) is curious as to why she is in such a hurry. The Highway Patrolman pulls up opposite the car lot and unnerves Marion.Marion proceeds on her way and gets caught up in a rain storm. Only miles away from her destination, she pulls off the road into an out of the way motel...\"The Bates Motel\" There she is greeted by a personable Norman Bates who checks her into her room. Norman offers to make a snack for Marion. She overhears Norman arguing with his mother. When Norman returns, Marion tries to talk the momma's boy Norman into leaving the abusive old lady. He refuses. However in telling each other their troubles, Marion sees the error of her theft and plans to return the money the next day.Marion with a clear conscience, decides to take a relaxing shower when a shadowy figure creeps into the bathroom and unexpectedly murders her. Norman back at the house on the hill, sees blood on his mother mnad rushes to Marion's room. He is shocked at what he finds but decides to protect his mother nad cleans up the crime scene. He places Marion's body in her car and sinks it in a bog behind the motel.A week later, Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) arrives at Sam's store trailed by private investigator Arbogast (Martin Balsam). They both are concerned over Marion's disappearance and feel that she is hiding somewhere in town. They soon realize that something more serious has occurred. They go to local sheriff Al Chambers (John McIntyre) for help. They explain the situation. He informs them that Norman's mother has evidently been dead these past ten years.Arbogast, hired by Lowry, checks all the local hotels for a trace of Marion and ultimately arrives at the Bates Motel. He becomes suspicious of the nervous Norman and decides that he will try to interview Norman's mother. As he goes up the staircase in the house he receives a big surprise.When Arbogast fails to return, Lila and Sam decide to visit the Bates Motel themselves. They immediately become suspicious. While Sam distracts Norman, Lila sneaks into the house in search of Mrs. Bates. Norman overpowers Sam and races to his mother's aid. Lila is searching the creepy old house and descends into the basement when Norman returns. What she finds is the answer to Norman's secret.I envy anyone seeing \"Psycho\" for the first time and experiencing the shocks provided by Mr. Hitchcock for the first time. I mean, how in how many films is the leading lady murdered early in the story?The performances are universally great with Perkins standing out. Leigh and Miles give strong feminine interpretations to their roles. The film is populated with top character actors of the day. In addition to those already mentioned, we have Simon Oakland as the psychiatrist who explains all, Lurene Tuttle as Mrs. Chambers and Pat Hitchcock as Marion's co-worker.

Of course, if it is more true, it is not an exaggeration to say that it is explicit.Because the language of the camera has always been a must-have reminder to the audience: This person has problems and this place is not right.Where is the specific problem and what's wrong? Read on.Let me talk about Cran first. Since Cran decided to run with her boss's $ 40,000 cash, her character traits have become prominent. What is it? It is \"panic\". And this \"panic\" has been running through her character until the moment before she died.On the way to escape, Kran spent the night in the car and was woken up by the patrolling police early the next morning. Her panic look instantly caught the attention of the police: a beautiful woman who parked the car by the road alone overnight, although she insisted that she did not encounter any problems and did not need help, but was very resistant to the police. ask.When the car dealers traded for the old ones, the car salesman had planned to spend a lot of money on the sales. As a result, Cran rejected the proposal to test the car, asked the price straight away, and did not make a counter-offer. There was only one request, and the driver was delivered immediately. This even led the car salesman to suspect that her own car was coming from a wrong direction.The heavy rain was unable to move forward, and Cran had to choose the Bates Motel by the night. At this time everyone knows that the feature film is about to begin. why? Because the audience can guess without any effort, the hotel owner Norman will not only officially launch as a transitional group performance, but as a major player identity.Regarding Norman's character traits, the director didn't hide it, and three or two lines and shots came out. The masked gentleman with a sensitive and emotional instability hides the meaning and is dangerous.So when he peeked at Klein's bath, the audience wouldn't be surprised, because this behavior was in line with Norman's character.However, when it was discovered that Crane was killed in the bathroom, his performance surprised the audience.At first he appeared a little panicked, this is the normal reaction of ordinary people. But the duration of this panic is very short. He calmed down quickly, and quickly packed the scene, the corpses disappeared, a series of actions, too smooth and skilled!But this time, back to the topic I want to talk about. Before that, I have been analyzing the details and hints. Now I can talk about the clever and misleading part, because the audience's sense of violation appears.The murder happened, the next step is to confirm who the murderer is.Who is it? The motel is equivalent to a closed space during a downpour night. In this space, there are only three people, the victim tenant Cran, the motel owner Norman, and Norman's sick, but full-hearted mother .The audience's first impression was that Norman was first ruled out, and the murderer could only be Norman's mother. why? Because we all heard, Norman's mother didn't like Cran, she had the motivation to kill.Drawing such a judgment means that the previous details hint that it has come into play, and the audience is misled unconsciously.However, there must be evidence for convictions, and we cannot guess by sentiment alone. So the audience looked down and found out that Norman 's mother was an elderly person with no mobility and resistance. How could such a person kill a young woman and a middle-aged man with a knife What?By this time, the audience actually had a vague guess as to who was the real murderer, only to wait for the movie to explain why the murderer did this and how.Finally, we know who raised the knife, but we are not sure who the murderer is.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 2}, "heading": "On the Misleading of Details", "date": "2020-04-21T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5660641", "sentiment score": [0.17, 0.3383, 0.2476, 0.1868, 0.0573]}, {"content": "In my cinema class, our weekly unit was on Hitchcock films.

I always think of these two being connected, it must be because I discovered them close to one another as they've nothing in common. Psycho has that edge that The Birds doesn't really bother with, largely I suspect because of the shower scene and the abundance of stabby stuff. It's a much smaller cast and simpler in its aesthetic, also black and white. I adore the black and white though, I can't imagine it in colour, one of the many reasons the remake was unwatchable. It starts of course with Saul Bass' cool tiles, maybe only rivalled by North by Northwest in Hitchcock films. Saul Bass is a genius. I'll admit I'd forgotten quite a lot of the early scenes, the scary policeman, the voice over exposition as Marion Crane leaves the city in her car, on the run with her ill gotten gains. It's all about the motel and the house though isn't it, but as we get there that fateful stormy night and as much as I love the shower scene, it's Arbogast's interrogation of Norman that always felt more of a pivotal scene, as Norman gets caught in his lie and his (or his mother's) crime begins to unravel. The tension built with the noir P.I. and his death scene on the stairs I always thought was cooler than the shower... although credit to the shower, Tomasini's cutting is superb. I'd forgotten also quite how much happens away from the Bates Motel with Marion's sister and boyfriend trying to find her and the money she stole, but again this all just helps to make the pacing work as well as it does. Psycho always feels dumbed down to Janet Leigh's famous demise and Bernard Herrmann's groundbreaking score, but there's so much more going on and I love Anthony Perkins' performance. Hitchcock characters can often feel a bit flat, all surface, the lights are on, but Perkins as Norman is genuinely creepy and nails pretty much every scene... apart from maybe that last one as he bursts into the basement with his mum's frock on. Psycho is far from Hitch at his best, but it's still a gripping watch.

Just this: If you've never seen it, you owe it to yourself to do so, not because it's a way of paying homage to the one true master of modern film, but because it's so fun to watch.Janet Leigh plays a bored office drone who decides to steal some loot from her boss's obnoxious client and parlay it into a new life with her all-too-distant boyfriend. All is going more or less according to plan until she stops in at the wrong motel, where she befriends a friendly if somewhat nerdy desk clerk only to find it causes problems with that clerk's possessive mother, who as her boy explains, \"is not herself today.\" I'll say she isn't, and so would Leigh's Marion Crane, who maybe should have put up that \"Do-Not-Disturb\" sign before taking a shower.You can feel the decade literally shifting out of '50s and into '60s with this one. Even the opening shot, where the camera looks over a Western U.S. city in the middle of the afternoon and zooms in on what looks exactly like the Texas School Book Depository overlooking Dealey Plaza. Norman Rockwell touches abound, like the decor of the motel, but look at what's going on around it. People dress well, they still wear fedoras and jackets, but in their tense conversations and hooded gazes you can feel the culture just ticking away like a time bomb waiting to explode.Most especially, there's Anthony Perkins, who plays motel clerk Norman Bates in a very oddly naturalistic way, complete with facial tics and half-swallowed words, not the polished image one expected to see then. Just compare him with John Gavin, who plays Marion's boyfriend in the standard-actor-of-the-day way. Perkins manages to be so weirdly magnetizing, even in small moments like the way he stumbles on the word \"falsity\" or notes how creepy he finds dampness to be.He shines in bigger scenes, too, like his tense chat with Martin Balsam's boorish but diligent private detective character, Arbogast, who along with Perkins and Leigh delivers a landmark performance. The way both actors play out the awkwardness in their conversation makes you literally sweat. Then again, you're always uneasy around Norman. You definitely feel wary of him right away, but you find yourself liking him, too, even when he's busy covering up \"Mother's\" misdeeds. Not since Bela Legosi played Dracula did you get a horror movie with such a compelling central figure.If you are sampling the many other comments here, be sure to look up Merwyn Grote's. He makes an interesting, compelling case for how director Alfred Hitchcock used his television series as a template for \"Psycho.\" Certainly \"Psycho\" looks more like early 1960s television than any of the more sumptuous fare Hitchcock had been bringing to screen at the time. Not only is it in black-and-white, not color, but the sets; a ramshackle motel, a mothbally old house, a couple of cheap looking bedrooms, a bathroom in a used-car dealership, are deliberately low class.It's thrilling to see Hitchcock move so effectively outside his normal element, and move things along with such clinical detachment and low-key technical finesse. Thrilling, too, to realize this is one of his most accomplished products; made by a man who was experienced enough to know how the game was played, and daring enough still to break the rules; indeed, start a whole new ballgame.Is it the best Hitchcock movie? It's definitely one of his best, right up there with \"The 39 Steps\" and \"Strangers On A Train\" and \"Sabotage\" and \"Shadow Of A Doubt.\" He only once again came close to making as good a film, with \"The Birds,\" while Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins never escaped the greatness they helped create here. Poor John Gavin had to quit the biz entirely, and became an ambassador.Often imitated, parodied, referenced, and analyzed to death, \"Psycho\" still isn't played out nearly 45 years after it came out.

However, Marion sees this as the perfect opportunity to leave her old life behind and start afresh. After driving for a long period of time, Marion decides it's best to get a good night's sleep and checks in to the Bates Motel which is run by mild-mannered Norman and his domineering mother.I watched this film for the first time a number of years ago and remember being totally blown-away by it. Well it's fair to say that time has mostly being kind to this film as it is still quite an experience.Hitchcock wasn't called the master of suspense for nothing; of course much of the suspense comes later when we get to the Bates Motel, but there is one scene earlier in the film involving a policeman that achieves this effect with no dialogue (it literally is just a police officer staring at Marion from across the road, but it still managed to be pretty creepy). I also thought the voiceovers of conversations that are taking place in Marion's absence discussing her behaviour, motives etc were an excellent touch. A lot of filmmakers would have cut back to the office or to the car sales yard so we could see these people talking, but seeing it as a voiceover whilst Marion was driving was more suspenseful and tense and was a good move by Hitchcock.However, it's when the action moves to the Motel when the film really picks up a gear and this is mainly down to the wonderful duo of Hitchcock and Perkins; Hitchcock with his masterful direction in which he leaves a lot to our imagination (I remember the first time I watched this film how much I wanted to see inside the Bates house and how I was on the edge of my seat when Martin Balsam starts to creep up the stairs). However, in front of the camera the film most definitely belongs to Perkins and I think what I liked about his character is that, despite his nature, there is a certain vulnerability about him. Instead of being cool, calm and emotionless when under scrutiny he starts stuttering, mumbling his words, avoiding eye contact etc which are traits your average Joe would exhibit under the same sort of pressure. His nervy performance mean you don't always feel the way you should feel about him. Add to all this the wonderful score by Bernard Herrman and you really do have one hell of a film here.I originally rated this film with the perfect score when I last watched Psycho (which was before I started writing reviews).

The plot has a lot of elements that make it great, such as the many surprises it contains that keeps the viewer intrigued.

Norman is a very dynamic character; in the beginning of the film the viewer would see him as a poor hotel keeper trying to make a living. As the film progresses the viewer can start to see the weird things Norman does and they start to question his character until the end when they realize what is actually going on.

I can certainly understand why. I personally love watching movies and could watch them ten times over and still not be bored. I truly enjoyed viewing this film and was interested the whole way through. Although, I can admit that certain parts of the film were not as enjoyable, but I think that is just because of the age of the film. I couldn't find much at all to complain about this film. That aside older movies are truly unique because it shows the building block to where we have come today in the movie world. Psycho is an outstanding film because it gave me a variety emotions all throughout it, I found myself irritated, on edge, and truly shocked. While viewing this film I caught myself almost yelling at the TV because of what the characters would do. Ms. Crane is a great example because while she was alive in the movie she seemed to make every single wrong and stupid move possible. For example, when she fell asleep in her car on the side of the road and the officer came up to her window the first thing she does is jolt up and start the car. This instantly makes her look incredibly suspicious, which is the last thing she should be doing considering she just stole 40,000 dollars. In my opinion I think Ms. Crane is so stupid the whole time she is alive, but every thriller needs a victim. This is also her character that Hitchcock gave Janet Leigh to play the role of. Ms. Lane is definitely the protagonist in Psycho because what we can take from the movie as in what she says and does. When I was watching the movie I was on edge waiting to find out what happens next. I couldn't believe that an old black and white film would have me as interested as I was. Ms. Crane goes through pretty much the entire movie struggling with her internal thoughts, which gives the film internal conflict. Hitchcock incorporated this element to convey how guilty Marion felt about taking the money. Even though Psycho is an older film, it's really amazing how it can still capture the attention of a modern day audience. When Norman's \"mother\" was sneaking up on Ms. Crane in the shower I found that to be very suspenseful. Hitchcock did a great job at building suspense for the viewers of Psycho. This movie also really shocked me because I wasn't expecting this old 1960 horror film to be such a great movie. This was the first time I have seen this movie and I really enjoyed it, when at first I was critical. Psycho was a great film in my opinion and I took a lot from this viewing experience.

The voyeur scene, the abrupt killing of a main character, and the entire concept of the mental condition were all very original in 1960.The cast is fantastic, from Perkins (who should have gotten an Oscar) and Janet Leigh (easily my favorite Hitchcock lead actress) all the way down to that cop who stops for Leigh and then later stares at her so perfectly from across the street while she's with the used car dealer.There are so many other little moments of tension: Leigh's employer seeing her in her car when he thought she was going home, the car that doesn't sink into the swamp all that easily, and the searches into the ominous old house. There are also those big moments too, a couple of which need to be included in any discussion of the greatest scenes in film history. The other aspects of the film keep up too - the score is brilliant, and Hitchcock gets plenty of great shots, including the one from the underside of Perkins's face while his jaw twitches nervously and many others.

Psycho is definitely a Thriller with a capital letter. It is indisputable that it is quite difficult to judge the films that have passed through time, because of our impregnation with the culture of modern cinema. In addition, many Hitchcock classics may seem quite ordinary black and white picture. This happens to people whose eyes fundamentally do not perceive black and white classics. I must say that they lose a lot. Me same this the film hit immediately.In General, I tend to evaluate the film, first of all, from the point of view of acting. I would like to highlight Anthony Perkins ' performance. Let me remind you that his hero is a psychopathic killer who lives as a hermit, creating even more fear about his image. It is necessary to pay tribute that such an image of the main characters of horror films, in turn, is often used in modern horror, which, above all, speaks of the classics of this picture. To be honest, the game Perkins hooked me not childishly. So I watched, literally with my mouth open. This eye that draws you to the screen, monotonous and at the same time sharp movements that speak about his unstable psyche of his character and cause a contradictory first impression, the famous smile - all these details, observed by both Hitchcock and Perkins, deserve praise. And what the film's production and acting do together is difficult to describe in words. I am a fan of non-standard acting. Expressiveness and emotionality used by actors is alien to me. Most of all in the game I like realism, when purely individual qualities of the actor help him not to overplay, that is, to adhere to the Golden mean. Perkins, for the most part, manages to intrigue the viewer thanks to his incredible male charm.As for the work of Vera miles, the role of the weaker sex in A. Hitchcock is, first of all, the embodiment of femininity, which brings its unique charm to the picture, and therefore, speaking about her game it is difficult to find fault or comment on something. Women are an integral part of Hitchcock thrillers, and to me, her acting is no different from that of grace Kelly or Joan Fontaine. In his works, they act on a special pattern-either in danger or in the arms of a man. Thus, women in his films are an integral attribute, but not the basis.Speaking of the film as a whole-it is certainly a masterpiece. It's all so coherent, clear and while watching there is a strange feeling that you-not the only observer, for the most part, because of the use of unusual angles. And, of course, the saddest thing that makes me think about this kind of classic is that such films are one of a kind and some techniques in modern cinema are no longer used.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "cool", "date": "2019-11-09T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5245924", "sentiment score": [0.0177, 0.1623, 0.3768, 0.3665, 0.0767]}, {"content": "Psycho stars Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins and is directed by Alfred Hitchcock. The story revolves around a Phoenix secretary who is on the run after stealing $40,000 and checks in to the Bates Motel. This is my favorite horror movie and is also Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece. I could really feel the passion he took to make this horror masterpiece instead of making a horror-movie-of-the-week. Also I want to point out that making a horror movie, a horror movie doesn't need to be in color all the time. A horror movie can have any color tone and still tell an interesting story, which is where Psycho succeeds, and having the black and white tone to it makes it more dark, ominous, and spooky. I felt that tension all around this movie as every department cranks their category from 0-100, that I was sucked into the world of Psycho. Norman Bates is my favorite serial killer. The reason why he's my favorite serial killer is because unlike most serial killers depicted in horror movies, Norman Bates doesn't try so hard. When we first meet him he's charming, handsome, and he's very friendly, but that scene where he and Marion are having a conversation, he becomes a slightly different person, and that's when we realize that something is not quite right with him. And maybe this is just me, but even though he's a serial killer, I still feel compassionate towards him in some twisted way, that made me believe that he isn't a bad person after all. But what I find genius is that the script tricks us into believing that Marion is the main character, but it isn't until the second act, that we realize that she isn't the main character anymore. Its as if the script department were separated into two categories where one half was responsible for developing Marion's character, while the other half was focused on the events after Marion's death. I know I've posted spoilers about this movie, but this movie is too good to pass up on some spoilers. So in the end, this is my favorite horror movie, and I would defiantly recommend this to anyone who is interested in the horror genre.

There aren't many old films that are still relevant decades after their release, but if there's one it's definitely this thriller. It's the textbook example of suspense and classic horror and in terms of excellence still unreached. It's known that Hitchcock was way ahead of his time and it really shows. How many other films from the early sixties start with a woman only seen in her bra? Also the shower scene shows a lot of nudity compared to the standards of that time. It really shows how daring the director was in his directorial style. To be honest, it all was for the better. The film may have a longer first act that introduces us to a side character, but simultaneously he tricks us into thinking that Marion Crane is the protagonists and makes her death (one of the best scenes) shocking and gives it even more momentum. But in the context of the whole film the storytelling is absolutely well paced and never loses it's perfectly balanced level. Additionally, the virtuoso score by Bernard Herrmann, probably the epitome of suspense, supports the overall enthralling atmosphere from start to finish, sinks it's teeth into your head and won't let you go until the film has ended. The most notable thing about this film though is Anthony Perkins' portrayal of Norman Bates. I've never seen such an incredible performance, he perfectly masters every single character trait of his disturbed nature, as he plays both the shy and somehow insecure manger of a motel and the insane and malicious psychopath, with a strange and oedipal relationship towards his mother, with such excellence. To be honest, this is one the best representations I've seen in my entire life that personally inspires me as an aspiring actor. Just the way he manages to dominate a scene for almost 15 minutes without saying a word, only with his mimics and charisma are enough to prove my thesis. Also the final stare into the camera in the end literally gave me goosebumps. Besides this one-man show, the supporting actors still deliver great work nevertheless, but Perkins stole everyone's show. With unusual camera angles the director thoroughly captures the haunting atmosphere of the horrifying story. Next to iconic scenes, the final twist is one of the most magnificent conclusions of all time. All in all, this horror classic is as outstanding as it's claimed. It combines all, a packing plot, a haunting atmosphere and superb actin and in the end, I sat there with tremendous joy and awe. A day later, I still think about how awesome it is.

These elements, along with the efforts of the rest of the cast and the excellent screenplay, combine to make a thrilling cinematic experience like no other. 10/10.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Still a Masterpiece", "date": "2019-10-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5171675", "sentiment score": [0.0059, 0.0107, 0.0251, 0.1519, 0.8064]}, {"content": "I am only 16 years old, but this is an amazing, beautiful, classical, most creative thing I have ever seen.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "This is a must see!", "date": "2019-10-06T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5167703", "sentiment score": [0.0013, 0.001, 0.0038, 0.0452, 0.9487]}, {"content": "Another classic Alfred Hitchcock directed film from 1960 featuring one of the most iconic scenes in cinematic history.\nIt may be over fifty years old but a good story holds up no matter what.

She loves a handsome gentleman named Sam (John Gavin) but, alas, his divorce has left his prospects dim, as a good deal of his money goes to his ex-wife. In fact, he lives in another California town, behind the hardware store he runs. Marion is getting tired of meeting Sam in cheap hotels and listening to his weak promises. One day, a crooked businessman comes in with $40,000 cash for a house he is buying for his daughter, who is marrying soon. Marion's boss is aghast to hold this much money so he sends Marion to the bank on a Friday afternoon. The money never gets deposited. Going a bit \"crazy\", Marion takes the cash and runs north, thinking this will allow Sam to marry her. But, a heavy downpour makes Marion stop at an out-of-the-way motel, The Bates. Greeted by the motel's owner, Norman ( a superb Anthony Perkins), Marion soon learns she is the only guest and is given the best room. Norman even brings her a meal, over the objections of his mother, who Marion sees in a window and hears from the 'big house\" behind the motel. After she eats, Marion decides maybe she should take the money back in the morning and steps into the shower. Suddenly and ghastly, Marion is stabbed to death by, its assumed, Norman's mother. Norman cleans the place up and sinks Marion's car, along with the money, into a pond near the motel. All too soon, Sam and Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) are looking for her. A private eye goes snooping, too, hired by the man with the bucks, for he can't notify the police. When the PI gets to the Bates, Norman's mother makes short work of him, too. Another car goes swimming and sinks. But, when Sam and Lila likewise trail Marion to the Bates, will more deaths ensue? Is there bigger secrets afoot? You bet! This classic tale of a psychosis and murder is rightly one of Hitchcock's most famous films. DEFINITELY SCARIER THAN SCARY, many folks never take a shower again after viewing it.

Crane is a real-estate secretary and a huge purchase is made in cash. Her job is to take the $40,000 to the bank on her way home.

The fact that Anthony Perkins did not even receive an Oscar nomination for his multi-layered in-depth portrayal of Norman Bates is beyond mind-blowing to me.The music as well by Bernard Hermann is truly one of the greatest not only in the history of horror, but of all-time films.

It was such an iconic scene which made Hitchcock known as a master of making such a horror masterpiece. It wasn't just a horror movie, it was also a thriller and a mystery which made us really curious about the crimes. We always wanted to know who commited it, who was the victim and what clues were left behind.\nIt was about a Phoenix secretary embezzles forty thousand dollars from her employer's client, goes on the run, and checks into a remote motel run by a young man under the domination of his mother. Hitchcock's Studio, Paramount Pictures, wasn't sure enough and disliked the film so they denied him a proper budget and the it was $800,000. The movie was in black and white. They even built a Bates Motel mansion at Universal. Psycho was Hitchcock's best work while he had done some thrillers and horrors like Rear Window (1954), Vertigo (1958) and The Birds (1963). All of those were one of Hitchcock's greatest works.\nHitchcock also made rules for audiences for watching this film.\n\"You must see PSYCHO from the very beginning. Therefore, do not expect to be admitted into the theatre after the start of each performance of the picture. We say no one -- and we mean no one -- not even the manager's brother, the President of the United States, or the Queen of England (God bless her)!\"\n-Alfred Hitchcock-\nThey were really strict and lucky for me, I'm not a person from the 60s so I can watch whenever I want.\nThe performances were excellent and I mostly like Anthony Perkin's role of Norman Bates. Perkins was good-looking and that's exactly how Hitchcock wanted it to be just like that so Bates would look like a very likeable person with a charming character and made audiences believe him. They would think about him. Bates even disguised before he kill so that the victims would think it wasn't Bates maybe? He could have not dress because the victims would be dead and they wouldn't know. The way the iconic scene: the shower scene was pretty scary with its noise and when Marion Crane opened her eyes dying made the scene more terrifying and the way she was buried in the swamp was mostly frightening. She was naked and her things were in there. I knew it would be a good idea to bury your victim like that. What a genius! The story was told in a unique way. Even though the movie didn't have much violence, but the mystery were also dreadful and made us worry about what really had happened. It's also a great idea to shoot this movie not in technicolor but still remained black and white. That way would make Psycho a horror masterpiece no one could make like that.\nPsycho was really influential, the greatest work of Alfred Hitchcock and also the greatest horror movie and it still deserved that title until today, it's still terrifying and scared a lot of audiences. It's also a combination of horror, terror, violence, mystery and thriller.

Much like Hitchcock's The Birds, the eerie silences create tension and suspense leaving the viewers in anticipation of what might be coming next. Hitchcock further immerses the viewer into a state of suspense with clever editing that accentuates the character's perspective and puts the viewer in the place of the characters on screen.Psycho follows the story of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and the unfortunate events that follow her meeting of Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Marion Crane works a normal day job in Phoenix, Arizona but is unhappy in her romance with the Sam Loomis (John Gavin). Sam is facing a great deal of debt and doesn't have the financial means to get married. On one normal day at the office, Marion is asked to make a $40,000 cash deposit on her way home from work. Marion decides to pack her suitcase and take the money in hopes that this will allow her and Sam to run away together.Once on the road, a heavy rainstorm forces Marion to lose her way on the road. She decides to stop at an isolated hotel off the road. Marion checks into the Bates Motel and meets Norman Bates. Norman is a seemingly nice young man who tends to the hotel and his ailing mother who lives in the house just behind the motel. Marion and Norman have a meal together and after hearing Norman's tale and thinking about her own decisions, Marion decides she will return to Phoenix with the money in the morning.Unfortunately, while Marion is taking a shower a shadowy figure enters the bathroom and stabs her to death. Norman runs to the room and discovers Marion's lifeless body lying on the floor. He collects her belongings and with the body, loads them in the trunk of her car and disposes of the vehicle in a local pond. Weeks later, Lila Crane (Vera Miles), Marion's sister, arrives to speak with Sam to determine whether he knows the whereabouts of Marion. The two are approached by Private Investigator Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam) who has been hired to return the money to Marion's employer.Milton Arbogast is convinced that Sam and Lila are unaware of Marion's location and he decides to start checking on all the roadside motels to determine if she stopped anywhere. Milton Arbogast finds his way to the Bates Motel where he meets Norman Bates. After a tense conversation, Milton discovers that Marion had indeed stayed at the motel. He finds a pay phone to let Sam and Lila know that he will be checking in with them, but that he had to check out the hotel again. Milton Arbogast decides to check out the home above the Bates Motel to speak to Norman's mother. As he walks up the staircase, a woman comes out of a room and murders him.Sam and Lila go to search for the missing Arbogast and arrive at the Bates Motel. They meet Norman and create a ruse for Sam to occupy Norman, while Lila goes to the house to look for Arbogast. Norman figures out what's going on and knocks out Sam. Meanwhile, Lila searches the house and finds nothing. As she hears Norman entering the house, she hides in the basement. In the basement, she finds the corpse of what appears to be Mrs. Bates. As she screams, we see Norman wearing his mother's clothes coming at her with a knife. Sam arrives just in time to stop Norman. The police take Norman into custody, where we find out Norman's mother personality has taken over his mind.Psycho is an excellent film that will keep the viewer on the edge of their seats. The audience will delve into madness with Norman and make you forever cautious of stopping by a roadside motel.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "A Descent Into Madness", "date": "2019-05-05T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4830095", "sentiment score": [0.006, 0.0355, 0.3252, 0.5672, 0.0661]}, {"content": "One of the greatest films ever made, by one of the greatest directors in movie history.......\nJanet Leigh stars as Marion Crane, who embezzles $40,000 from her employer and goes on the run. When she becomes tired whilst driving in the rain at night, she pulls into the 'Bates Motel' and meets Norman Bates, played by Anthony Perkins. Unfortunately, Marion's stay isn't as relaxing as she'd hoped and she is murdered whilst taking a shower.\nThere are so many things about this film that make it a genuine classic, from the direction to the brilliant cast and acting.\n'Psycho' was so influential to future horror/slasher movies in so many ways, but what Hitchcock did so well was to make Norman Bates so opposite to the usual depiction of murderers in movies, he's not the typical unattractive loners who have difficulty in communicating with anyone, on the contrary, Anthony Perkins is a handsome guy who is very charming in this film, and Hitchcock makes him almost likeable, sensitive and makes the audience quite sympathetic towards him. When we first meet him he is so sweet-tempered and mild, and during a conversation with Marion we learn that he is under the control of a harsh, disciplinarian mother and is almost traumatised by her to the point that, despite being a grown man, he is almost child-like and this is made clearer by a line he says to Marion, 'A boy's best friend is his mother'. We even hear 'Mother' belittling Norman and shouting at him, seemingly jealous of any attractive female guests, and we then get that famous shower scene of 'mother' killing Marion.\nThe shower scene is still as effective as it was in the '60s when the film was released, especially with Bernard Herrmann's chilling score.\nThe way Hitchcock builds the suspense in this film, and how he overturns our expectations is unparalleled. The violence in 'Psycho' by today's standards is actually pretty tame and most of it is, in reality, down to the sound effects and the viewers' imagination. And this is what Hitchcock always insisted on, that any 'horror', and the 'scares' comes from the suggestion of violence. It's the way the audience's brains fill in the gaps of the things we don't actually see, that's what's scary, cause no matter what any film-maker can show, it can never be as scary as what our imaginations can come up with.\nThis movie didn't just have a surprise twist ending, or violent murder scenes, it told its story in a very unique way. Killing off the leading lady so early in the film, the sparse amount of characters, the remote location, the build-up of the tension all these were completely new to audiences at the time, and even today we don't see this done so often, and certainly not done as well as Hitchcock did it.\nNearly 60 years on from its first release, 'Psycho' remains incredibly influential and still very thrilling and scary.\nA true 'classic' in every sense.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 2}, "heading": "A true 'classic'", "date": "2019-05-01T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4819881", "sentiment score": [0.0057, 0.0154, 0.0293, 0.2611, 0.6884]}, {"content": "\"Psycho\"- A review of Hitchcock's slick, insight into an alternative psyche.\n\"Psycho\" is Hitchcock at his finest, the film was realised in 1960 and was met with staggering adversity. However, as the years passed people recognized it as a masterpiece. The plot centres around a women named Marion (Janet Leigh), who embezzles a large sum of cash, in order to run off with her \"star-crossed lover\". However, midway through her excursion she decides to check into a vacancy for the night at the elusive \"Bates' Motel\", run by the reclusive Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins).\nOne of this films aspects that deserves an abundance of acclaim is its spine-chilling and accurate portrayal of a psychopath. Hitchcock masterfully manipulates the mind of the audience into perceiving things which are not actually shown on screen. Primarily in the notorious \"shower scene\".\nHitch's direction is magnificent and seamless, the characters are well established, the film is littered with cleverly thought out and well placed symbolism and to conclude it all a jaw-dropping/disturbing twist, which will haunt you for the rest of the evening.\nIn conclusion, those looking for a mindless \"slasher\", then \"Psycho\" is not the film for you! \"Psycho\" may be classified as a \"horror\" but in my mind it will always be a \"psychological thriller\".

You can look at the gazillion reviews here for that. Overall I would give the movie and 8.5 to 9.0.I'm going to use this review to make a few criticisms because no one seems to talk about that in their reviews. One of the recent reviewers had an interesting perspective. They thought that the movie dragged in the middle. I didn't see it that way. I thought the beginning was very weak. I didn't like it at all. The whole scene in the hotel room at the start was not entertaining in any way for me.There were a lot of little things in the movie that seemed silly to me.One of those was when Norman was clearing out the hotel room after the murder. The last thing he removed from the room was the newspaper that had almost $40,000 dollars in it. There is absolutely no way that someone could pick up a newspaper with all that money in it and not realize there was something in it. He would have needed to hold it together too in order to stop the money from falling out.Another was the camera work for the killing of the detective. I know Hitchcock is much admired for his camera work but the close up of Martin Balsam struggling to not fall backwards down the stairs looked ludicrous. In fact it looked very similar to a scene in another Hitchcock movie, Vertigo, except the scene in Vertigo wasn't this ridiculous. It took as much time for Balsam to fall down the stairs in this movie as it did for someone to fall from a tall building in Vertigo.The biggest problem with the movie by far was finding out that the mother had been dead for ten years and that Norman was himself and also acting as his mother because he had a split personality. One hour, ten minutes, and 27 seconds into the movie, bother Norman and his mother appear in the same scene. I never see where anyone ever mentions this. This is clearly an attempt to make you think that Norman isn't crazy and is not dressing up and acting as his own mother, but how do you justify this?

He played the system on this one i think, knowing back then the hays code back then was just terrible. Some parts of the movie he will have you thinking and another part he will have you shaking in your boots. Back to the hays code part of this, you have to admit he did slip through the cracks a bit on this one. The code was extremely strict back then not letting homicide,suicide or even nudity be shown back then. He did not put any in there explicitly letting it be shown. Yet he did let you know what was going on in obvious ways , such as showing blood running down a drain and other things of that nature. This movie was outstanding in my opinion . Every dark vs light aspect was just right showing characters in dark clothing to be evil or crooked, and lighter colored characters to be loving and good. Even the small things like the Mcguffin he got just right in my opinion , you didn't know the importance of it until he wanted you to and that was the crazy thing about this movie, i think every actor and actress played their parts very well.

About something that has been appreciated, raved about and even worshipped for nearly 60 long years by audiences, devotees and eventually even critics?There are reasons for all that. John Gavin may have been wooden but Vera Miles was good enough, Janet Leigh and Robert Balsam were exceptionally good and Perkins was sensational. It was Robert Bloch's best achievement in lurid pulp, Stefano's best screenwriting moment and Hitch was quite literally at the height of his powers. So were his wife Alma and assistant Peggy, who also sensed how times were changing and how the audiences were ready for something never before attempted or seen - a film with moments so pounding and visceral that it would end up changing the entire ballgame.And then there's the score, equally deeply ingrained on our culture. \"Hitchcock does about two thirds of his films - I finish them for him\" - Herrmann would say, and it's been true from Harry through to Marnie. This one contains the most famous musical cue of all times and a neurotic, hurtling main title to boot, but it is the slow bits, during which Hitch handles the passage of time, trouble, unease, mystery, suspense and degradation that are just superb, allowing for some of the most exciting moments ever commited to film. Elegant and decidedly modern, all the more lethal for its reduction to a chamber string orchestra, the score is well produced too; loads of sticky reverb and compression were slapped on those ferocious shrieks, making them always sound a bit limp on later recordings - and certainly lacking that thoroughly ripping effect. Luckily, Hitch gave in and went along with his composer.To wrap it up - the less said about Psycho, the better - and it is best enjoyed in silence and darkness.

I'm going to try to avoid any spoilers in my review of this mess, as people seem to care about it, but honestly there is so little to this movie that there isn't really anything to spoil.The first hour of this movie is extremely boring. Everything is dragged out to pad the runtime. The entire opening scene doesn't even have anything to do with anything that happens after. Towards the middle of the movie, there is a scene in a shower that is so poorly edited and acted that it left me laughing hysterically. I'm pretty sure the scene was supposed to be scary, but honestly I can't see anyone being on the edge of their seat from a performance like that. After that scene, a detective character shows up, and he is kind of interesting, but he dies after less than 10 minutes, so it's kind of pointless. The movie remains mildly entertaining after that, but it's not amazing or anything.The main thing that makes me hate this movie is the closing scene. The truth about the villain is revealed in an exposition dump that lasts like 5-10 minutes. The reason why I don't like it is because this could've been a very interesting plot point that could've been developed over the course of the movie, but is instead just relegated to a plot twist. If we had spent the movie following a villain like that, it would've been really interesting, or maybe even scary. You could say that they didn't do this because they were focusing on the victims, but this movie has no character development. No one grows over the course of the movie, and you don't learn about the personalities or backstories of pretty much anyone.The filmmaking is ok. It's competant. Nothing special. The only interesting shot that stands out is one around a staircase. That's it.Overall, this is a really boring, pointless, and meandering movie with a wasted concept.

The biggest impact featured here is the film's technical prowess since the Black & White cinematography is so gorgeous and so sparse in that we see so little that the suspense is just dripping off the screen. One of the best examples of this is the death of the investigating officer where he's just calmly walking up the stairs when we see a door open ever so slightly on the balcony unseen, and then the killer walks out and stabs him which causes him to fall down the stairs. The way that he falls is so creepy because he falls in such a supernatural way that it just sticks out in contrast to the rest of the material around it. It reaches the level of technical highlight just as much as the infamous shower scene that includes probably the most famous death scene in film history without violence or obvious nudity. The rest of the technical qualities here are just as impressive which really shows the genius was known for the time it was made where it is a sign of good filmmaking of giving the viewer just enough to give them a little jolt whenever it comes into question with the rest of the scene. Many people know of the relationship between Norman and his mother, and the very first time we know of her when he's talking about her in the parlor room is a perfect example of that which is one of the creepiest scenes by the way he's saying things and how he's saying them that something's off and yet he keeps an air of respectability that lends itself perfectly to his character and the relationship between them which is rather creepy. Even the motel where they're staying is like that. The dark interiors, the weird stuffed animals along the walls, and the secrecy that surrounds it is remarkable that most of the time we are wondering the secrets behind it. That allows the film to really get a lot of suspense out of so many scenes that it has the effect of being able to draw in a viewer and really highlights the fantastic work in the later half as the ruse is unveiled with the sequence down in the cellar. Armed with one of the finest and first twist endings in the genre, there's a lot to really love with this one that holds it up over the one main minor flaw. The biggest letdown from this one is the fact that the film does stumble a bit in the middle half where it slows down to a rather bland and sluggish pace as it focuses on her sister trying to find someone to go with her to look into the disappearance. These scenes don't really maintain the kind of impressive atmosphere or pacing that the rest of the film completely excels at. This one does slip down to a rather minor degree as the various starting points to the later half and it's not that enjoyable to sit through.

And I'm sure most of you have seen (at least in part) the famous \"shower scene\". But when was the last time you really sat down and watched this film? It had been awhile for me and I walked away with the following impression:PSYCHO is not all that scary, but it is suspenseful as heck with strong Direction by the \"Master of Suspense\" and very strong performances anchoring the front and back end of the film.PSYCHO was billed when it came out as a \"Janet Leigh Film\". So, to give this review context, let's look at who Janet Leigh was at the time. Before shooting PSYCHO, Leigh was generally cast as the ingenue and/or love interest in mainstream fair such as LITTLE WOMEN, ANGELS IN THE OUTFIELD and HOUDINI (a modern \"comp\" to her might be someone like Anne Hathaway before she started doing \"edgier\" work). Leigh did show that there was more to her than just being an ingenue when she played the morally ambiguous wife of Charlton Heston's character in Orson Welles' TOUCH OF EVIL. This film (probably) gave Hitchcock the idea to cast Leigh in PSYCHO.When 1960's audiences first saw Leigh on screen in PSYCHO, I'm sure that most of them were shocked for, instead of being the pure and wholesome ingenue and wife, she plays the entire first scene in a bra and slip. Her character, Marion Crane, is not morally ambiguous, she is morally corrupt - and when Leigh's character has a chance to act on her moral corruptness, she jumps at the chance. The rest of the first half of this film is Leigh trying to get away with her \"crime\". She is quite good in this part of the film and was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting Actress (deservedly so).And then...Anthony Perkins shows up.We are about 45 minutes into the 1 hour and 49 minute film when Perkins' Norman Bates first appears on screen and an interesting thing happened - I couldn't take my eyes off of him. I was enjoying Leigh's performance but instantly pushed her aside (and to the background) when Perkins shows up. Without giving plot away, let me say that there is much, much going behind Norman's eyes and the performance by Perkins strongly suggests this, without going over-the-top or being melodramatic. It is a perfect blend of actor, character and performance and I was shocked that he was not even NOMINATED for an Oscar (Peter Ustinov would win for SPARTACUS). Perkins performance is one of the all-time greats with one of the most interesting and unusual characters - and portrayals - of all time.Much of the credit for Perkins' and Leigh's strong performances have to go to Director Hitchcock who was at the height of his Directing powers (and power). From the \"get go\", you can feel the Director's hand in this film, building suspense from scene to scene and shot to shot, first with Leigh's character and, later, with Perkins. Both characters are trying to get away with something and Hitchcock pulls his camera in close to make a point - from a distance all seems good, but when you get up close, you can tell that things are very bad, indeed.The filming of the famous \"shower scene\" is well documented and is a Master Class in film and editing. It is worth the price of admission on it's own - as is a scene on a staircase with Private Detective Arbogast, played by Martin Balsam. Hitchcock chooses to heighten the realism in this scene on the staircase by going a more esoteric route (rather than traditional filming of the events) and, one can argue, it doesn't belong in this film. Until, that is, you think about it and then it makes great sense and absolutely, positively has to be in this film in that way.Another aspect of this film that begs to be mentioned is the Film Score by the great Bernard Herrmann - Hitchcock's regular collaborator. The music in this film punctuates the action on the screen - from the persistent beat and pacing of the opening credits music - driving the audience forward into the action - that does not let go, reaching it's peak and crescendo in the shower scene and then floating down gently like an animal catching it's breath after great activity.Does the entire film hold up almost 60 years later? Almost...but not quite. Most annoying to me was the \"wrap-up\" scene at the end where a character spells out everything for the audience. As if we are not smart enough to \"get it\" - and perhaps the audiences in 1960 weren't.But that is a quibble for a film that is a classic and is one that, if you have not seen (or seen for awhile), begs to be seen.

But PSYCHO was made when nearly all top quality directors were making movies routinely for adults. It would be another 8 or 10 years before studios would discover the youth market as perhaps an answer to their financial woes. Flash forward to the present when adults have to hunt for the elusive independent, unpublicized gems that are available today for them.\n Hence this thriller makes the audience wait 45 minutes for the first scare. That script would never get shot today. But when that scare came, it was a pip- killing the star off half way through! Something new had happened here, and Hitch became the first to insist no one be admitted to the theater after the movie had begun. At that time it was common for patrons to walk into movies at any time and stay to see the start of the next show up to the time they \nhad come in. Hitch changed the way audiences went to the movies.\n It suddenly became okay for major stars and directors to develop nasty or violent projects that would always be a thorn in the side to conservative producers. Eight years after PSYCHO, Bonnie and Clyde would break new ground too with its technicolor bloodshed in that film.\n After all these years, it's still painful to decide which of his films is his best.

Hitch claimed he could make a better film than AIP for less money than they spent on a film, and Wasserman took him up on the bet. \"Psycho\" was made for $80,000 using Hitch's television crew instead of his usual cinematic crew. Hitch was always fussy about his leading ladies, and he selected Janet Leigh for the role of Marion Crane, who agreed to play the role for half her usual salary. Anthony Perkins however, as Norman Bates, is the central character of the film, and while his interaction with Marion is minimal, he will forever be remembered for his performance here. Vera Miles, one of Hitchcock's favorite actresses, plays Marion's sister Lila, creating tension over her concern for her sister's well-being. Of Hitchcock's total body of works, \"Psycho\" is the film that stands out in most fan's minds as his greatest. Everyone involved here did their absolute best, and the results are obvious on the screen. The only flaw in the film is the distortion heard in Bernard Hermann's music score. The score exists by itself without the film and is available on LaserDisc, LP and CD, however it's distorted on every medium. Hermann re-recorded the score as a suite for a 1969 Decca/London Phase 4 stereo vinyl release called \"Music from the Great Movie Thrillers.\" The LP has been reissued on CD as \"Great Hitchcock Movie Thrillers\" and lacks the distortion of the mono recording in the film. SPOILER: Of note to trivia fans is that the sound effect of the knife used in the famous shower scene was created by using a Cassaba melon, and in no shot of the rapid 45 pieces of film fired at the viewers does a knife penetrate Marion Crane on-camera, and the effect of the blood running down the drain is actually Bosco chocolate syrup.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "The greatest thriller of them all!", "date": "2018-07-26T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4254194", "sentiment score": [0.0897, 0.2511, 0.2671, 0.3214, 0.0708]}, {"content": "A-Z Horror Movie of the Day...\"Psycho\" (R - 1960 - US)Sub-Genre: Slasher/Thriller\nMy Score: 8.3Cast=7 Acting=10 Plot=8 Ending=10 Story=9\nScare=7 Jump=6 F/X=7 Intense=9 Twist=10A Phoenix secretary embezzles $40,000 from her employer's client, goes on the run, and checks into a remote motel run by a young man under the domination of his mother. \"I think I must have one of those faces you can't help believing.\" This was where Alfred Hitchcock to the line you could not cross in censorship and buried it behind the Bates Motel.

Connective tissue scenes in the film which have the misfortune of resting before and after some of the best moments in horror can feel a bit mundane by comparison. There is an unevenness that has become more pronounced with repeat viewings, as I find myself looking forward to the best moments rather than enjoying each on its own merit. It may be a consequence of the fact that this is a film that is somewhat heavily reliant on its mystery and eventual twist, with many moments dedicated specifically to throwing the audience off the scent. Once you've seen the movie, the tricks take on a transparency that betrays the slightly shallow nature of the story. The execution makes up for these shortcomings convincingly, but Hitchcock has certainly made other thrillers that are much richer thematically (Rear Window, Vertigo), and less reliant on a central gimmick.Regardless, Psycho absolutely shines in its best moments thanks to the excellent performances and Hitchcock's masterful direction.

His 1958 offering, \"Vertigo,\" took time to find its audience but today is recognized by the British Film Institute's \"Sight and Sound\" magazine as the single greatest motion picture ever made; 1959's \"North by Northwest\" is surely one of the all-time great entertainments; 1960's \"Psycho\" practically jump-started the modern-day horror industry all on its own, and remains the director's most well-known film; and 1963's \"The Birds\" is still a baby-boomer favorite to this day. But of those four films, all of which reside on my personal Top 100 Favorite Films list, it is the third, \"Psycho,\" that remains my favorite after all these years, and indeed, I personally feel it is the greatest bit of work that the so-called \"Master of Suspense\" ever gave to an unprepared world. The film was a far cry from its predecessor, \"North by Northwest,\" a big-budget movie that had been shot in lavish wide-screen VistaVision and Technicolor and featured a sweeping, transcontinental story, replete with action and comedy and Cary Grant at his suavest. By contrast, \"Psycho\" was filmed on the cheap, utilizing Hitchcock's crew from his television program \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents\"; the entire production was completed in just a few months at a cost of a mere $800,000 or so. But such was the power of the film, and its clever advertising and promotional gimmickry that insisted that no audience member would be allowed admission after the picture had started, that the box office for \"Psycho\" was enormous: around $50 million, a smashing amount of money for the time. And did it ever deserve it!I generally try to not include spoilers in these little minireviews of mine, but in the case of \"Psycho,\" I will go on the assumption that everyone knows the big reveal that comes at the picture's end, while at the same time endeavoring to be a bit coy, for the sake of those poor unfortunates who have NOT seen this masterpiece. As most of the world seems to know by now, or should, the film shows up what happens when a pretty secretary, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh, in perhaps her finest hour), who works in a Phoenix real estate office, absconds with $40,000 of the company's money and hightails it by car to meet her lover, Sam Loomis (future U.S. ambassador to Mexico John Gavin) in California. Forced to take refuge during a sudden downpour, she stops for the night at the lonely Bates Motel, meets its gawky and awkward proprietor, Norman Bates (Tony Perkins, in the role that made him a star), and is later knifed to death--apparently by Norman's mother--while taking a shower in her room. (This, by the way, was not the first film to depict a woman being attacked while in the shower; indeed, just two years earlier, in the film noir \"Screaming Mimi,\" Anita Ekberg had been attacked in a similar manner, but the difference was, hers was an outdoor shower, with somewhere to escape to, and she was NOT killed during the attack.) Worried by her sister's disappearance, Lila Crane (Vera Miles) arranges to go with Sam to investigate. The two hire a private detective, Milton Arbogast (the great character actor Martin Balsam), to help in their investigations, and the trio eventually tracks Marion's disappearance to the motel, where they discover the grisly secrets that it hides.A bit of personal history here...and I may be revealing my age a bit by doing so. I am old enough to remember when \"Psycho\" was first released, in June of 1960, although I was just a wee lad at the time. I remember seeing the trailer for the film in a theater, although I did not realize until many years later, when I saw the trailer again as an adult, what it had been. And I remember the effect that this film had on many of the grown-ups in my neighborhood, particularly on one woman, Tika, who would not take a shower again for many months after she first saw it. The picture, of course, was a genuine shocker for film audiences of the era. Never before had a movie star of the magnitude of Janet Leigh been so suddenly killed off...and just 40 minutes into the picture! Today, naturally, anything goes, and any star can be unceremoniously knocked off in any manner. We've pretty much seen it all at this point, what with the advent of slasher flicks and torture porn films, but back in 1960, this kind of thing was brand new. People today just cannot imagine how shocked and stunned the 1960 audiences were at the time; what a sensation this film was. The word of mouth was terrific, leading to the box office figures mentioned above. As a youngster, I took all this in but of course was not allowed to see the film by my parents. It wasn't until I was in my very early teens that \"Psycho\" was first shown on television, and by then, I was more than primed. Thus, having been dared by some friends that I would not have the courage to ever see this film alone, I sat down to do so one night. My parents and sister, for some reason, were not in the house, and I manfully plunked myself down on the floor and watched this celebrated horror legend on my ownsome. After all, I figured, I'd already seen 1959's \"House on Haunted Hill\" any number of times (a good preparation, as it turned out!), and how much scarier than THAT could this picture be? Well, the shower scene of course frightened me, as did the shocking murder of Arbogast on the stairs (one of Hitchcock's greatest set pieces), but it was the final revelation of Mrs. Bates in that damp and musty fruit cellar that really got under my skin. Still, I made it to the end, and breathed a huge sigh of relief; I had made it all the way through, and had something to discuss with my friends. In the intervening 50 years or so, I have watched \"Psycho\" God knows how many more times on both the big screen and small, and it never seems to get old for me. (That, by the way, is the hallmark of all of my Top 100 films; the fact that I can watch them over and over and over with undiminished enjoyment.)Today, \"Psycho\" manages to hold up very well indeed, despite the fact that we are all aware of the film's secrets and know just when the jump scares are about to pop out. At this point, there is very little to say about the film that has not been said before. It has probably been discussed and analyzed more than any other Hitchcock film, and the books and articles written about it are legion. As a matter of fact, just last year, a new documentary, \"78/52\" (respective references to the number of setups and editing cuts), was released that centered on just the shower scene alone! I could certainly not improve on any of those commentaries, but would especially recommend to those who are interested Danny Peary's very informative article on the film, to be found in his indispensable reference book \"Cult Movies 3.\" (It was Peary who first made me realize that the film gives us a woman named Crane who becomes the victim of a man who likes to stuff birds, and how the director makes his audience feel guilty by making us all feel like voyeurs throughout the picture.) The film contains so much to love that it is difficult to know where to begin. But let's start with the wonderful script that Joseph Stefano--who would go on to even greater fame a few years later as producer/writer for the classic TV show \"The Outer Limits\"--was able to come up with, based on Robert Bloch's 1959 novel. (Interestingly, the Norman Bates character in the novel is something of a big fat slob, on the order of a Victor Buono type; thus, Perkins was a very unlikely choice to play this particular role.) It is a wonderful script, witty and penetrating, that intersperses its shocks at just the right moments, and is perhaps never better than in the telling scene in which Norman and Marion converse in the parlor before she takes her good-night shower. The actors in the film are all marvelous, down to the smallest bit parts, and Hitchcock's manipulation of his audience, and the way he moves and places his camera (as in the spiraling descent into Marion's dead eyeball after the murder, and the overhead shot of Mrs. Bates attacking Arbogast), are by now legendary. Perhaps best of all, though, is Perkins. What a wonderful job he does here! Notice his hips sway as he ascends the stairs in the creepy Victorian mansion that is the Bates home, or the look of fear and then relief on his face as he attempts to sink that corpse-containing car in the nearby swamp. Amazingly, the audience sympathizes with him as he covers up for his homicidal mother, and that is no small feat. And, oh, let's not forget one of the most key elements in the entire film, that sensationally frightening score by the great Bernard Herrmann, composed solely of strings (violins and cellos); surely, one of the most instantly recognizable film scores ever created, and so very influential on future composers for horror pictures. \"Psycho\" was a groundbreaker and a trendsetter in many departments, but here's something that you may not have heard before: It was also the first film that ever showed the inside of a toilet bowl, a fact that caused all manner of uproar among the decency and censorship groups. (Isn't it funny what some people will choose to get upset about?) I could go on forever about this film, but I will leave you with this one fun fact: The shower curtain that I have right now in my bathroom at home is a clear one, and come to think of it, I have been purchasing see-through shower curtains for many decades now. Is this a subconscious effect brought on by this truly remarkable film? Could very well be! After all, if the Bates Motel had featured clear shower curtains in its rooms, Marion Crane might still be alive and well today....", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "The Modern Horror Era Begins", "date": "2018-06-21T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4211094", "sentiment score": [0.0106, 0.0231, 0.0515, 0.2918, 0.623]}, {"content": "Although I found the film compelling enough, it is obviously a bit dated.

After driving all night in pouring rain, she stops at the Bates motel off the freeway for a night-in, and meets the nervous, bumbling Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who is quite taken with her upon first sight.

Beautifully shot in black and white and carried by an unforgettable score from the late Bernard Herrmann, Hitchcock in all his genius draws us in with a twisted concoction of sex, murder and madness, never letting us forget even to this day that real horror may be right around the corner.

At her job, Marion decided to steal the money of wealthy customer as an attempt to wipe the debt of her lover, Sam Loomis, in order to marry him. By stealing the money, Marion left her town to keep the money eventually going to the Bates motel and meet Norman Bates. With no information on her sister, Lila Crane and Sam looked for Marion, they too encountered the Bates motel. After seeing the corpse of Mrs.Bates, it is revealed that Norman Bates killed Marion; however, the murder was not done by Norman, but by his mother's persona that he adopted when she died.One of the best component about the movie is the suspense that the movie provided to its audience, which was executed by its film angles, sound track, and composition of the shots. Looking at the first suspenseful moments of the movie, when Marion was leaving town with the money, the angle of the camera switched between her facial expression and the road ahead of. In this segment, the audience can easily tell that the she is worried and panicking about being caught by the law, also by showing the her view we can tell that she is try hard to stay on the road and get further away from her town as she continued to drive in the rain and night. In addition to the camera switching angles between Marion and her perspective, the background music gave the scenes a sense of urgency and was played louder when she was near the police that pulled her over. Making the viewers believe that she was going to be caught. At the Bates motel when Marion encounters Norman, the suspense that the movie can display shined when the two characters alone at diner. Here, Hitchcock had the camera angled in a way to make it seem like Norman is looking down at Marion and the audience, while he discusses the situation about his mother and what he would like to do. Simultaneously, the composition of the scene and music added to the suspense. As viewers see Norman talk, the taxidermy of animals can be seen in the background hanging ominously. Hitchcock deliberately placed the taxidermy of animals, the stuffing of animals, in the background to emphasize Norman's statement about doing potential harm to his mother and death. By talking about how his mother would become cold and lifeless, viewers are able to imagine his mother being dead; in addition, the taxidermies were used to foreshadow that Norman's mother is already dead. Lastly, the low violin tune played when Norman stated his view on institutions gives viewers the idea that he has a spite towards institution, and would potentially do something to Marion because she mentioned it. All of this made viewers in suspense as they think that Norman may attack Marion.Even though the examples that I used to mention the suspense that the movie is able to demonstrate well were from the beginning of the movie, it does not decrease the ability that the movie displays. In order for a movie to be successful, the movie's beginning needs to be executed well to capture viewers like how this movie was able to do with its tune of suspense.Hitchcock knew his components of film well because he made this film a huge success; evident by future films, even recent ones, which make reference to this movie, showing the impact that the movie was able to do on cinema as a whole.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "A film to influence horror films for generations", "date": "2018-02-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4056223", "sentiment score": [0.0052, 0.0151, 0.0749, 0.5059, 0.3988]}, {"content": "My favorite of Hitchcock's films.

This film follows a young Phoenix secretary named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh). She embezzled forty thousand dollars from her employer so she can get away with her secret lover. During this, she tries to avoid a police officer that is suspicious of her by taking back roads and stops at the Bates Motel. She meets the owner of the motel, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). At first, he seems like a polite man, but as the film moves on she becomes unsure of him and his intentions. My nitpick with this film comes from the beginning of this film. In the beginning of this film, Alfred Hitchcock does a great job of establishing the character, as he always does. The beginning of this film uses the setting, her job, the things around her, and all the smallest details of her character to do so. This makes her stealing the forty thousand dollars feel like a very believable move for the character. Hitchcock continues to do this and it pays off as the character sees great development throughout the first half of the film. Although, as this happens, this film is simply without an identity and even when Norman Bates arrives on the scene, you can't help but wonder what kind of film your watching.This is quickly shoved aside when you learn what kind of character Norman Bates is and what his intentions are. From here on the film feels perfect. Bernard Herrmann gives a chilling score that becomes even more effective in the second half of the film when it compliments intense murder scenes and Anthony Perkins terrifying performance. Anthony Perkins simply gives one of the best performances ever. He gives a truly disturbing one that still keeps the viewer wanting more. Anthony Perkins takes over this film by himself.The second half of this film moves smoothly and is very unpredictable. This film boasts great character development, an unexpected and fulfilling plot, and one of the greatest performances ever seen on film. This film has one or two negatives that are only nitpicking and doesn't take away from the film. For me, this is a near perfect film, but this is mostly due to Anthony Perkins performance.

It is the genre that's taken the least seriously. Its true that this is the single worst genre of all. Horror movies are clad with a over-abundance of blood, death, bad acting and no point. Of course horror is supposed to make people scared, but 95% of them fail. While Psycho is not scary like it was 57 years ago, it is still one of the smartest films ever made. And the type of genre that the genius film is, happens to be horror.Psycho is best known for the infamous \"shower scene,\" something everybody knows about. That happens to be the turning point. The movie is very good before, and even better after. The \"shower scene\" is not even the best part in the movie.Psycho starts off normal drama with a romance story worked in. Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a secretary whose life could be better. Her fianc\u00e9e is Sam Loomis (John Gavin) and their wedding is on hold due to his debts. She is willing to start life anew and steals $40000 in cash. This happens minutes into the movie as it turns into a road thriller. She plans on evading Phoenix and use the money to build her new life with Sam in California. She knows what she did was wrong and is scared of being caught. We the audience hold our breath in hopes of Marion not being nabbed. Tired, she stops in the Bates Motel just for the night. She meets and gets to know the timid owner, Norman who has a domineering mother. She sees that Norman has low self-esteem and has a change of heart. Can her self robbery get redeemed?Then the film REALLY switches gears and becomes the horror movie it promises. There's the \"shower scene\" that derails the movie away from Marion stealing money and into Norman Bates. The \"shower scene\" had many cuts and changes of angles, with perfect cinematography so that the figure of Mrs. Bates would not be seen. Norman is devastated, but loves his mother dearly, getting rid of the evidence.Marion's sister Lila and Sam hire a detective to search for her. Lila and Sam are worried since they haven't heard from Marion, and they found out about her stealing the money. The detective checks out motels, ultimately landing at Bates. Norman's agitation and inconsistency has him suspicious. Lila and Sam make their way to Bates. They discuss Marion's situation with others in the area and wonder who killed for the money. When they find out Norman's motives and who his mother really is, the level of genius that this flick has kicks into overdrive.When Norman gets sent to an insane asylum, a psychologist explains his mental state. This is the best scene in the movie. One of my 10 favourite scenes in all of cinema. Norman and his mother (who really was domineering) lived as though they were the only two people in the world. She started dating again ten years earlier and Norman killed them both. Unable to cope with her death, he keeps her corpse well treated and acting like she was still alive. But that wasn't enough, he created an alternate personality of his mother and would sometimes dress up as her to maintain the illusion. Since he was jealous of her and her lover, he assumed she would be too. So when moments of passion would arise in Norman's life, the \"mother\" part of him would take over and kill. Norman fell in love with Marion and \"mother\" killed her. He had not idea about the money. If Norman felt any real sense of danger, the \"mother\" part would kill. \"Mother\" the detective. The \"mother\" part has consumed Norman's life.The whole flick is a psychological lesson in the mind of a madman. There are many other instances of intelligence that branch off. Although far from being the scariest film ever, it should still forever remain the best horror film ever.4/4", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Finally, A Horror Movie With Actual Brains and Really High Intelligence!", "date": "2017-11-11T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3855107", "sentiment score": [0.1693, 0.5245, 0.2014, 0.0835, 0.0214]}, {"content": "This Film, Alfred Hitchcock's Highest Grossing and most Famous, has been Deconstructed to Death.

The film is practically flawless starting with a sinister performance by Anthony Perkins. It doesn't take long once we meet him that something is definitely amiss with him. That's one of the things that Hitchcock does so well is he constantly cranks up the suspense, and twists our nerves and minds until it can't be tightened anymore than he lets loose.

In that part, policeman picked on her action and shadowed her car with his car. It seemed that his tailing is persistent, but anything did not happen after all. I have another instance. She had been driving in heavy rains until she has arrived at BATES MOTEL. Maybe, the audience thought that something would happen, but it was just heavy rains. Anything have never happen. Are those Hitchcock's mischief? I thought he had kidded the audience. Next, I noticed about Psycho's soundtrack, \"The Murder\". This tune is pretty shrilling. People tend to feel the nervous to the register. So this music matches \"Psycho\". And it is exaggeration that this music makes the film become famous.

Janet Leigh's Marion Crane created a movie landmark with her shower scene. Bernard Herrmann and his strings created an extra character that we recognize as soon as it reappears under any disguise but, what shook me the most now in 2017 is Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates.

It would have been nice to have experienced the film without any knowledge of the plot twists. Unfortunately, for most viewers, the big surprises are not possible since so many of the scenes are part of our popular culture.There were, however, so many unexpected surprises. The opening scene with Janet Leigh and John Gavin in the hotel room was amazing and (pardon the clich\u00e9) so real. Hitchcock and Janet Leigh did a brilliant job of pulling us into Marion Crane's story, that of a woman in love with a divorced man who might as well be married considering his heavy financial obligations that leave him unable to marry in a practical sense even though he can in a legal sense. He doesn't even have a proper home - just a room in the back of the store he owns. Marion is then seemingly set up as the center of the movie as she thinks she has found a solution to her problems - a felonious one. Then the focus is skillfully shifted to the Norman Bates character as the \"protagonist\" victimized by his insane mother (or so it seemed) and then the focus is shifted once again to Marion's sister's search. The movie was adapted from a novel so some of the original audience would have been familiar with the plot of the book. In the novel, Norman Bates was a middle-aged man. I think it was a brilliant stroke to have the Norman of the film as a man in his twenties, a boy who never grew up in a man's body. Anthony Perkins is so identified today with his role of Norman Bates that it was surprising to see how endearingly he played him in the early scenes. And he did one of the best stammers I've ever seen in a movie when he was being questioned by the private detective (Martin Balsam) who is also searching for Marion. I also wasn't expecting to see how protective the local sheriff and his wife were of Norman when they were being questioned about him and his mother. You could tell they didn't want somebody (Norman) whom they thought had been dealt a bad hand to have anymore publicity and scrutiny than he already had.This film is mentioned in the documentary \"Moguls and Movie Stars\" as an example of how films were becoming more like TV as the 60s began - spartan art design and a script that was bold in the amount of sex and violence it had, even if the vast majority is implied. You have to be impressed by the versatility that is Hitchcock. Making movies in England? No problem. Making movies in the American studio system? No problem. Modernizing to deal with the evaporation of the production code? Again, no problem. Weird factoid - for you TCM fans out there Robert Osborne is credited as \"man\" in Psycho, although I don't remember him ever mentioning it. The only person it could possibly be unless he never comes close to having his face on camera is the parson as the sheriff and his wife are exiting church.

Some might say that it even invented the genre. What is perhaps even more interesting, however, is how different this film is from the rest of Alfred Hitchcock's directorial efforts--and different for the better.For a very basic overview, \"Psycho\" sees young secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) steal a large sum of money from her employer in hopes of starting a new life with boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin). While escaping the city in the dead of night (and the pouring rain), Crane pulls into the Bates Motel, owned and run by one Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). What Marion, as well as a private investigator (Martin Balsam) and Lila Crane (Vera Miles) later on, discovers is that Norman is hiding a deep and terrible secret revolving around his beloved \"mother\".In most other Hitchcock movies, the plot revolves around some sort of MacGuffin, or object that pushes the plot along. In short, less plot-heavy and much more a showcase of the stars, styles, and tropes of the time they were made. \"Psycho\" initially looks to be much of the same, what with the money that Marion steals pushing the action in the early goings. But then she makes that fateful turn into the parking lot of the Bates Motel and everything changes. From that point, the film swiftly pivots into a master class on the building of mystery, tension, and intriguing characters. In other words, it becomes a true psychological thriller that holds up 60 years (at this writing) after its theater debut.Front and center in this genre transformation is Perkins' performance as Norman Bates, easily one of creepiest (and thus most iconic) acting jobs in cinema history. The way he turns on a dime from jocular goofball to menacing madman is truly a sight to behold. Norman's characterization has to be absolutely perfect to sell the big twist at the end, and Perkins nails every scene.In a historic sense, \"Psycho\" is also a landmark film for some of the material portrayed on-screen (at least at that time). From the small stuff (the first time a toilet was ever shown flushing on the big screen, believe it or not) to the infamous shower scene and cross-dressing, Hitchcock was far ahead of his time with this one. During an era when the cinema was still considered family-entertainment diversion, for the most part, he provided perhaps the first true chilling experience sitting in a theater seat.Even more impressive about \"Psycho\"? Sometimes, when any film achieves such a high degree of popularity, it loses a bit of its edge because every scene, character, and line gets dissected a thousand times over. In this case, though, \"Psycho\" can be watched at fairly regular intervals without getting too stale. Hitch's masterful directing probably has a lot to do with this. Even if you know what is coming (and most people by now do), it is still creepy and compelling.In short, \"Psycho\" is a seminal film of American cinema for its character studies and raw thematic material when its contemporaries, generally speaking, were much lighter and sometimes little more than vehicles for their stars. Whether the first time or the twenty-first time watching this gem, you will pick out \"just one more thing\" that amazes you, as well as experience that \"creepy-crawly\" feeling regarding the goings-on at the Bates Motel.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Very Different From The Rest Of The Hitch Collection", "date": "2017-03-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3657323", "sentiment score": [0.0089, 0.0736, 0.2918, 0.5367, 0.0891]}, {"content": "PSYCHO is a psychological thriller with elements of horror in which tension is gradually giving way to a sort of creeps. It is based on the novel of the same name by Robert Bloch.During a lunchtime in Phoenix, a real estate secretary discusses with her boyfriend how they cannot afford to get married because of his debts. Forty thousand dollars in cash accidentally come into her hands. This is a great temptation for a young and unhappy woman. Her boss asks her to deposit the money in the bank. She instinctively takes the money and plans an escape to a new life. California is a famous destination of most of the fugitives. She has, because of the strong cuff, decided to spend the night in a small motel. A pleasant dinner with an attentive owner of the motel will be the last in her life...The story is very tense and shocking. It has offered some of iconic climax in the genre. Mr. Hitchcock did not give up from a classical narrative. He has managed, regardless of the situation and the probability to transfer tensions from one character to another. Hitch has paid attention to small details. The secret of the main plot lies in these details. A ghostly atmosphere has completely corresponded with violence, deviant behavior and sexuality. The soundtrack is excellent. All the protagonists are changing throughout the film. It is a kind of trap by Mr. Hitchcock. Compassion and understanding toward one of the antagonists in the film are certainly possible. However, a viewer loses a firm stance with regard to any kind of identification with the main antagonist. We hear a voice of the killer, we know some of his features, we are witnesses of his murder, but we do not see a clear character.Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates has offered an excellent and intriguing performance. The duality in his character has reflected through a family melodrama, violence by parents and a psychotic obsession. His unpredictability and alienation can cause a fear and admiration at the same time. Janet Leigh as Marion Crane is quite convincing in the role of an insecure and nervous woman. Both characters are in strong conflict with themselves. Norman has struggled with obsession and fear. Marion has tried to overcome her own passion and discomfort. He is completely disturbed person, who can not make decisions alone.

Few are unaware of the iconic shower scene and the shrill string instrumentation that accompanies it, whether they have seen the film or not. The production values are, without exception, exemplary, even though the film was made on a comparatively small budget and largely with a television crew.The expressive and natural performance of Anthony Perkins in the role of Norman Bates launched his career and dogged him for the rest of it on account of his subsequent typecasting. Janet Leigh as Marion Crane convincingly betrays an increasing sense of alarm at her immoral behaviour and her helplessness at preventing it. Bernard Hermann's score, which adds tension throughout the film, even to seemingly innocuous scenes, has been rightly singled out for praise, not least from the director himself. I doubt whether a better reproduction of the sound of stabbing someone with string instruments is possible. The music for the main credits sets the tone for the film, foreshadowing the drama, danger, and violence that punctuates it.The cinematographer uses black and white film to its full advantage. The result is, in my opinion, as impressive as the film's score. The lack of colour robs the film of vitality and warmth, creating a sense of dread in the viewer. Shadows and darkness provide cover for illicit deeds or an elegant way of framing images. In a memorable scene, the long shadow of various birds of prey makes them appear alive and even more frightening, as if they were ready to attack the character or, by extension, the viewer who shares her perspective.The shower scene deserves a special mention. The scene occurs in the middle of the film, at a point when viewers have become absorbed in the story, forgetting, if only slightly, that what they are watching isn't real. Shooting the scene from the perspective of the killer was a stroke of genius. A tranquil scene of a woman enjoying a warm shower greets the viewer. The woman even begins to hum jauntily. Immediately the viewer feels as if he shouldn't be spying on this woman, much less pulling back the shower curtain. Soon they see themselves stabbing her relentlessly and viciously. Hitchcock grants the viewer no respite as the murder is shown from a multitude of angles. The jarring montage of violent images frightens and disturbs. Indeed, one would be forgiven for looking around the room afterwards to see whether there are any murderers lurking in the shadows. The dissonant strings, at once, accentuate the helpless cries of the woman and the violent rage of the killer. The scene concludes with a close up of the lifeless eye of the woman. The eye may signify the viewer's vicarious participation in the murder through watching it, confronting him with his perverse enjoyment of the gruesome scene.Psycho does have its flaws. The exposition at the end of the film is superfluous as the climactic scene provides the same information, obviating the awkward insertion of an ad hoc monologue. The scene in which a character falls down stairs, which, to be sure, would have thrilled contemporary audiences with its groundbreaking special effects, has not aged well. The clumsy and conspicuous use of special effects shatters the illusion, reminding the viewer that he is watching a film. The deputy sheriff's lack of interest in investigating the theft of $40 000 beggars belief.The virtually unrivalled excellence of the bulk of the film, reaching its apogee during the shower scene, transcends any residual imperfections. Psycho, through its elevation of the horror genre and its inspiration of subsequent generations of filmmakers and film enthusiasts, is surely deserving of its place in the canon of American cinema.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Lock Them Bathroom Doors, Kids", "date": "2017-02-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3635793", "sentiment score": [0.0119, 0.0504, 0.1167, 0.5125, 0.3085]}, {"content": "Marion Crane works for an estate agent in Phoenix; one Friday afternoon a client pays $40,000 in cash for a property and her boss ask to take it for the bank as he doesn't want it in the office over the weekend.

Then, as it starts to rain, she leaves the main road and stops at a remote motel for the night. The motel is run by Norman Bates who tells her that he lives in the neighbouring house with his aged mother. He appears to be friendly as he offers to make her something for supper.

Starring Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, and Hitchcock's abandoned would-be star Vera Miles; Psycho explores a desperate woman's attempt to forge a life with her boyfriend, and a man driven by his relationship to his mother. Psycho is a wonderful case study into the psyche of human beings with vastly different outlooks and intentions for their lives. Hitchcock delved into the psychology of humanity in a way to make audiences pay attention all the while creating a complete masterpiece and the film most closely associated with the famed suspense director.On a December day in Arizona, the audience meets Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who has just spent an extended lunch hour with her boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin). Sam is divorced and lives far from Marion so the only time they have together is stolen lunch hours and hotel rooms. Sam is reluctant to further his relationship with Marion, despite the intense love shared between the two, because he pays a monthly alimony to his divorc\u00e9e wife. Marion has a deep conversation with Sam in regards to the future of their relationship, as she wishes to become a married woman and create a home for Sam. Leaving the hotel room feeling helpless, a little desperate, and enslaved by her love of Sam so much so that she knows herself to be unable to leave him. Upon returning to her office, Marion's boss brings in a client flashing around $40,000 in cash for a transaction. Marion, being the one trusted to take the large sum of cash to the bank, instantly devises a plot in which she and Sam can enjoy a life together, married, together, and happy, if she can get away with the $40,000. Instead of going to the bank, Marion scurries home to pack a bag and embark on a new life. After speeding away on her new mission, Marion's boss passes her on the street initiating a guilt trip that Marion can't escape. After taking a nap on the side of the road, Marion has an interaction with a police officer which puts her even more on edge. Marion, convinced she must trade in her car for a new one after seeing her boss on the street, hastily makes a deal with the dealership o\\owner and speeds away hoping to avoid suspicion. After an especially rainy night, Marion has become unsure of her location and pulls into a secluded motel. Emerging from her car for shelter for the night, Marion meets motel owner Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a seemingly nice young man who helps Marion inside with her bags and offers to make her dinner so she doesn't have to go back out into the rain. After hearing a heated exchange between Norman and his mother, Marion offers advice and consolation for Norman, believing his mother to be an overbearing negative presence on his life. Norman is clearly taken aback by what he perceives to be an attack against his mother, Marion is taken aback by his strong reaction and seeks refuge to her room as she has already begun questioning her plan and seems to have decided to go back to Tuscon, return the money, and make amends with her boss. Little does Marion know, Norman and his relationship to his mother would interfere with her plans.Psycho has reached the point that there is little left to say about this film. It's a near perfect entry on Hitchcock's filmography. Psycho is so closely associated with the famed director that it has been endlessly analyzed and heralded for the masterwork that it is. The standout from the film, other than the brilliant direction of a largely dialogue-driven plot, is the fantastic score. Bernard Herrmann, a frequent collaborator with Hitchcock, crafts a perfect horror/suspense score that is as iconically connected to the film as the John Williams score is to Jaws. Granted, I haven't seen much of Anthony Perkins' work, but he was perfectly cast in the role of Norman Bates. Norman had to embody a psychotic crazed maniac inside a quiet, unassuming petulant child all at once, and Perkins was perfect for the extreme marriage of characterization. Martin Balsam is a brilliant character actor and it's always fun to see him pop up in a film. As earlier stated, Psycho is a surprisingly dialogue- driven film, with only a few shots of action sparsed throughout the film. The pivotal scene in which Marion and Norman share dinner together, bringing Marion back to her good- natured self, was filmed in such a perfect way highlighting the taxidermied shells on the wall exposing the possibility that Norman could be a much more sinister character than he initially appears. Hitchcock proves his strength as a suspense director with his seminal classic, Psycho. Near-perfect direction, incredible casting, and a brilliant score, it is clear to see why Psycho has stood the test of time, and remains a favorite and yearly Halloween viewing tradition, for myself anyway.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Psycho", "date": "2016-11-07T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3576422", "sentiment score": [0.0201, 0.1065, 0.4941, 0.3439, 0.0355]}, {"content": "Alfred Hitchcock has referred to this as a comedy.

Those \"slasher\" films as they're often called set the stage for later horror flicks the likes of \"Scream\" and \"I Know What You Did Last Summer\", along with a slew of other more modern horror films that follow in the legacy of movies with very intense villains.The first time I saw \"Psycho\" was around five years ago, and I had heard that it was the prototype of all of the above modern horror movies that I'd grown to love from my adolescence. I was quite let down, as this film is far from a Freddie, Jason, or Michael type of movie. Instead, this film is a \"horror\" film of a different time and era--the era in which Alfred Hitchcock was synonymous with the genre. And, inasmuch as that's true, \"Psycho\" has an altogether different feel than any of the post-\"Exorcist\" or post-\"Halloween\" horror films which have come to be more popular nowadays. Another way of putting it might be that this movie may rightly be considered a \"horror\" movie, but it's not really a \"scary\" movie by today's standards. Creepy at points? Yes. Scary? No.That said, I gave this movie a second chance today at a screening at a local historic theater. This time I went into it expecting a Hitchcock movie rather than a modern horror film--and I was not let down. Expectation is everything when it comes to what you get out of a movie, and when before I went hoping for an introduction to a gruesome killer the likes of Michael Myers, I left feeling like I'd been ripped off. But when I watched this movie knowing what to expect--a film high on suspense, with a psychopath as the main villain, albeit one that is a bit cheesy by today's standards--I found myself thoroughly enjoying this movie.I don't think I'm alone in feeling that this film has lost its horrific element in light of modern horror story telling. At one of the most climactic parts of the film (not the well known shower scene, but rather the climax involving Mrs. Bates later on toward the end of the movie), everyone in the theater literally laughed out loud. Perhaps not robustly, but still--the audience's reaction to a scene that was meant to be grotesque was laughter. That's how cheesy parts of this film can be by 2016 standards.And yet, still, when you watch the film for what it is--a suspense filled Hitchcock movie which deals with concepts of ethics and karma, along with the story of a hermit turned psychopath, this is an extraordinary movie. Two of the things that I like most about the film are the great camera work and its score. The movie is in black and white, but its picture quality is sharp (I saw it in digital projection), and the cinematography is as good as any ever put on the silver screen. And that theme song! The violins rushing this way and that--definitely one of the movie's best attributes.All that said, I'm giving \"Psycho\" a score of 9/10 stars, which is much higher than I would have given it when I expected a more modern touch, and indeed much higher than I imagined myself giving the movie when I walked into the theater. Perhaps the only thing making this movie fall just short of a 10/10 is that there are a few little plot holes that seem somewhat obvious if you think things through for a moment--but I won't go into those as it would require spoiling some things. The point is that this is a great movie, so long as you know what kind of vibe to expect.

Made with his TV crew, on a small budget and shot in black and white, the film shares more characteristics with noir and pulp than it does with his grand suspense pieces. In saying that, the film still delivers everything you would expect it to and more. It contains some of the most iconic imagery, characters and shocks ever put on screen. Being more terrifying than it had any right to be. It's Hitchcock holding the audience in the palm of his hand. And now it feels as if every important aspect of the film has become a big part of pop culture. The best word to describe the film is unnerving. From the moment the plot is set in motion the sense of dread never lets up. Said plot involves Marion Crane, a secretary who steals $40,000 from a slimy customer and leaves town. We get some insight into her actions, mainly her lover Sam having to pay his ex-wife alimony and their inability to marry as a result. It's a classic Hitchcock theme of a normal person caught up in crime. Marion isn't a bad person, just one forced to do something morally wrong which she later regrets. She stops off at the deserted Bates Motel and seems to get along with the quirky but seemingly pleasant owner Norman, which includes a fascinating dialogue scene in his parlour. However, the film turns on its head, as one event completely changes what we thought the film was initially about into something else entirely. Hitchcock's idea to kill off the leading lady barely halfway through proved to be a brave and ultimately inspired decision. It's a genius choice because it keeps the tension raised throughout. We know that if a main character can be axed off then surely nobody is safe. It is this thought process that provides the suspenseful moments with an added punch that makes them memorable and even more unsettling. They keep us constantly checking over each frame, afraid that anything might leap from the shadows and strike a killer blow. Playing with the audience's uncertainty and understanding just how powerful the feeling of unease can be. Bernard Herrmann's chilling, pulsating score weaves in and out of these scenes, adding even more layers of tension. Despite becoming famous for its sudden violence and shocks, the film has only a few moments that rely on startling the audience. Yet because these moments aren't overused they retain the fear factor. You see very little blood or wounds or gore that is usually associated with the genre. Most of the scares come from the imagery used and the way tension is built. A good example being the highway policeman who seemingly stalks Marion, with dark sunglasses leaving his face expressionless. The scene at the car dealership is truly frightening, the way in which he simply stares at her from across the street. It's pretty amazing how so much discomfort can be built from not only something so simple but someone who is meant to be a figure of good. He represents Marion's last chance to confess her crime, which would have ultimately saved her life. It shows how much we're invested in Marion's dilemma that we are terrified of her being caught.What always amazes me is just how well paced and executed the whole film is. There are long passages with minimal dialogue or plot development, where events play themselves out slowly and cautiously. And they remain effortlessly gripping throughout. A good example is Norman disposing of the body. Who'd of thought that a ten minute long sequence of cleaning up a murder scene could be so riveting? The film is deliberately sparse in that sense. A lot of time is devoted to building up the atmosphere and tension, giving us a feel of the characters and the environment that everything is taking place in. However, the dialogue heavy moments are just as engrossing. Any time Bates opens his mouth you can guarantee that something interesting will come out. The tense scene of him being grilled by detective Arbogast is a good example of that.You have Hitchcock's typical blondes in Janet Leigh as the reserved Marion and Vera Miles as her more inquisitive sister, both elegant and enjoyable to watch. But the truly fascinating character is definitely Norman Bates. What a wonderfully deranged individual. A man who appears to be controlled by his mother. You can tell instantly that something is not right with him. His quirky demeanour hides something disturbed lurking below. A great deal of that is down to Anthony Perkins superb performance. The things he captures complete the character, the way he moves, stammers, smiles, defends his mother, it's all perfectly done. This film very much becomes Norman's story, his actions are what keeps the plot moving forward. He ultimately becomes the character that everyone remembers.So what ends up making Psycho so memorable? I personally think it is down to how competently made and detailed it is. Hitchcock did something that many films of its ilk miss out on completely, he made the story, characters and scares all hold equal importance. The story is weaved perfectly, which in turn makes us feel something for the characters, and leads to the horror being so much more impactful. It is also the ultimate example of why atmosphere and tension will always beat gore and shock value on the scare scale. This is Hitchcock at the peak of his powers, working with a crew and cast that excel in every area and adding his own faultless direction to the mix. As a result it remains as powerful, gripping and terrifying as it has ever been.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Triumph of Fear", "date": "2016-07-16T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3505690", "sentiment score": [0.025, 0.1105, 0.1658, 0.43, 0.2687]}, {"content": "I watch this film in Professor Fitzsimons' class.

However, I was enough scared by the background music. It works very well to cause a lot of tension and to fill my heart with fear. This film is old, but I have heard it (maybe on \"Finding Nemo\" by Pixar). I think the background music is so famous that it is used for other movie or TV programme, also great and important for the film. Finally, please let me say this. I like Hitchcock's skills in expression. In the first half, he places taxidermy naturally and in the end, he expresses someone like taxidermy.

Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, this film, considered by many his \"magnum opus\", has a screenplay by Joseph Stefano and a cast led by Anthony Perkins and Vera Miles.I don't consider this film a horror movie, although its considered as such by most of people. It doesn't scare me, but let me uncomfortable, holding me to the screen. And I think that's what Hitchcock wanted to achieve. He was the master of suspense and knew how to hold the public, causing shivers of discomfort without putting the audience screaming in fear. The plot is brilliant, but the beginning doesn't show it, is intentionally unattractive in an effort to bring the public completely at ease... until Norman comes in. Norman Bates is one of the most psychologically complex characters I've ever seen, and was developed to the extreme by the director and the artist who gave him life. It looks like a nice guy, who even flirts with the attractive woman he just met. The bathroom scene is perhaps one of the most famous in the film (I read somewhere that liquid chocolate was used to give the color that Hitchcock intended for the blood in the tub), and the incidental soundtrack used in that scene has become an icon for itself. But the end of the film is even better, with an absolutely staggering climax that makes all the audience feel that it was worth seeing the movie (even if you already know the whole story). The photograph, in black and white, makes a decisive contribution to increasing tension in the audience, and I am sure that this was a conscious and deliberate choice of Hitchcock to achieve that, showing again the great quality and talent of this director.Nominated for four Academy Awards for Best Art Direction in Film Black and White, Best Cinematography in Black and White, Best Direction and Best Supporting Actress, this film didn't win any of them, which shows us that, sometimes, the Academy also makes mistakes. But \"Psycho\" doesn't need an Oscar to be a tremendous success.

It would seem that \"Psychosis\" was to suffer the fate of some outstanding paintings pilfered, that is, on HR and even angles. The halo of glory around masterpieces often makes overly picky to determine their real incorruptibility. But \"Psychosis\" still draws from the first seconds, holds incredible tension and scares to shiver. Alfred Hitchcock was sensitive to the internal mechanism of the creation of fear and like an experienced psychiatrist, he knew of a secret nerve endings, touching whom are able to bring a state of uncontrolled psychosis, a genuine nightmare. Unlike many imitators, the \"master of fear knew that fear breeds deep within us and not outside. The Director forces us to be afraid primarily of their own assumptions, conjecture, foreboding, happening fancy, just designing myself a terrible starting situation. The viewer inevitably identifies himself with a young Secretary Marion crane, caught by night in a secluded Motel.

He is the prototype for the making of suspense thrillers, an exemplar of genius filmmaking, and the innovator of true terror. Hitchcock changed film forever when he released his box office record breaking phenomena Psycho. With an explosive cast starring Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles and Janet Leigh, Psycho is a work of cinematic art. Said to have been the very first slasher film Psycho had both a cinematic and a social influence. Hitchcock opens the film with what many believe to be one of the best opening credit sequences of all time. He splits the words as they come across the screen alluding to what we are going to find out later about Mr. Bates. The story starts with us meeting Marion Crane (played by the beautiful Vera Miles). Hitchcock portrays Marion in a way that regardless of the crime she may be committing the audience cannot help but to root for her. Even though we watch her commit this crime Hitchcock paints it in a way that we do feel like she is justified. She steals the money from a man that does not appear to deserve it and her motive for taking the money is love. Hitchcock even alludes that she was going to return the money but she is murdered before she has the chance to. Which is why the stabbing in the shower scene is so horrifying and to this day seen as one of the most influential scenes in film history. Audiences during this time were not used to their protagonist dying suddenly. This scene was influential in the sense that it influenced society the same way films like Jaws and The Blair Witch Project did. The shower scene made something that normally would not be associated as scary terrifying. After Psycho's release people were afraid to shower showing the influence Hitchcock had even outside the theater. Anthony Perkins gives a stunning performance of Norman Bates, a severely troubled man who appears to live alone with his mother. After our protagonist is murdered, the audience has no choice but to sympathize and find a new one. This is so meticulously done by Hitchcock it is barley even noticed. We start to root for Norman because we do not yet know he is the murderer but associate him as a dedicated son. We watch him cover up the countless number of startling murders his mother commits until we find out that he is actually playing the role of his mother in one of the biggest plot twists of all time.

Janet Leigh's controlled performance is so convincing we feel every nerve-wracking moment after that first excruciating misdeed. From the opening scene over the skyline of Phoenix into the hotel room of Marion and Sam, I was drawn into the movie in a way that only a great movie can achieve. Audiences often complain that a movie can seldom measure up to a good book; however, a great movie can do visual tricks and show nuances very effectively in the hands of a great director. This movie is a case in point. The camera zooms into an envelope holding $40,000 or a peephole where Anthony Perkins, as Norman Bates, observes Marion undressing. The music is like chalk on a blackboard as the sharp violin strings heighten the nauseating fear that we feel along with Marion. The closeup of the police officer in sunglasses is almost terrifying. The pounding of the rain on the windshield is something almost everyone can feel and in this case, it seems like the world is crowding in on Marion. Scene by scene we go from one vignette to another. Vera Miles, as Marion's sister, and John Gavin, as Marion's lover, give brilliant performances as they try to get to the truth of Marion's disappearance. The supporting cast is outstanding, particularly Martin Balsam as Abrogast, the private eye. Anthony Perkins gives his career defining role, although he had many great roles. This was the only Hitchcock role for Leigh and Petkins and they made these characters their own. Highly recommend because it shows the great potential of film/making.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Psycho Superb!", "date": "2016-04-21T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3455719", "sentiment score": [0.0022, 0.0056, 0.0252, 0.4586, 0.5085]}, {"content": "Anyone can see that villains have become the 'New Heroes' in today's cinema.

Pedalino tells us that the filmmakers are playing more towards the real life scenarios. While watching the hero defeat the villain is satisfying it is not real life, and people soon forget their feelings towards the film.

It is Hitchcock's greatest use of montage - each cut as an assault on the audience's senses, each as another slash of the knife to Crane's dripping, screaming face. Eisenstein's theory means we do not actually see knife ever puncture flesh, but the separate images creates a merged meaning. And would it be half as iconic without Bernard Herrmann's contribution? The screeching strings are built up apprehensively before the pivotal scene, and when they finally match up with the knife, it slips in seamlessly with each slash, each cut, and it is frantic, horrifying. Hitchcock made history by killing her sensuous lead star less than halfway into his movie, but his mastery is shown in how effortlessly he moves our sympathies from the blonde to Norman Bates (actually they are not so different; compare the last, wicked smile with the furrow of the brow and the sneaking grin of Leigh in the exchanged car, as night's darkness descends on her but the light illuminates her face all the same - and those mischievous eyebrows!). We are continually shown the cop in the distance, a latent anxiety that makes the car swap all for naught. And we expect this to pan out somehow. This anxiety becomes Norman's as he discovers the murder - quickly, briefly, absentmindedly, as if he was just changing the sheets, he cleans up the mess. He puts on his boyish, gangly persona back on, and we pause as he does, hoping too the car will resume bubbling and sinking. And as his social facade is shaken by probing questions, we rally for him to regain his confidence and wish the detective away. Perkins is at the film's centre, with a brilliant, brilliant performance. With each rewatch it becomes a game to note his marked switches of his persona, his adoption of the psychopath's empty chuckle and stare. The social skills breakdowns are subtle; just a tiny pause, an awkward question, but not enough to make Crane too apprehensive. His wary eyes darting around just ever so slightly. His 'hobby' of taxidermy treads on the line between normal and deranged, but it is not until later do we recognise the sexual motif of the birds (his mother being his first stuffed corpse) and the way Perkin's body language uncannily points towards his internal psychological delusion. As if we did not receive the message clearly, Hitchcock superimposes a skull onto that final, chilling stare. Hitchcock also went to great lengths to hide his mystery whilst not compromising his visuals. The shadow behind the shower curtain and illuminating only the feminine wig. The bird's eye view of Arbogast's demise, complete with rear projection effect so it feels like he is falling into the stairs (not dissimilar to Hitchcock's own dolly zoom). The female silhouette high up in the Bates second-story window (it is not so far-fetched to imagine Norman propping up his late mother and having conversations with her). In one instance, the lazy-eye of the sheriff seems to address the audience itself and ask: \"Who then is that woman buried in the Bates grave?\" I have come to accept the final psychiatrist's explanation as a necessary evil; it was a different time, as evident by Hitchcock's promos which forbid late entrants to theatre showings. Would a modern viewer ever entertain the idea of walking in halfway through a film only to realise the star had already been killed off? But Hitchcock set a precedent; no doubt viewers were all thoroughly confused to find Leigh bubbling under the swamp, but it only piqued their curiosity, their determination to unravel the mystery of Psycho.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "We all go a little mad sometimes.

What can I say that hasn't already been said about this film? I could tell you that Janet Leigh only ever took baths after watching the famous shower scene played out on a big screen and realising how vulnerable women in showers were. I could tell you that liquid chocolate was used for blood to make it look more authentic in black and white in the film. I could tell you that Hitchcock decided to film in black and white on purpose because he wanted to keep the costs down and also because he was fed up with the star studded glossy films of the time. I could even tell you that Bernard Herrmann's musical score inspired Hitchcock to double the fee Herrmann was receiving, especially after seeing and hearing the shower scene which Hitchcock had originally intended to be silent. This film has been talked about, written about, studied and idolised to death - but deservedly so, so lets not look at trivia and facts and progress with this review. Psycho is a departure from the standard horror movies of the time which generally had physical monsters in them. This film looked more at the human psyche and how much of a horror your average Joe Anybody could be - and believe me Anthony Perkins does a fine job on delivering that. The film helped to break a lot of stereotypes which Hollywood had in place and with it's perfectly emotional delivery the films is an absolute master-class on how to make something out of seemingly very little.This is arguably Hitchcock's finest film and plays on many emotions through sight, sound and feel. An amazing cast of stars bring the characters to life, the setting is authentic and feels right and the musical score (Bernard Herrmann) is just as famous as the film itself, both rely heavily on each other to deliver perfection but it could equally be said that they would be brilliant standing alone too. Although I wasn't around during the 60's and 70's I have been led to believe that this film is as authentic as it comes for summing up the era and this is absolutely down to Hitchcock vision. If you sit down having not seen this before you could mistakenly think this is a robbery/heist based film with the leading lady, Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) on the run from her employer for stealing $40k. Although stealing is bad Marion being the central lead assumes the role of heroine and the audience are almost encouraged to root for her. As it turns out the money is not that important and soon takes a back seat to the plot - albeit the other characters looking for Marion are motivated in part by the desire to find the money and clear or validate the accusation Marion is facing. Up until arriving at the Bates motel you are only fed snippets of information about Marion, any time you get close to discovering more about her via the other characters, they are soon met with a dead end. Norman Bates (Perkins) seems to manage to delve the deepest into Marion but what he finds out isn't happy news to his mothers ears. I'm not going to delve too much into the plot of the rest of the film in case you haven't seen it - the last thing I wasn't to do is spoil the ending (if you are one of a few people who haven't actually seen this). What I will say is watch this and enjoy, it's a good old fashioned horror film which has embedded itself in pop culture and the halls of film legend due to it's depth, charm and it's absolute quality.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "An absolute master-class in film", "date": "2016-04-05T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3446041", "sentiment score": [0.044, 0.0755, 0.0948, 0.3116, 0.4741]}, {"content": "Alfred Hitchcock was the master of making films full of suspense and horror.

Similar to Robert Wise's film The Haunting, Hitchcock is able to use the audience's imagination against them. Just like the fact that no ghosts are visible in The Haunting, Psycho does not actually show violence. Instead, it is implied and more terrifying that way. Hitchcock's use of sound in this movie makes it more suspenseful as well. Particular creepy is the sharp violin music that plays just before a character is brutally murdered. Hitchcock also uses foreshadowing to create added levels of suspense throughout the film.Janet Leigh plays Marion Crane in the film. She steals $40,000 from her employer in an attempt to get away from the daily stresses of life with actor John Gavin who plays character Sam Loomis. Marion flees Phoenix to join Sam in Fairvale, but the journey is long and Marion is forced to stop for the night. Fearing that she will be caught, Marion chooses to stay at a run-down hotel that is off the beaten track. It is at this hotel where Marion meets Norman Bates who is played by Anthony Perkins. Unknown to Marion, Norman is a violent psychopath who develops an alter ego as his mother. Unable to control himself, Norman eventually stabs Marion to death, puts her body in the truck of her car, and pushes her car into a muddy pond on the property to dispose of the evidence.After Marion's mysterious disappearance, her sister Lila who played by Vera Miles, goes in search of her at Sam's place of employment in Fairvale. Actor Martin Balsam plays Private Detective Arbogast who is hired to track down Marion and the missing money. Arbogast assumes that Marion went to see Sam, so he questions Sam and Lila about her whereabouts. With no leads to go on, Arbogast tries to retrace what would most likely have been Marion's trip from Phoenix to Fairvale. It is during his investigation that Arbogast stops at the Bates Motel and talks to Norman. Norman eventually admits that Marion was at his hotel, but claims that she left. Unconvinced, Arbogast alerts Sam and Lila that he has found a trail and that he is going back to try and talk to Norman's mother.In order to know what will come of the investigation, one will have to watch the film.

Psycho is a classic horror film that challenges the genre for a contemporary audience, a rush of chaotic fear and madness as suspenseful as you would have predicted from the movie that started the slasher genre itself. Despite a slower pace and dated special effects, it's a well crafted if unconventional horror film. Along with it's creativity, it has a more engaging plot filled with more visual disturbing than almost any other film in the horror genre.Hitchcock does this by building a connection to his audience to the characters. By getting into the main character, Marion Crane's (Janet Leigh) mind at an early start of the film, has you not only engaged but intensively worried already of what will happen to her. Being a secretary in Phoenix, Marion's conscience drives her insane when she decides to steal 40,000 dollars from a client in order to run away with her love, Sam Loomis (John Gavin). With an eerie feel, you are sucked into the movie trying to figure out how and why things are happening to her. The buildup adds to the intensity of the unknown of who is the killer and why their motives are the way that they are.As Marion Crane tries to run farther away from her problems, not only has she found herself in a huge rainstorm but also exhausted from the endless thoughts of her conscience mind. Having to pull over she is luckily able to find the flickering lights of the Bates Motel to stay the night. There she meets the polite, man of few words, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Norman welcomes Marion to her stay by casual talk over sandwiches and milk. Norman then explains his interest in taxidermy and his unique relationship with his mother. Hitchcock sets the scene of this encounter by his ability of using foreshadowing with little details of Norman's parlor where the scene takes place. It is there where we find out more about his overbearing, domineering mother. Throughout the entire film, viewers have a sense of suspense always being displayed whether it is through the mysterious music, the director's use of certain angles, or even just the unknown of what we as the audience understand. Hitchcock finds a way of having you always questioning and in a way, overwhelmed with emotions while watching his films. Viewers that are from my generation could say that to be even considered a \"horror\" film or even a \"thriller\" there must be a certain amount of violence or gore to reach this criteria.However, in 1960, horrified viewers saw Psycho as such a thrilling film and to be surprisingly not explicitly violent which our generation today would be uncommonly found in the latest horror, thriller films. Hitchcock doesn't use the violent gestures to make his film what it is. It is about the psychological intellect that he so deliberately has the audience feel. It is about the buildup and the mysterious overall mood of his masterpiece that has you leaving wanting more.If the definition of a good thriller to you is gore and violence, Psycho wouldn't necessarily be the movie for you. Not meaning to say that there isn't a scene or two that will take you by surprise, but there is so much more than the gruesome feel to this movie. It is Hitchcock's way of giving his audience enough suspense, curiosity, and most of all, that thrilling feel that makes the must see Psycho what it is, a worldwide phenomenon.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Psycho by Alfred Hitchcock is a must see", "date": "2015-12-04T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3366374", "sentiment score": [0.0037, 0.0391, 0.3629, 0.5471, 0.0472]}, {"content": "Alfred Hitchcock has done it again.

Chosen to be shot in black-and-white rather than color, the tone is often terrifying, and the acting is chilling as well. The film is loaded with symbolism, and terrific composition that is just subtle enough to not give away the plot, but tells an educated audience member everything they need to know from a single frame.Psycho benefits from masterful direction from Alfred Hitchcock, who embodies what is considered perfect mise en scene, by making almost every object in frame important in some way. The composition of the film is extremely dense, whether it be symbolic, or narratively relevant, almost every frame is crucial for the film. A great example of this is the parlor scene, in which we see Norman Bates invite Marion into his parlor. One could argue the plot of the rest of the film is told through symbolism, and composition. In the scene the composition very heavily foreshadows the coming events of the film, as we see predatory birds and predatory sexualized paintings in the parlor, concurrent with Norman. As the audience sees a large Owl, in attacking position, on eye level with Norman, the meaning is clear. This composition is consistently used throughout the scene. Another example is Marion is usually in camera with ravens, very clearly foreshadowing her fate. It's this dense and brilliant composition that makes Psycho a great example of Alfred Hitchcock's genius. Another thing that is evident throughout the film is Hitchcock's style, whether it be his obsession with birds, his love of particular shots, or his undeniable voyeuristic use of the camera. Composition is the director's most direct route into the mind of the audience, if one knows what to look for they can learn about a director from his composition. What we see is Hitchcock likes shots that feel as if the audience is looking at the characters through something, whether it be a windshield, window, or hole in the wall. Using these shots Hitchcock almost makes the camera feel like another person viewing the film. It's the use of voyeuristic shots, and the attempt to make the camera feel like another character that subtly brings the audience to Norman Bate's level, at one point we even see shots from his perspective. I suspect this was done to muddle the message of who is right, and who is wrong, because the audience is both off put with the creepiness of Norman, but is also lead to be sympathetic. In essence Hitchcock makes a movie where we see no truly good characters, but no truly bad characters either. In the end Hitchcock created a masterful horror film that could still stand as one of the best all time. The black-and-white color, dense composition, and uneasy score make Psycho all the more terrifying.

If you don't already know what this movie is about then you really need to stop reading this right now and go watch the movie. I've seen this movie dozens of times over the years from VHS to DVD to Blu- ray and I've seen it at least five times on the big screen and for my money this is Alfredy Hitchcock's greatest film and one of the greatest ever made. I know VERTIGO, a brilliant movie, gets all the love and respect but for my money this here is his greatest film.Where do you start with a movie like this? Everyone knows that the budget was slashed on the director and it certainly helped the film because had this been in color or had it been lavished with a big budget then it just wouldn't have the same feel. The movie has some of the most historic moments in film history that everyone knows about. These moments are of course the shower sequence as well as the ending. Both certainly deserve to be mentioned whenever you discuss brilliant scenes but for my money the greatest sequence in the movie is what happens before the shower sequence and it's the discussion between Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) as they discuss what is basically holding them back.The performances between the two actors are just so flawless and this scene is so important because it tells us everything we need to know going into the second half of the movie, which is pretty much after the shower scene. The first portion of the movie we're worried and caring about the Crane character but we get the shock of what happens and then our sympathy immediately turns to Norman and him helping his mother. The way Hitchcock pulls this off is rather remarkable but the shocks keep happening with one terrific twist after another leading up to the ending.What's always amazed me about this movie is how your initial viewing is nothing but pure shocks and gasps but then on repeat viewings, even when you know all the secrets, you can enjoy it just as much because you can then enjoy the film by watching a master handle the material. You can watch for the clues and see all the winks that Hitchcock is giving the viewer. No matter how many times I watch this film I can simply sit back and enjoy it on so many levels. It's a movie where you brain knows what's going on but the film is just so great that you can enjoy everything and wish that the character's fate changes somehow.Everything from the performances to the score to the cinematography are flawless.

PSYCHO has been around for over 50 years, and if you haven't seen it by now it's your own fault. Of course, it's been several years since I first saw it and, going through a Hitchcock marathon, I thought it would be an appropriate time to revisit it. My only memories of seeing it the first time are wondering what the big deal was. However, now having seen many films since then (including several more Hitchcock pictures), it seems even better to me the second time around. This is in large part thanks to the Bernard Herrmann's score, which punctuates all the right moments and backs off when necessary. The first thing other than the main theme that people will probably think of is the celebrated shower scene, but this time the moments where the score takes a back seat, or goes away entirely, stood out more. In particular, the scene where Norman and Marion have dinner in his parlor came off as extremely creepy, and the way in which Norman's demeanor changes within that scene was nothing short of amazing. Also, in contrast to NORTH BY NORTHWEST, PSYCHO has a rear-projected driving scene which actually worked for me. Again, a lot of this has to do with the score, but Janet Leigh's facial expressions and reactions to what goes on around her helped just as much to make it work. What also makes this film stand out from a lot of Hitchcock's other pictures was the conscious artistic choice to shoot in black and white. Although he said it would have been too gory to shoot in color, it gives the film a distinct griminess that stands in contrast to the high glamour of his other work. PSYCHO is decidedly unglamorous, and it succeeds because it fits with the subject matter. Lastly, Hitchcock is notorious for playing with audience expectations, and PSYCHO contains perhaps his greatest cinematic joke: the (apparent heroine) is killed off nearly halfway in to the film. Now her death does provide the dramatic momentum for the rest of it, but I can only imagine how audiences 1960 would have been shocked by this twist. In terms of his overall corpus (at least what I've seen so far), I'd put it up there with REAR WINDOW and NORTH BY NORTHWEST just shy of VERTIGO. The only thing that brings it down a peg is some needless psychoanalysis in the last scene. For me, it would have been more powerful to cut most of that out and skip to the chilling final shot that gradually zooms in on Anthony Perkins' face. Still, even with that scene, PSYCHO is definitely one of Hitchcock's finest, and laid the groundwork for the next generation of horror films.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "\"A boy's best friend is his mother.\"", "date": "2015-08-11T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3295334", "sentiment score": [0.04, 0.192, 0.3508, 0.3443, 0.0729]}, {"content": "I suppose it's quite peculiar that I only saw 'Psycho' after seeing around a dozen other Hitchcock titles, given that it's his best- known film. As I pressed 'play', I made the mistake of assuming that it'd just be a seminal slasher film, lacking the complexity of other Hitchcock titles such as 'Rebecca' and 'Vertigo'. I'm glad to say that I was wrong. The score was perfect, and I'm not just talking about the piercing shrieks of the legendary shower scene. It remains amongst the most iconic in cinema, and is just as foreboding as John Williams' score for 'Jaws'. Another winning feature of Hitchcock's horror is the excellent acting. I hadn't heard much about Anthony Perkins prior to watching 'Psycho', and so I was sceptical as to how he could portray a villain as iconic as Hannibal Lecter and Darth Vader. His acting talents shine from the first scene in which he appears, though, and Perkins delivers a truly outstanding performance as the crazed motel manager, Norman Bates. The performances of Janet Leigh, Vera Miles and the other actors in 'Psycho' are just as good as Perkins'. The twists and plot developments delivered in the film are similarly brilliant. After the shower scene, I wasn't sure that the film could surprise me or really offer me much, but I was \u2013 once again \u2013 surprised. The level of danger perceived in 'Psycho' is much greater than that in many other Hitchcock titles, and I never thought that a 55-year-old film could grip me like this did. The brilliant director's other titles were certainly thrilling, but the threats facing actors such as James Stewart, Joan Fontaine and Tippi Hedren seemed either relatively minor ('Rear Window'; 'Rebecca'), more intriguing than dangerous ('Vertigo'; 'Suspicion'), or even comical ('The Birds'). 'Psycho' could not be dismissed in this manner, and I found the plight of Vera Miles and Janet Leigh just as intense as Jodie Foster's in 'The Silence of the Lambs', if not more so. At points, Alfred Hitchcock's iconic horror was creepier than 'Rosemary's Baby' and more shocking than 'The Exorcist', and the director accomplishes this without delving into the supernatural or paranormal. I'd go so far as to say that this title is one of the greatest films ever produced, and it certainly ranks as my favourite Hitchcock title at the moment.

Psycho is undoubtedly one of the greatest films of all time! Director Alfred Hitchcock really hit it home with this one. Psycho is about a woman named Marion who steals $40,000 and drives out to Fairville California with the intention of giving the money to her boyfriend Sam. On the way to Fairville, she stops at a motel called the Bates Motel, where she intended to spend the night before finishing her drive. The Bates Motel is run by a young man named Norman Bates who seems harmless, but stutters a lot in his speech. Marion is murdered that night in the motel. A few days later, she (obviously) has not been seen since she left for Fairville, a detective named Arbogast, Marion's sister Lila, and Sam go to look for her, and well, I won't spoil the rest. This film is not scary in terms of jump scares and violence, seeing as there is a very low body count, but it is scary because of the fact that things like these actually happen and you could be a victim of murder. The first half of the film is where the film shines, with fantastic acting and it builds up to the final standoff. The final 20 minutes are typical, clich\u00e9 moments that we've all seen in thrillers, but Psycho is able to do it without being boring or repetitive.

I expected what the DVD case said: a thriller. What I got was not much in return. The story follows Marion Something who decides to rob her perfectly nice boss and go on the run with the money. Why? Doesn't matter. She is then pursued by a theorizing cop for a wholesome round of filler suspense. I wasn't embroiled in her life. I was bored. She then stops at a motel and after a long bout of small talk with the creepy care-taker, is murdered. I haven't marked this as a spoiler because it isn't one. It barely happens halfway through.I don't give a flying, enchanted sh!t about shocking the audience if it removes the stupid main character from the stupid movie. The rest of the movie is a detective (about whom I saw no reason to care) looking into Marion's disappearance and ultimately the wacky misadventures of Marion's sister and Marion's butt buddy Sam. THIS WEBSITE lists Marion as fourth in the cast and I'm expected to pay attention. I found myself disengaged from the story. I blame the screenplay. Upon closer inspection and after a second, forced viewing in film class, I saw that there was still three-act structure and an antagonist. There's even the first conflict between the protagonist and primary opposition at the middle as Dan Decker states in Anatomy of a Screenplay. I was still not interested and a movie can be uninteresting if it follows some of the rules. Ask yourself this: how much is actually known about Marion, Lila, or Sam?Psycho was expertly directed, shot, and edited. The shower scene lived up to its expectations.

Hitchcock is known for Movies with surprise endings while keeping you wondering what will happen next. This film is a must see for everyone, even those who do not like horror movies.The movie is about a woman, Marion Crain (Janet Leigh)who seems to be a little on the naughty side, but honest. Marion is honest until the day she decides to steal $40,000 in cash from her employer. Marion leaves town by vehicle to be with her boyfriend who is penniless. Marion travels a long distance and starts to get tired and pulls into the Bates Motel. She has a surprise waiting for her there. The plot thickens from here. I will not go into plot detail for those of you who have not viewed the film, but the suspense is uncanny in the way Hitchcock directed the movie.Hitchcock uses music and lighting in a way that draws the audience's full attention and makes the viewers become a part of the film. The suspense in this film is beyond comprehension, in the way that a person has not lived until you have viewed this film. No film of this time has been able to top this suspenseful thriller. The fact that the movie is in black and white makes the film unusually dramatic. Viewers thought Notorious was good, but Psycho is even better. Hitchcock has plenty of surprises and keeps his audience guessing. The dramatic lighting, camera angles, and suspenseful music make Psycho one of his best.If you have seen the 1998 version of this film, it does not do Hitchcock's 1960's version justice. The camera angles and lighting are much better in the 1960 version and keep the audience in suspense throughout. The newer version has dead zones, and the suspense is broken up. The coloring in the later film does not give the audience the feeling of standing in the scene watching what is going on. The acting in the newer film is extremely poor and boring.The 1960's original screenplay, Psycho is almost guaranteed to make you hang onto your chair throughout the movie, even if you are viewing a movie on a cell phone.

My impression is that Psycho is perceived as purely a great piece of craft and entertainment, but in my mind what makes Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho such a singular work is the deep and personal poetry it contains.Hitchcock was completely fearless in his ideas at this point. He makes his most radical and innovative film. The movie is heightened from his famous thrillers to a pure and modern horror movie. The visual universe is now dirty and grim as opposed to beautiful and glamorized. The icy and sophisticated blonds are gone and there are no traces of sympathetic heroes. Everyone who has seen an interview with Alfred Hitchcock knows that he hides behind an inflated and parodic character. In his interviews he is very secretive and doesn't revel anything about himself. The opposite is true in his films. In his movies he is often completely open and naked. He exposes the most shameful truths about himself and his life. In Psycho he does a personal examination on a level beyond anything I've ever seen. He puts himself in the space where he is the most vulnerable. He offers a \"peeping hole\" into the darkest corners of his personality. The movie is extremely revealing, but in very subtle ways. One has to work to find the treasures of Psycho. Psycho is like a novel in the way images are often suggested and has to be completed in the heads of the audience. The sexual and violent scenes are never explicit. This makes the movie even more disturbing than it ever could be if we had seen the images, and this was also the only way Hitchcock could convey what he wanted to convey and still get past the ridiculously strict American censorship laws of the time.Sexuality is always a theme in a Hitchcock movie, but he never explored it as profoundly or intimately as he did in Psycho. The shower scene for example feels like a rape as much as it does a murder(the feeling intrusion, the nakedness and so on). Norman desperately desires Marion Crane. He is sexually satisfied by killing her(it might be a stretch, but I see the knife as a symbol of the male sex organ). This scene is all about the childish shame of Normans sexuality. Norman, or the mother side of him, tries to suppress his sexuality completely. This is one of the examples of the openness of Hitchcock in this movie. His catholic upbringing would suggest a lot of shameful sexuality in his life as well. Something he has in common with his biggest contemporary director hero, Luis Bunuel. Bunuel are one of very few directors who explored his own sexuality with anything close to the amount of honesty of Psycho.Psycho is such a rich movie. It is filled with details. I believe you could watch it fifty times over and still find something new the fifty first time you watch it. Pay for example attention to all the little symbols and metaphors scatterd all over every single frame. Notice all the fascinations or \"fetishes\" of Hitchcocks that he put into it. The stuffed birds and the way they mirror Normans mother. The way food and eating connects with murder and sex. The peeping hole as a symbol for voyeurism and the movie camera. The cellar as a symbol of the suppressed and the shameful truths about Norman Bates. I really want to go into all these details, but like I said, there are too many and too much to discuss. It wont fit into the format of an IMDb review... If you don't see the same things I do in this movie, please watch it again. Even more than the magnificent \"Vertigo\" Psycho has the ability to grow immensely on a second viewing, and continue to grow on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth... In my heart it has grown to be one of the absolute best films in movie history.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 6, "votes": 7}, "heading": "The Great Cinematic Poem", "date": "2014-11-22T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3128843", "sentiment score": [0.0271, 0.0675, 0.0918, 0.3927, 0.4208]}, {"content": "By far the greatest work of The Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. When I watched this film for the first time aged 16, I was sucked in by the plot, the characters, Bernard Herrmann's score and the terrific acting.

What can you say that hasn't already been said about the performance of Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates except that it's a tragedy he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. His delivering of the script, his shyness and sudden twists is one of the best acting performances I've witnessed. But that doesn't take away from the rest of the cast. Janet Leigh is wonderful as Marion Crane, and supporting talent from John Gavin, Martin Balsam and especially Vera Miles, make for a film you can watch over and over.This is the first film I ever saw where afterwards, I wanted to know everything there was to know about it. I watched all the making of documentaries I could find, I wanted to watch all the sequels (Psycho II is also very good by the way) and I even chose the film as my specialist subject in a quiz we did in my college.I recommend this film to everyone. It's full of twists, turns and surprises that keep you guessing right until the end, and I mean the very end. You can't take your eyes of the screen.

Despite being a horror movie, and having its fair share of genuinely frightening moments, Psycho has always struck me as being made to have a certain lighthearted charm. I have to imagine when Alfred Hitchcock made this film he was having fun and wanted the film to be as fun for us as it was for him. It's one of my favorite scary movies, but when I look back to it I don't think of it at all like I do the others on the list. This movie is just a good time.If Psycho was a person, and its fun, creepy atmosphere was its skin, and Anthony Perkins was its face I guess, Its structure would be a crazy adamantite skeleton and its pacing? Well, synthetic cyborg muscles of course. For a horror film to maintain the feeling it needs to keep its viewers attention in the events leading up to the scares, it needs to have a solid setup for the plot that goes on long enough for it to not feel rushed but not so overlong that it becomes boring and takes away from the impact of the scary moments it's building up to. It needs to be interesting enough to not feel like a chore, but still understand its role as a vehicle for the frightening moments in the films. The story takes a back seat to the scary stuff in a horror movie. The good ones understand this, but the best of them do it in a way that doesn't compromise the quality of the story. Psycho is a shining example of a balanced and well executed horror film narrative. It's the king of this technique. the events leading up to Marion Crane's trip to the Bates motel work exceptionally well, and her encounters with the police officers at the dealership and on the road do an amazing job of establishing the spooky feel of the film in a seamless way and work to keep the viewer interested in what's to come. The ease with which Hitchcock leads into the events that take place at the motel are a huge part of what allows him to make the film such a good time.You can't sing the praises of Psycho without applauding the incredible work Anthony Perkins does as the film's criminally insane leading man- the one and only Norman motherloving Bates. Perkins' ability to personify a person with such a severe case of dissociative identity disorder is so unbelievably good you'd think this guy went home at the end of the day and lived life as Norman Bates instead of himself. Not only does he have such an intrinsic ability to play the psycho, but he does such an impeccable job of committing Norman's crimes as well. When he sneaks up on the woman in the legendary and absolutely immortal shower scene, he does so like he was made to be a movie monster, and when he rushes in to attack the detective to the sound of Bernard Herrmann's screeching soundtrack he could scare a banana straight out of its goshdang peel. And bananas don't even have eyes or ears or even watch movies in the first place.I love this film. it's a champion of horror. In a genre where so many films can only be fun by sacrificing the scares or just by being low budget bargain bin Netflix dumpster movies, Psycho triumphs in its ability to conquer everything important to entertain horror fans. Alfred Hitchcock's talent is so palpable in this film it may just as well turn itself into a big spoonful of Bates flavored gelato and fly its way right into the brain mouths of everyone watching. Gelato only has half the calories of regular ice cream, too. You ever try it? It's like ice cream pudding. It's great.

Psychological horror tends to fade to gray.Well, despite all this, Hitchcock's the Suspense Master and Psycho is his best film. I'd like to compare to Agatha Christie's best story, the 6th most sold novel of all times, Ten Little N*****s aka And Then There Were None: there is something crude about both productions. TLN is not very elaborated in its language, rather straightforward. Yet, the background information about each victim is direct and convincing. The main plot is fantastic and the atmosphere the novel brings at least got me entangled in it.Now, Psycho on the other hand, has a less fantastic story: it could happen that a girl at large ends in a gloomy motel at the will of a mentally ill murderer. The similarity rather lies in the movie's lack of pretension, in stark contrast to say, Vertigo. Besides this comparison, it's noteworthy that Psychostarted of the slasher type flicks, complete with the eerie staccato musical score introduced and indulged in various new elements in film such as a toilet bowl close up is a two act movie: first act is about the female protagonist's stealing of money, the second is about the male protagonist's killing of her and his disturbed life lacks the typical Mac Guffin ingredient as the motivations for the protagonists are well introduced and of great importance to the plotdeals openly with sex topics as transvestism has a Christiesque the-detective-presents-the-crime-summing up in the final scene where the psychologist explains to the DA what has happened has a number of details from other movies, for instance, Norman Bates was not the innovative character it could have been since Orson Welles already invented the neurotic Motel Host in A Touch of Evil (1958) played by Dennis Weaver.

Alfred Hitchcock's often imitated, but never matched, Psycho.To start, the film has possibly one of the tightest screenplays ever written. Innumerable twists, plays on the audiences expectations and elegant little subversions upon itself make the plot come alive and dazzle like a firecracker. I mean it when I say that 54 years after its release the rest of the genre is still trying to catch-up Joseph Stefano and Robert Bloch's masterpiece of a screenplay. However, the way Hitchcock delivers this script is also incredible. Small visual hints and tricks make the film a joy to re-watch. For example, we see a woman in white underwear, later in the film she wears black underwear to show that she has committed an impure act. Such tiny details, but the impact is massive on the whole.Next the acting. Anthony Perkins delivers one of the most effective 'creepy' performances of all time. Like the screenplay it too has not been matched in 54 years and remains the yardstick for all psychopathic portrayals in film. Aside from Perkins however, the rest of the cast give strong performances, particularly Janet Leigh in the 'starring' role. The set design is legendary. Such mundane and simple locations are brought to life by the films exquisite lighting and use of shadows. The house in the background to the main set looms like a falcon, and casts a shadow over all the preceding events. You feel like someone is watching you at all times, and are constantly on edge. Such simple images as a stuffed bird, or a tall staircase are used so effectively here. This film remains an icon on minimalist set design, and how to creep your audience out with the simplest of imagery. Overall I cannot praise this film enough. One of the most iconic and brilliant films, from one of the most iconic and brilliant directors of all time.

One thing which has us felt realism is camera-work and sound effects. For example, Hitchcock connected a lot of short scenes without a break, which is called montage. It relieves tension of frightening and also a monochrome relieves it too. While Hitchcock removes scares a little, he leaves some fright points. Another thing is angles.

It suggests that the ordinary people we like or even feel sorry for are just as dangerous as the ones we instinctively fear. Norman Bates' twisted psyche ties together love, violence, and the Oedipal complex -- Hitchcock's favourite themes, perhaps never realized so well.I've always been something of a Hitchcock skeptic, and Psycho contains its share of the overcomplication and affectedness that often dogs his work. There's a lot of glut here -- the whole plot line of Marian stealing the money, the tedious investigation sequence after the first murder, and the clumsy exposition that puts everything in a neat little box at the end.

Norman seems normal when you first meet him on film, yet the more he speaks the more he seems strange, just weird when he talks - that alone is enough to scare the pants off of you! Then you factor in the fact he is in fact \"Psycho\" on top of it the movie becomes one of the all time scariest films ever!

Who then dresses up in his mother's clothes and ends up killing Marion in the most famous scene in the movie \"The Shower Scene\". Then a private investigator (played by Martin Balsam) and her sister (played by Vera Miles) search for her.

Norman lives alone with only his mother, a mentally disturbed woman. This simple story will progress into one of the most thrilling films of the twentieth century.

For one thing, it would not have lit the fuse to the explosion of other unique slasher villains that everyone comes to know and enjoy at the movies. As crazy as this idea was back in the day, Hitchcock was able to push the boundaries of suspense and create a legend that practically no one can forget. Thankfully everything here is put together in such a way that it amounts to a very clever, creepy and disturbing movie.The story is about a girl named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who is given a huge sum of money and is expected to deposit in the bank. However, she becomes greedy and decides to run off with it. While on her escape, she decides to rest at an old motel owned by a man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). There she learns that Norman is under the strict rule of his mother and that he's a slight bit unsettling. However, she doesn't realize how unsettling Norman really is. Co-starring Perkins and Leigh are several other veteran actors like Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam and John McIntire.The writing is based off of Robert Bloch's work of the same name. Bloch himself had based it off of the disturbing real story of Ed Gein of Plainfield Wisconsin in 1957. What's great though is that Hitchcock kept everything identical to the book. Every scene that is depicted gives momentum to the plot and helps make the tension that much more gripping. The best actor here is Anthony Perkins. Not only are his reactions real but also feel genuine. For example, when telling a lie and then being found out, he tries to cover his tracks. He is able to do so but speaks nervously. As for the year, 1960 had some graphic violence come into play. Not enough to shock anyone, but creative enough to let the audiences' imagination run wild. Also, just because the film is in black and white doesn't mean for any viewer who doesn't like the \"old\" films, can't be entertained either. With the simplicity of color, there are other things for the viewer to watch and notice. Having only black and white actually simplifies the viewing experience for the audience. Accompanying that is Bernard Herrmann's all string score, with one of the most iconic tunes taking place in a shower scene. If you want to know where slasher films began, it's here.Norman Bates is the original slasher villain.

Psycho builds upon his lavish traditions of suspense building, sly camera work, and jarring shocks delivering everything one wants from the great Auteur dabbling his toes in the waters of horror.The plot revolves around The Bates Motel in which the Freudian wet-dream of a proprietor, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) murders unsuspecting women out of some hazy, deep-seated love-hate relationship with his mother. Little more is really needed to form the set-up for an early example of what has come to be known as 'slasher flick'. Also, one doesn't want to give too much of the plot away while writing here as some (such as me until a few nights ago) have managed to avoid seeing this film so far.What I will talk about, however, is the fantastic camera-work that has gone into this film. Hitchcock makes expert use of his decision to produce this film in black and white (some claim he did it to reduce to the gore, others that he did it as a cost cutting measure) casting his demented antagonist in half shadows, highlighting his ambiguity of self and drawing the viewer into his dark, half-formed world of shadows and madness. The conversation scene between Bates and the beautiful Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), for example, is one of the most wonderfully awkward and subtly terrifying dialogue driven moments in the history of cinema, and, of course, no-one can forget the deftly handled and instantly recognisable shower scene.My issues with this film lie precisely and paradoxically in the things that make it so wonderful, however. I mean, Hitchcock's self-conscious and self-aware self-referentiality and toying with Truffaut's Auteur theories are wonderful as an exercise in film theory, but Psycho, at times, runs the risk of piling signature atop signature until it becomes somewhat a pastiche of Hitchcock's own style. The death of Marion so early in the piece, the bird motif, and the unbelieving policeman are all nice flourishes from a film-school perspective, but at the same time they come across as snide and self-important.Now, I won't criticise the man and his style too much, but I will say that Psycho is perhaps not the best example of Hitchcock's ability to weave high-art film-theory in with his genre fiction fantasies of murder and mayhem.Still though, Psycho is up there as one of the finest and earliest in the grand tradition of slasher horror, and as a genre film it really can't get enough kudos. Sharply directed, shot, and edited it keeps viewers on the edge of their seats thrilled to the max even a full fifty years after its initial release, and I imagine it will continue to be a favourite of many switched on film buffs for many, many years to come.

A contributor to this is his directing of one of America's most famous horror films, Psycho. Aside from being extremely captivating and an overall great film the movie has a lot of significance in terms of both historic significance and social significance. For film history Psycho was one of the first and most iconic films to really push the envelope on what the current rating system, studio exects, and viewers would allow and embrace. The studio was not very keen on the subject matter and screenplay. In anticipation it would be a dud because of what they thought to be its bad taste, Hitchcock was granted a very low budget to make the film and most of the profits were to go to him. This proved to be a mistake. Psycho was a huge hit among audiences and made Hitchcock a very rich and well known director. Audiences praised Hitchcock and the movie. The reason for the studios and some others distaste in the film were its all around subject matter and some of the gory, revealing scenes. Obviously the most notable is the shower scene in which Norman Bates is seen murdering Marion Crane as she takes a shower. The scene was highly controversial because it revealed an unprecedented amount of nudity, blood, and violence for that time period. This kind of event was never (never ever ever) revealed in a film before. It is now easily the most iconic scene in American film history. Despite the controversy audiences were enthralled with the scene and the movie itself. Other controversial scenes included the opening one in which Marion and her lover Sam are featured sharing a bed together with Marion wearing only a bar and a scene where Marion is flushing a toilet that has toilet paper in it. Furthermore there was controversy over how the killer and villain Norman is depicted. Instead of the audience being left with disgust for his action the conclusion of the film makes us feel almost a sense of sorrow for him. It is revealed he committed the heinous crimes because of the psychological abuse he was subjected to by his mother, as a viewer we begin to attribute his horrible acts to being a result of this rather than him being inherently evil. The fact that the film was such monumental success despite its unorthodox subject matter for that time period is significant of the change in attitude toward film subject matter that was occurring in America. Viewers were becoming desensitized and willing to embrace and even enjoy racey material.

Hitchcock is known for many things, one being his use of McGuffins. A McGuffin is when a movie has an item or piece of information that seems to be important to the story but really has no meaning, it is used for suspense. In Psycho the McGuffin would definitely be the envelope of money, in the start we believe that the whole movie is going to surround Marion Crane and how she will get away with the stolen money. But Hitchcock then throws us off track when our main lead is killed within the first 30 minutes of the movie. I liked this aspect of the movie; I found it interesting to spend so much time on the plot only to completely change it, something I personally have never experienced before. Of course many people know the famous shower scene in Psycho, when Marion Crane is murdered.

About 90% of my music collection is film scores and I've been a fan of Bernard Herrmann since realizing he did a great number of soundtracks for Hitchcock films (North by Northwest is great, and some non Hitchcock films like Mysterious Island are good too).

Unfortunately the films popularity may spoil the shock value. Upon seeing the film for the first time I thought knowing the outcome may make the experience less enjoyable. This was not the case! I now see why Psycho is considered masterpiece! Hitchcock is a master of suspense. As the film begins, the plot immediately makes the audience uncomfortable. As Marion Crane makes off with the money, I had no idea what would happen next. Hitchcock adds in various ideas that lead me astray and even stress me out. When the police officer was questioning Marion and began to follow her, I felt her anxiety. Also when she was rushing the car salesmen I felt uneasy. This is great film-making. The emotions that Hitchcock draws out don't exactly correspond with the direct plot. After all we haven't even met the infamous Norman Baits yet and already I am on the edge of my seat with anticipation.We arrive at Baits Motel as the rising action rolls into the main plot. What an astounding actor Anthony Perkins is! Perfect casting for a psychopathic mamma's boy! He is an actor that truly understands his role. When he peers through the hole in the wall, spying on Marion you can almost tell the moment when the mother personality clicks on. The only thing that I could have found more satisfying would have been if we saw Norman doing his mothers voice.I love Hitchcock's style. When Marion was stopped by the police officer the way he shot the actors close-up really gave me the impression of invaded personal space and added to my discomfort. He also had great techniques for moving the camera into may different positions without cutting. When the camera follows Norman Bates up the stairs to his mothers room the camera does a 360 as it climes and we are left with the perspective of a bug on the wall.Psycho is a classic horror/thriller that I will watch again.

Alfred Hitchcock was at the height of his powers before he made it and it was only because of his standing that it was made at all. The studio was appalled by the idea of the film and released it very grudgingly and with the minimal of assistance. Hitchcock had to use much of his own personal wealth to fund it and released it in black and white, with a far lower budget than he was used to. Despite all this, when Psycho was released it changed everything.Released in 1960, it heralded the arrival of the 60's in more ways than simply date. It's extremely daring content was an early marker that indicated the coming changes in cinema. Sometimes people think that Hollywood truly changed in the late 60's with the release of Bonnie and Clyde. While it's impossible to argue against that film's influence, it can easily be argued that Psycho was even more ground-breaking and a full seven years older. Taking into account the cinema landscape of the time it was released, it's quite a wild uncompromising concoction that Hitchcock brought to the screen.There are several boundaries it pushed against. It opens with a scene of an unmarried couple \u2013 the woman partially undressed - in a hotel room just after sex. This was taboo at the time. Furthermore, the girl is introduced as the nominal heroine, even having her character's name displayed on the film poster. Yet she is brutally murdered less than half-way in. The disorientating nature of this is almost as shocking as the act of violence itself. Cinema audiences are just not prepared for a main character being disposed of like this. It throws us, confuses us and makes us realise we have no idea what is going to happen next. It's an utterly audacious move to do this and, incredibly, one that really has hardly been used since in the intervening fifty plus years. Hollywood still seems reticent in killing off its A-Listers in this way but Hitchcock was unafraid in subverting this 'rule' and the impact of Psycho is profoundly more effective as a result. Then there is the violence. The expertly filmed shower scene remains one of the ultimate shock moments in cinema and with some justification. For its time, it's incredibly brutal and it's here that Psycho pushed boundaries in the most direct and obvious way. In fact, Hitchcock partially decided on black and white, as he knew this scene would never get past the censors in colour. Now people died with their eyes open. Marion Crane stares at us dead on in a way that allows us little respite. And finally, there is the open depiction of sexually deviant behaviour. Normal Bates disturbing secret life is very psychologically dark, yet he is presented quite sympathetically. The direct presentation of these dark impulses was again quite unfamiliar to audiences of the time.The story has Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a secretary from Phoenix, Arizona, stealing $40,000 from her employer's client. After a couple of days on the run she ends up at a motel run by a nervous young man called Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). The structure of the narrative initially suggests that this will be a crime story of a woman on the run with a bag of money. But we have been cleverly misdirected and the seemingly standard thriller suddenly and jarringly changes into something altogether more sinister. Really, Psycho was a watershed movie in that it brought the horror genre into a recognisably real world. Beforehand, the genre always had the distance of either the supernatural or science fiction. Psycho stripped away this protective layer and in doing so made the horror more real and more terrifying. Amazingly, it has retained the palpable tension even today. This has ensured that it still feels quite modern and hasn't really aged at all. But it would be misguided to not acknowledge the black humour that is interspersed throughout and that only becomes apparent on re-watches. This is a result of a clever script but also excellent performances. The real stand-out dramatic scene being the late night supper between Crane and Bates, where there is such an uneasy and strange chemistry. Leigh and Perkins make this work so well; the latter is particularly brilliant in this film. So good it would unfortunately type-cast him forever.There are other collaborators too who need to be acknowledged too. Firstly, there is Saul Bass who is the legendary credit sequence guy. His work here is pretty simple and straightforward but striking nevertheless. And then there is, of course, Bernard Herrman whose score is one of the greatest in cinema history. Everyone knows the famous screeching that accompanies the murders \u2013 rightfully so because it's genius \u2013 but the melodic main theme is quite beautiful and truly evocative. But in the final analysis the bulk of the praise has to go to Alfred Hitchcock, as this incredibly provocative work of cinema art would never have been made without him and I think it stands as his greatest achievement.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 3}, "heading": "Psycho changed everything", "date": "2014-03-28T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2987805", "sentiment score": [0.0891, 0.2223, 0.1881, 0.3227, 0.1778]}, {"content": "Still considered a ground-breaking film today, Psycho shocked audiences when it was released back in 1960 because they had never before seen a graphic murder scene shot with such brutality, intensity and at the same time discretion.

The plot of Psycho comes with many twists and turns and is pretty unpredictable seeing as how it starts out very simple. A Phoenix secretary steals forty thousand dollars and takes off. But when she runs into Norman Bates, the peculiar owner of a small motel who is very attached to his invalid mother, things get complicated. The acting in this movie is nothing less than phenomenal. Janet Leigh does not have a large role but still was able to make the most of it. As previously stated, the acting is phenomenal-in the case of Anthony Perkins' Norman Bates, a little too phenomenal.

Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho might not be my first movie I watched from the 60's era but it's definitely the one creating a greater impact than the other. The movie has pure visceral feel and induces a thrill so powerful that you might find yourself quite intrigued by it. Psycho opens up with a scene with Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and Sam Loomis (John Gavin) in a rented room of cheap hotel in Pheonix. Their apparent actions and conversations give vivid impression that both are currently having an intense love affair and want to get married soon but are unable to do so since they can't afford the expenses involved. Marion is working in an estate agent's office and meets with a client who gives her 40,000 dollars to buy a house for his daughter.A desperate Marion steals 40,000 dollars from the client and flees from the town. Marion, on the run takes refuge in a motel called as Bates Motel, whose business appeared to be in total shambles. Even being strongly confronted by his dominant mother, the owner of the motel Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) warmly welcomes Marion with warm dinner and cosy room to spend the night in. Things turned horribly ugly when Marion gets murdered in the room of the motel by an unknown entity as she gets stabbed multiple times. The unknown entity in the movie will somewhat be perceived by the audience as 'Psycho' and the overall objective of cold-blooded murder however remains a mystery. Based on the novel of the same name by Robert Bloch, Psycho is a mystery thriller with the suspense not being kept on hold for long and becomes quite flagrant. Alfred Hitchcock has made an audacious effort to make such a thriller in which the title of being the 'protagonist' vacillates from one person to another quite impressively. You may not be sure who the lead character actually is but you are pretty sure that the film is not a bizarre scramble of sheer ambiguity.

The suspense is handled so well by Alfred Hitchcock , after all the guy's nickname is the master of suspense. Other great strengths that this movie offers is it's amazing performance by it's lead actor Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, he plays a great character who has been broken by his mother to insanity. The rest of the cast does a fine job too especially Janet Leight. The movie is also full of so many twist and turns most of these are common knowledge now but back in 1960 no one knew what hit them. The music, we cant forget Bernard Herman's excellent music score that fits the tone of the movie perfectly, the music was most famously used in the shower scene now one of cinema's most recognizable moments.The twist ending is great it will catch you completely off guard.

With her internal moral regret mounting, even conspiring against her to the verge of paranoia, she ultimately ends up in a dilapidated off-road motel run by the reclusive, but amiable Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), who literally has skeletons hiding out in his closet. When Marion Crane famously gets gutted in the shower by Bates' mother, her sister Lila (Vera Miles) and boyfriend Sam become aware of her disappearance and initiate a hunt. Similarly, her employer sends out detective Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam) to track down Marion and the stolen money.With a movie so awash with interpretations and reviews, not much noteworthy can be added, except from personal input, especially from the future-past perspective, as in: How does \"Psycho\" hold up against its contemporaries? And as such \"Psycho\", one of Hitchcock's best works, has aged pretty darn well, outdoing a vast majority of by-the-numbers rip-offs, due to the the ambiguous societal commentary lingering in between the killer rampage. Norman Bates, despite his awkward presence and facial tics, is by no measure a crazed psychopath, who deals in excess, instead Hitchcock affords his main antagonist a very thoughtful character structure, which also helps to build tension. Hitchcock, masterfully, builds context and content, especially with regards to the interaction between Marion and Norman, each running away from their own demons, suggesting that the difference between the two is much less pronounced, than we would like to believe. This gruesome take hits best during a genuinely fresh conversation between the two in the hotel office.Once the initial murder takes place, Hitchcock never lets go of a sense of tension, but the story focuses more on the thriller/horror essence, no longer affording space for such thoughtful commentary. Anthony Perkins carries the movie with his impish, offbeat, charm, delivering a still crisp and tense conversation with the nosey PI Arbogast. For the most part \"Psycho\" remains a gripping experience, even though age has caused many false notes to supplant true fright with corny music and overused shock gimmicks. As such the most famous scenes, including the bathroom murder and the big reveal, have lost their impact, referenced to death and outdone by the coming slew of slasher films.

Scared and tired,Marion decides to stop at a Motel ran by Norman Bates(Anthony Perkins),a young man that runs the Motel and takes care of his Mother. The stay at the Motel leads to horrific and strange turn of events.What can be said about Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho that hasn't been said before? The film is a flawless Masterpiece of cinema and is one of the greatest,scariest and most iconic movies of all time and is the first modern Horror movie that changed the Horror genre as we know it. Prior to Psycho,Horror movies from the 1930s to the 1950s had been done by Universal Films and Hammer Pictures and Horror films mostly dealt with monsters like Zombies,Vampires,Werewolves and creatures from outer space or were set in the 18th or 19th century in castles. But then in 1960 Psycho came out and changed Horror films forever and brought Horror into the modern world and gave viewers a different kind of monster which was a human being and Psycho would set the standard for Horror and Suspense Thrillers that came after Psycho and despite Hitchcock giving cinema many classics and Masterpieces Psycho is Hitchcock's most famous and iconic film. Psycho is a great film that right from the very beginning the movie pulls you into a frightening and terrifying nightmare that is relentless and powerful like a tightrope with white hot suspense that never stops until the very end. Psycho is also a great film because it gave audiences a new and different kind of Horror film that breaks all of the rules and conventions that are associated with Horror and Hollywood films with Hitchcock make people think the film is going to go one way when it goes another and the film gives you a sense of dread and offers no salvation or happiness. The scary and suspenseful scenes in Psycho are done with great timing and much detail and when the scary scenes happen they hit you like an unexpected punch in the face and your heart will be racing because with each scary and suspenseful scene Hitchcock is frightening you not only physically but mentally as well. The style and brilliance of Psycho would influence Horror films and Thrillers that came out years after Psycho's release. Probably the scariest and most suspenseful scene in the film is the famous shower scene,a classic and iconic scene that Hitchcock filmed with such a masterful stroke using clever camera angles and tricks making you watch in awe and terror. It's a scene you will never forget and will change the way you take showers forever. While the film is scary,Psycho wouldn't be as nearly scary without the atmosphere. During the 1950s,Alfred Hitchcock had filmed his movies in color but with Psycho Hitchcock filmed this movie in Black & White thanks to Jack L. Russell's beautiful and visually stunning photography which gives the movie a dark and beautiful Film Noir look that is harsh and bleak almost like you're in a living nightmare. The main characters in Psycho are wonderful because they are not Horror movie stereotypes or Cartoons but real people that viewers will relate to because of the horrific and dangerous situations that happen in the film. The screenplay by Joseph Stefano is amazing and memorable,with Stefano giving the main characters dialog that is tight and incredible. The ending of Psycho is amazing,scary and is an ending you won't expect or see coming. The ending of Psycho is twisted and shocking and is one of the things that makes Psycho a masterpiece.The whole cast is great. Anthony Perkins is excellent and iconic as Norman Bates,with Perkins bringing intensity and power to the role. Janet Leigh is brilliant in her most famous and iconic role as Marion Crane,with Leigh bringing depth and class to the role. Vera Miles is terrific as Lila Crane,Marion's sister. John Galvin is wonderful as Sam Loomis,Marion's boyfriend. Martin Balsam is fantastic as Milton Arbogast,a private detective. John McIntire(Sheriff Al Chambers),Simon Oakland(Dr. Fred Richman),Lurene Tuttle(Mrs. Chambers),Frank Albertson(Tom Cassidy),Patrica Hitchcock(Caroline),Vaughn Taylor(George Lower),John Anderson(California Charlie)and Mort Mills(Highway Patrol Officer)give good performances as well.The direction by Alfred Hitchcock is excellent and stylish,with Hitchcock constantly moving the camera and using amazing angles giving the film a great visual style and tone while doing a terrific job with the scary and suspenseful scenes. Masterful direction by Hitchcock.The score by Bernard Herrmann is brilliant,scary,intense and one of the greatest and most iconic scores in movie history and it truly matches the film's dark and frightening tone.

Caught in heavy rain & tired after a long drive, she pulls over to spend the night at Bates Motel whose owner-manager seems to be very much under the dominion of his mother.Throughout his career, director Alfred Hitchcock has enriched the world of cinema with some truly groundbreaking thrillers & despite that, Psycho feels like something of a first from him. It's his first stint with the genre of horror, it breaks through the barriers of censorship unlike any film before and over the years, it has played an major role in influencing not only films but pop- culture as well.The screenplay is a gem in itself for the story is cleverly written by Joseph Stefano & also features many memorable quotes. Filmed on a modest budget, the black-n-white cinematography only ends up working in favour of the film as it makes excellent use of sharp focus, smooth tracking shots & meticulous detailing in capturing its events, while also providing an ageless look to the whole story.Coming to the performances, the film features a reliable cast amongst which Janet Leigh & Anthony Perkins end up impressing the most. While Leigh beautifully captures the guilty side of Marion, Perkins as Bates is show-stealing considering that he starts out pretty calmly but steadily levels it up as the story progresses & is absolutely chilling in the film's final moment.Editing is also worthy of its praise for it paces the whole story ingeniously & gets its own moment to shine in what happens to be the film's most (in)famous sequence. Yet, the maximum contribution amongst all aspects comes from Bernard Herrmann's spectacularly terrifying score which makes its presence felt from the very beginning & ends up intensifying the film's overall cinematic experience by a great deal.On an overall scale, with its tense atmosphere that looms over the plot from start to finish, outstanding direction, tight screenplay, superb performances, stunning grayscale photography, clever editing & relentless score, Psycho is a breathtaking work of perfection that marks the creative height of Alfred Hitchcock's glorious film career and not only is it the most influential example of its genre but is very much the sole reason why modern horror exists in the first place.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Alfred Hitchcock's Magnum Opus", "date": "2013-10-14T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2887228", "sentiment score": [0.004, 0.0139, 0.0461, 0.4814, 0.4547]}, {"content": "Alfred Hitchcock directed this smash hit, a terrifying film that begins with dissatisfied Phoenix office worker Marion Crane(played by Janet Leigh) who impulsively steals $40,000 from her employer, and drives to California to meet her boyfriend Sam Loomis(played by John Gavin).

None of the other acclaimed aspects could' have been as highly regarded without the source material containing the magic found in the other production values. The script is perfect. Psycho works from the final scene backwards; every scene, every line placed in the film is working toward the goal of the final scene. The rare thing about Psycho's script is the change in structure. Developing the story of Marion Crane, we transition from her character arc to a story about someone else entirely. It fits like a seat belt being latched into the buckle. It's a story of a man who's suffered from repressed sexuality, mental abuse, and loneliness.Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins are used to their full potential and create a landmark duo. Leigh pushes her character to act with her humanity; Marion's scenes after her decision to steal the money are built with guilt and fear of getting caught. She's not a bad person, she's a desperate one. The Hollywood style of acting has never been as great as Leigh puts on for us. On the flip side of the acting spectrum, Perkins' work is intricate and open to interpretation in his method style acting. He brings nervous ticks to Norman, such as stuttering and anxiously nibbling on candy. Perkins recreates the word creep in his iconic performance and the final shot of Psycho may live as the apex of his career.Mise-en-scene is used regularly in Psycho to expose the undertellings of the story. In Janet Leigh's wardrobe, she's seen wearing a white bra in her opening scene. After she decides to steal the money, she's appears in black bras and skirts. This shows she's morphed into a darker character, on her way to becoming an antagonist. After she encounters Norman for the first time, Marion realizes she doesn't want to trap herself in an unwanted life. She decides to return the money, stepping out of the darkness she acquired earlier and steps into the brightly lit, white, pure shower.The intelligence of Psycho's camera-work, editing, and direction may be appreciated upon the first viewing, but to understand those aspects as all-time greatness and creativity within every shot is to know the final plot twist. Hitchcock uses the lighting to detail the character's faces when they are their most vulnerable and unstable in their statements to other characters questioning them. When Marion is being interrogated by the police officer and the car dealer, lighting can be seen darker with Marion and light on the other characters.The lighting doesn't stop there, especially with the character of Norman. Some lighting is shot to capture only one side of his face, making his face look half light, half dark (one side is Norman, the other side is Mother). Mirror shots of Norman use his reflection to symbolize Mother, too. When Roman is questioned by the private detective, the light hits his face 100% making it difficult for Norman to hide in the mother's half of his mind. He's trapped explaining his struggle to answer the questions. When the camera has a lower angle, it's Norman answering the questions, but there's a regular close-up, it's mother scrambling to answer the questions. Hitchcock uses backlighting and camera angels to keep the twist of Mother being Norman a secret until the finale reveal.Psycho may be the seed that first grew many horror phenomenons. The Bates mansion located above the hotel could be the direct reason haunted houses have become a popular attraction and source of entertainment. Alfred Hitchcock's direction is the combining force of all the aspects to make them flow with perfect pitch. Hitchcock creates tension that becomes so intense, it's as if we are living the fear of the characters. The use of musical composition was very influential of horror films, as well. The nails-on-a-chalkboard score startles the picture and is responsible for putting the audience on edge. The editing is tightly strung, in particular with the shower scene. As Janet Leigh has said herself \"Each shot cut is like a cut of the knife\", each stabbing of Marion is an actual camera cut to the next shot, creating a more violent and aggressive scene.Props are used in Psycho to tell the backstory of Norman and Mother that's never played out for us to see. The Bates mansion is filled with clues to Norman's childhood, Mrs. Bates' wicked ways, and Norman's methods of becoming Mother. The most important scene in the film takes place in the parlor between Roman and Marion. Not only is that the moment Marion decides to gather her things and give the money back, it tells a lot of Roman's psychology. The use of birds in the film to symbolize Mother's presence is overwhelming and some of the best use of props ever in a film.Psycho recently was ranked as the 5th greatest film of all-time by Entertainment Weekly. Not only has it skyrocketed in terms of artistic value in my eyes, it's become my favorite film of all- time. Mr. Hitchcock's direction far exceeds anything else he's attempted, working with the cinematographer and the editor to nail the fear and meaning of a perfectly sketched story, brought to life by two contrasting performances that will outlive other iconic portrayals. Though a few of the murder scenes look as a product of the film's time, everything is is made with such effort that Psycho can appeal to audience's interest in entertainment today. Twists have never been sharper with thoughtful tricks and genuine surprise for the audience.Grade: A+Rating: 10.5/10", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Hitchcock Exceeds Anything He's Ever Done", "date": "2013-09-23T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2874724", "sentiment score": [0.0367, 0.1932, 0.284, 0.4003, 0.0858]}, {"content": "Being a fan of horror films, I realised that I hadn't actually watched one of the biggest horror films that EVER existed - Psycho.

That's the about 7-minute scene in Norman's parlor where Marion has a bite of dinner shortly after arriving at the motel. To get an idea of its impact and significance, the setting is important. The parlor is dimly lit, casting shadows appropriate to the Gothic plot. Norman sits on one side, a stuffed raptor on the adjacent wall. It's shrewdly placed since the menacing wing-spread can background Norman when Hitch so chooses. Marion sits on the opposite side in a more conventionally lit setting, bespeaking her more conventional nature. Significantly, Hitch cross-cuts between them the entire time, never showing them in the same frame, thus emphasizing Norman's uniqueness and dominating part of the conversation.Now Norman is clearly unsure how to talk to the attractive woman alone with him in this, a private room. So he launches into a safe topic for him, but completely inappropriate to the light meal Marion is eating, namely his hobby, taxidermy. That is, how he likes to stuff birds but not the gore that comes with beasts. This tells us the important point that Norman is inexperienced socially, an aspect that fits in as the various parts of his nature come together over the movie's time-line. Throughout the tete-a-tete, Marion maintains a cautious but polite reserve as Hitch crosscuts between them. Her role here is mainly to draw the boyish stranger out. From taxidermy the dialog takes a more intimate turn. What emerges from the next topic, namely how to fill one's time, is that Norman is uncomfortable with his life with Mom. At the same time, however, he tries to casually laugh it off, one of his main defense mechanisms. Marion suggests that perhaps he should leave, that is, go away. But Norman senses something. He may be confused about a lot of things, but he's intuitive when he interjects that Marion must be running away from something, as indeed she is. At this point the conversation takes on a momentum that is revealing more and more about Norman's inner life. That's apparent when he starts talking ominously about private traps from which no one can escape\u2014how we \"scratch and claw\" (like a bird) but never to any avail. To Marion, this is a challenge to escape the embezzlement trap she's gotten herself into. To Norman, it's a disclosure of how he views his own life, and an excuse for not doing anything about it as though in his madness he could. At this point, Marion senses Norman's problem lies with his mother and suggests that he get away from the motel and from her. Once the topic turns to Mother, Hitch frames Norman in the foreground with the ominous stuffed bird (Mother) looming over him. Now we know Norman is indeed trapped and that Marion is venturing into dangerous territory. She accelerates the danger by suggesting that he should put Mom away, like \"in an institution or something\". This triggers a sudden, hostile response as Norman associates strangers and unfamiliar surroundings with thoughts of death, as indeed it would be for him. But true to his defense mechanisms, he does an abrupt 180 and laughs off the suggestion with the supreme irony that whatever her problems, at least Mom's \"harmless\". Then in another note of supreme irony, he trivializes her problem by saying that anyway we all go \"a little mad sometimes\". This of course would include Marion by inference, who now has a sense of her own embezzlement predicament and breaks off the conversation by resolving to return to Phoenix and face the music. At the same time, Norman reverts to his usual affable fa\u00e7ade. And the scene ends. But unbeknownst to Marion, she may have resolved one trap, but has now entered a far more deadly one.This is the central scene of the film. It's not the most dramatic, but it is the one where we gain important insight into Norman's mental processes. Now as good as the writing and direction are, it's really Tony Perkins's exquisite performance that makes the seven minutes absolutely spellbinding. Watch how quickly and persuasively he changes expression and mood. Because of his expertise, we know that something's seriously wrong with Norman, but can't be sure exactly what, while it takes the rest of the movie to find out. One moment, he's all boyish charm, the next he's glaring darkly with inner fire. Of course, Janet Leigh's superb performance as Marion should not be overlooked. In this key scene, her task is to politely draw out Norman's feelings, an essentially secondary role, but demanding in its own way. Note how delicately she balances her bites of food with proper emotional composure as this strange man reveals more of himself to her. Without doubt, this was an actress with more than just a pretty face.To me, Perkins' eccentric performance is clearly Oscar worthy, ditto the picture itself, along with Hitch's masterful direction. But industry prejudices against horror movies was just too strong then and perhaps now. Of course, it didn't help for Oscar purposes that the production was also low-budget b&w. But I doubt the audience impact would have been nearly as great had that unforgettable package been upscaled in any fashion. At the same time, a big part of the classic flick, in my book, at least, rests with that 7-minutes of emerging horror, so brilliantly understated.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 7, "votes": 8}, "heading": "A Key Scene in Depth", "date": "2013-09-02T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2862501", "sentiment score": [0.0238, 0.127, 0.2812, 0.4685, 0.0994]}, {"content": "As you should know, Alfred Hitchcock has been known to be 'The Master of suspense' and no other films that he has made, can prove it, so well.

In that sense, master director Alfred Hitchcock's psychological thriller is very easily a classic. What starts seemingly as a satire on human behavior, quite unexpectedly changes gears and becomes a crime thriller. There are moments where one actually holds his breath. The plot goes like this: A Phoenix secretary steals $40,000 from her employer's client, goes on the run and checks into a remote motel run by a young man under the domination of his mother. The story initially revolves around this secretary, Marion (Janet Leigh), but drifts after some point of time.

The movie was path-breaking in so many ways, and completely transformed the thriller and mystery genres. Its foray into psychoanalysis, the killing of the leading lady halfway through the film, the voyeuristic camera angles/glimpses into the lives of the characters, and the sexuality on film; all these completely changed the face of cinema. And not to forget John L. Russell's cinematography and Bernard Herrmann's legendary background score which give the movie its tone and impact.Janet Leigh is mesmerizing in her short, but brilliant, portrayal of Marion Crane. Anthony Perkins gives a heartwarming and powerful performance as the innkeeper Norman Bates.How can I finish my review without mentioning the famous Shower sequence? Legend has it that the scene was filmed over 7 days, and features 77 different camera angles. The nudity and violence are merely suggested, and not actually shown, and there lies the actual beauty of the scene. And the shots shown are through the views of the killer and the victim, and not that of a third person. Other than this scene, there are many other memorable and brilliantly directed scenes in the movie, including the climatic twist and the exceptional ending.

The man was an absolute genius and I adore his work. And just to get it all out of the way I love Psycho, just in case that wasn't already clear.In the late '50's and early '60's there was a flurry of low budget, mostly B&W horror/thriller/suspense movies made. Think the work of Wiliam Castle(The Tingler, House on Haunted Hill, Macabre)as an example. These proved mostly very popular with audiences, and it was this trend that sparked Hitchcock to try his hand at the same formula. The result was Psycho.(as a side note William Castle in turn made \"Strait-Jacket\" as a direct response to Psycho) The true strength of Psycho, for me, lies not in the Famous Shower scene or the brief outbursts of violence(few as they are) heightened by Bernard Herrmann's now signature score. The true strength of this film lies in the casting of Antony Perkins and Janet Leigh. They portray their respective characters perfectly. Watching the subtle nuances in their performances, the minor changes in expression, the inflections and tone of voice is just fascinating. There simply is no Norman Bates without Anthony Perkins.Even to the very last scene Psycho keeps you enthralled where the big pay-off of the story is not stereotypically the apprehension of a maniac(or psychopath if you will)or the solving of a crime with the comforting knowledge that all is well again. Instead it comes with the realisation of just how far down the rabbit hole you've truly gone, and that \"Norman Bates\" can be anyone or anywhere. Be it the unassuming shy owner of a roadside motel or even your neighbour.Psycho is simply a must see picture.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "A Masterstroke - Psycho is simply brilliant", "date": "2013-07-06T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2826228", "sentiment score": [0.0461, 0.1175, 0.1813, 0.3814, 0.2736]}, {"content": "Major Spoilers Below....\"We all go a little mad sometimes.\" Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is a suspense, thriller film that is still effective today. I have not seen a lot of Hitchcock's films and the ones I have seen are the most known; Vertigo, Rear Window, North By Northwest and now Psycho. This film has become such an icon in horror and thriller films that it becomes so hard for a person in my generation to come in this film fresh and be ignorant. This film is very effective as the story requires the audience to not have an idea of what is coming next.As I said before, I came into this knowing all the iconic scenes but luckily I did not know about the main twist at the end of the film. This film was based on a novel by Robert Bloch but developed to the screen by Joseph Stefano. I have not watched any other works by Joseph Stefano and I have not read Bloch's novel but yet due to popular culture the film kind of takes the fun out of watching this film. Though stripped off of it's suspense at times but the film's story story was still entertaining due to its characters. I admire the fact that the film decides to take an unexpected turn and switch the focus on Norman Bates rather than Marion Crane. I find Norman an interesting figure and is something of a mystery. I do tend to give a more positive rating to films that dives into human psychology, which is the reason I liked films like Identity. Lila Crane is a great substitute of a strong female character and doesn't sacrifice the presence of women, something that is lacking in this film in my opinion. The film overall is great and the character Norman Bates is something that have influenced future films.Alfred HItchcock has been labelled as the master of suspense. Though I haven't seen all of his films but I felt Psycho is one of the films that solidified his reputation. To me, this film ties up there with Hitchcock's other film Vertigo. The film still does feel like a product of its time and may feel a little date in its effects, like when a certain someone falls down the stairs, but I watched this with that mindset and not allowing its dated flaws to ruin my judgement of the film. Psycho is still something that should be watched by the current generation and, mystery and suspense fans.John L. Russell is the film's cinematographer and in this film he ensures that everything does, every angle and every camera movement, supports in creating tension and suspense. The camera, a lot of the time, follows the characters ensuring that our focus stays on them. Shadows are important in shaping the tone and supports the characters' personalities and intentions. Some of these scenes are so iconic in its cinematography that it has attributed to the film's influence. Hitchcock may have decided to have this film in black and white because it is much cheaper to photograph it that way but I think this style is also something that he desired to avoid that feeling of a set.Bernard Herrmann is a legendary composer who have worked on the most acclaimed films; Citizen Kane, Taxi Driver and North By Northwest but I think this is his most iconic as it has been used and talked about by either critics or the general public. The film's tense moments are accompanied by harsh strings that shocks you as it screeches. Without Herrmann's score then the film would not give that same effect as it would with it.The most crucial actor that must be chosen perfectly is the role of Norman Bates. Anthony Perkins has embodied the role of this damaged man so convincingly that it is horrifying to even think it. Janet Leigh was terrific, her acting did not outshine anyone but certain moments in the film like the suspicious police officer, shows more to her than a pretty face. Martin Balsam as the private detective was one of the most enjoyable ones in this film. I did not expect much from him because the last film I have seen him in is Breakfast at Tiffany's and he did not really do much there.Solid cast, beautiful black and white cinematography, legendary score, and great direction has earned this film a classic status and will remain that way until the end of cinema. I adore the psychological aspect of this film and the choice of black and white photography. This film has shaped modern thrillers and will continue to do so.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "A Film That Shaped Modern Thrillers", "date": "2013-07-05T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2825896", "sentiment score": [0.012, 0.0674, 0.2535, 0.5253, 0.1417]}, {"content": "Some critics believe 'Psycho' to be Director Alfred Hitchcock's Magnum opus. In my opinion, it's an masterpiece that set a new level of acceptability for violence, deviant behavior and sexuality in American films. Even before the 1960's, Alfred Hitchcock was already famous as the screen's master of suspense and perhaps the best-known film director in the world at the time. This movie just add to it with subliminal themes, subtext and images. The center theme of Psycho is the concept of multiplies identifies where characters are challenge to live through life under multiplies roles. Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is just that type of a character. She is unhappy in her job at a Phoenix, Arizona real estate office and living in a double life with her affect with strong will Sam Loomis (John Gavin). One day, Marion is given money to be deposited in the bank. Instead of depositing it, Marion takes off with the cash, hoping to leave Phoenix for good and start a new life with her love affair Sam. Rather than meeting Sam, she finds a nervous charming innkeeper Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) at the Motel, she was staying. He was control by his over demanding mother. Anthony Perkins gives a subtle performance here. She is taken by Norman Bates innocent charm, as she sees him as the fragile alter-ego of Sam. In many ways, Norman Bates and Sam have very similar stories, the only different is that Norman can't live without her mother, while Sam can. There's hardly a film fan alive who doesn't know what happens next, as the shower scene is probably the film's most famous sequence. In a way, the shower scene was like baptismal waters. Marion had decided to go back, come clean, and take the consequence, so when she stepped into the bathtub it was as if she cleaning herself of sin. I like the fact that Marion's underwear is white before the theft, and black after. Feeling in rage that Marion might steal Norman away from her when Marion suggests to Norman that he put his mother in a mental hospital, her mother strikes Marion, only for Norman to cover it up. When Marion goes off missing, her personality live on with her double, twin sister Lila Crane (Vera Miles) who finds herself staying at the Bates motel, just like her long-lost sister. I love how Hitchcock utilized and probably was the first to establish the writing technique of the false protagonist. The false protagonist is when the viewers are introduced to a character that supposed to be the main character, only to be removed from the story either by death or other means early in the film. By removing Marion Crane from the story, early on. It might offend Janet Leigh's fans, but Alfred Hitchcock's know what's for the best. One of the best image scenes are the mirrors in why show that the characters have multiply personality. Another running theme is the money. The stolen money that Marion carries about with her represents her dirty little secrets. Hitchcock goes so far as to symbolically link this pile of money to a pile of feces. Every talk about money is weaved into dialogue about how filthy it is. While the showing scene can be seen as erotica for Norman Bates; Norman Bates mother sees it as filth. Contrary to a widely told tale, Hitchcock did not arrange for the water to suddenly go ice-cold during the shower scene to elicit an effective scream from Leigh. But Hitchcock did tested the shock value of Mother's corpse by placing it in Leigh's dressing room and listening to how loud she screamed when she notice it there. Compare to Modern Day Slasher films, this film is really tame of violence. The film was known to be nauseating for some viewers at the time, even with it being shot in black and white. The novel is more brutal than the film version. It had a beheading no less in it. Alfred Hitchcock cut it out, and did stabbing instead. Even with its graphic nature, the \"shower scene\" never once shows a knife puncturing flesh. Alfred Hitchcock desire to prevent the shower scene from being too gory so he film the movie in black and white, while also trying to cut cost down. I think, the biggest reason why it is in black and white is because it's better for horror films with the use of shadows. While it is tame, the movie is still disturbing. Hints why the film still have the Rated R label. What might bizarre is how often the film talks about eating. Considering that the writer of the original book, Robert Bloch based his story loosely upon the activities of serial killer and cannibal Ed Gein, some of these constant references to eating could simply be a sly reference to cannibalism. One subliminal theme of Psycho is when Norman chats to Marion about his hobby of taxidermy. It's remind us another Hitchcock classic movie 1963's The Birds. By having Marion eat like a bird, and having a last name like a bird. No wonder why Norman wants to eat her all up, but Norman couldn't hurt a fly or could he. That's actually a form of symbolism. The soundtrack of screeching violins, violas, and cellos was an original all-strings piece by composer Bernard Herrmann titled \"The Murder\" is amazing. It works for the film so well. This film sequels that followed in 1983 are just mediocre at best. There was also a 1998's remake of the film with Director Gus Van Sant that was God awful. 2012 and 2013 was a big high for Psycho fans as Bates Motel started to aired on A&E. Anthony Hopkins star in 2012 film Hitchcock about filming the movie, and also a HBO telefilm call 'The Girl\" with Toby Jones as Hitchcock during the filming of this movie, Psycho.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 4, "votes": 4}, "heading": "I'm a little bit psycho for Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.

On the way there however, the weather had turned very bad and she was forced to sleep at a remote motel where she meets Norman, an innocent young man who seems to have a strong relationship with his mother, who is the owner of the motel, and he also seems very harmless. When Marion goes missing however Sam and her sister investigate her missing together and they come to a horrible conclusion. *SPOILERS* When the private detective Arbogast goes to investigate the house of Norman and his mother but he gets killed as well. Sam and Lila (Marion's sister) go to the deputy's office to find out about Normans mother but the deputy tells them that Normans mother is long dead and buried. They go to the motel in disguise as a married couple and search Marion's room, Sam is suspicious and starts to interrogate Norman and tries to make him confess to the murder but Norman knocks Sam out, in the meantime Lila goes to the house on top of the hill and starts to look around there. When she sees Norman approaching she hides in the basement and she finds Normans mother there in a chair but she is dead and rotten. Suddenly Norman comes in from behind with a wig similar to his mothers hair and also clothes that look like his mothers, just before he can stab Lila Sam comes in from behind and subdues him. The shot then changes into a police station where you can see Norman in a chair and talking to himself like he is his mother. *ENDING SPOILERS*Psycho was a rather revolutionary film when it came out. This was because of the shocking ideas, the good camera-work and new ways of producing. Nowadays the ideas aren't shocking anymore and the new ways of producing isn't new. The camera-work is still interesting though. Combined with the music and the special effects it created a lot of tension in some parts of the movie. Because of this the producer Alfred Hitchcock is sometimes called: The master of suspense. It is too bad that the movie had a slow progressing plot, because this causes people to lose their attention. Things like this show us how old the movie actually is, nowadays movie-plots progress really fast to keep the attention of the viewers, but at that time Psycho had a fast-progressing plot. The standards for movies have changed. In our opinion Psycho is getting past its expirations date. The setting of the movie is mostly at the motel of Norman Bates. The place has a dark atmosphere and especially Norman Bates house. The camera-work in the film was good because it was focused on a lot, for example in the famous shower scene over 70 different camera positions were used so you know the director worked hard on the scene to make it as good as he could. The film is also a first of its kind in many aspects, a toilet being flushed and seeing Marion in her underwear, of course nowadays this is not really special to us but back then this was very revolutionary. The use of sound in the film was good because it created a lot of tense moments an when the music started to play you knew something bad was going to happen. The special effects were bad for us though because we automatically compare them to the special effects that are used in films now even though we try not to and they are really laughable. Editing was used effectively in this film and it had to too, because if we again look at the shower scene you never see Marion actually get stabbed but because the film was edited in such a way you automatically know she did get stabbed this is also the case in the scene where the private investigator got stabbed. Then there is the plot, the part of the film that made the film so bad for us, the plot progresses very slowly and it was hard to not get distracted while watching the film, if there was any action which was rare it would only last for a couple of seconds or minutes if you were lucky. We thought the film was not that amazing for us. The film was hard to understand and it was a very slow story. You have to watch it several times to understand everything in full detail. This is very usual in Hitchcock's films so we could have expected this. The film was not very action packed in comparison to today's standard, nowadays we have much more action in films than there was in psycho. The special effects are not that special, but again that has to do with the standards from today. It was not an interesting movie for us however if you look on the other side of things psycho was a renewing movie. Everything was original at that time and the movie was made from a low budget. It set the standard for thriller movies today and the film will always be an example.

I had heard of Hitchcock's masterpiece but I had never actually seen and with myself being an immense film addict, how could I have possibly missed such a remarkable gem? I'd known the entire plot. Every twist turn and stab. I honestly thought I was capable of understanding exactly what I was going to get here, but boy was I wrong. Thrills beyond belief and spectacular story-telling. Alfred Hitchcock is an absolute cinematic genius. Choosing to keep the film in black and white, killing off his protagonist halfway through the film, pushing and pulling the audience in every direction he wants them to be in. His camera angles and overall eye for entertainment has yet to be matched by any modern filmmaker. This man and this film are not only responsible for revolutionizing the horror genre, but showing the world the validity of it. Expect to be mesmerized by this piece.We are given Anthony Perkins, who doesn't just play the role of Norman Bates, but he becomes him. The character is embodied with such power and perfection that seeing Perkins in any role but this terrifies me beyond belief. Vera Miles and John Gavin team up as Lila Crane and Sam Loomis. Together they weave a team of compassionate and caring people, searching for answers in a mind bending mystery. Miles performs beautifully. She's innocent and loving and just wants to find her sister, but there's this air to her that strikes me, making me wonder how complex Lila is capable of being. If you're able to portray a character to the point that a viewer wishes to know more about that character, I give you the utmost respect. John Gavin as Sam Loomis bored me at the start but soon he became ideal. Loomis and Bates are compared and contrasted in an ironically obvious but eye-opening light. They are both extremely handsome men but Loomis is intimidating, strong, manly. Whereas, Norman Bates is a shy, childish, coward. The scenes where the two actors battle in out in conversation kept me on the edge of my seat. Once again, I have to add that Anthony Perkins is a genius and every motion, reaction, and word that comes from him in this film delivers an unforgettable experience.My only complaint worth noting is the scene in which the psychologist explains Norman and His Mother to the audience. It's a bit drawn out and the psychologist is delivering shocking and heartbreaking information but there seems to be little reaction from him or anyone in the room. Rather than telling me what happened, I'd have rather seen it for myself, Something that's easy to do in film. But this scene is necessary and it won't take a single thing away from this movie.Overall, Psycho is one of the greatest films I've ever seen. It's a horrifying thrill-ride with a twist that no one will ever see coming and what it did for the movie world will never be forgotten. Alfred Hitchcock toys with our wildest emotions and fears and spawns a true work of art. I'll have to ask my mother what she thought of the film because, well, mother knows best.

It was enjoyable watching a black and white movie and then suddenly realizing you didn't notice anyway. Even the actor's clothes didn't seem particularly dated - apart from those bras of Lila Crane (Vera Mills) - but hell, Madonna was wearing those things only a few years ago. What I love about Psycho (and a lot of the older thrillers/slashers) is that it manages to invoke fear and intrepidation without gallons of blood spurting around the room, bones being sawed with grizzly sound effects, close ups of heads exploding etc. Having said this, Psycho did set a new bar for 'violence' and 'sexuality' in movies (apparently Hitchcock had quite a time persuading the studio to let him make the movie). The music is such an integral part of this movie and hits just the right tones denoting 'something really scary is about to happen' or 'it's OK,no one's about to be hacked to death but don't let your guard down'. I did 'jump' on a couple of occasions and that's kudos to Hitchcock's brilliant mastery of suspense. Vera Mills was extremely good but I found her 'guilty' acting a little overblown. What can I say about Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates? Nothing really, he was fantastic. He portrayed the many sides of his troubled character perfectly and was extremely convincing as an 'innocent, sensitive, na\u00efve Mummy's boy'. Other elements that make Psycho so revolutionary and 'deep' include the exploration of family 'bonds', the results of introducing a new family dynamic, and the idea of 'split personality disorder'.

This was my first Alfred Hitchcock film and I must admit when I watched it, I broke the legendary Director's first and only rule : \"The picture you MUST see from the beginning... Or not at all!\"'Psycho' is one of those films I put with the elite like Taxi Driver, Raging Bull, Amadeus and The Godfather Series. These films changed my perspective on film in some form or another and when I speak about Psycho, I'm referring to storytelling and camera usage. Alfred Hitchcock did an amazing job creating this film. Everything works! The story, the acting, the cinematography and the music! Hitchcock's efforts with the camera reminded me of 'Taxi Driver.' Often, the camera stole so much away from the actors' efforts when creating emotion on screen. There were positions and movements I've never seen before. The classic 'Shower Scene' reminded me a lot of Scorsese due to the fact of the quick cuts throughout and I'm not surprised Scorsese would take a few notes from Hitch.The acting in this picture is something people never really emphasize and it is deservingly so. Not taking anything away from the actors/actresses but it was how 'Psycho' was shot that people will remember forever. But the cast was great! I will point out that I really enjoyed Anthony Perkins' fantastic performance as the legendary Norman Bates. When you see Perkins on screen, it's as if he has an extra layer around him that you want to rip off to reveal something you shouldn't know. You can see he's hiding something of some sort and you want to just shake it out of him. He keeps you on your toes throughout the film and you won't be able to blink without missing a detail.Out of all the aspects I pointed out about 'Psycho', the music comes out as the triumphant winner. It's suspense at its finest! As Janet Leigh's character tries to escape with the $40,000, the music itself tells you everything you need to know about the emotions running through her body. The quick beats and violins' running imitating a heartbeat gives you goose bumps. But nothing is more terrifying than the screeching violins playing throughout the 'mother' scenes. A nice test everybody can attempt is to play the scenes without the music, you will see the impact the sounds has on the film. As every screech is heard, you flinch back and back with discomfort and want it to stop. Truth be told, Hitchcock originally wanted those scenes silent and we can all agree he would've made a huge mistake! It's absolute magic!Psycho is a film that everybody should experience not only for entertainment purposes but as a history lesson in terrific filmmaking. It's difficult attempting to review this film without giving away anything but if you haven't seen 'Psycho', don't make the same mistake I did.

I asked them if they would watch more Alfred Hitchcock and they said, \"Of course!\" What I'm saying is that this movie is amazing, certainly Alfred Hitchcock's best work and the greatest thriller/horror of all time, and that if anyone who is reading this and is in the \"youth of America\"; give classic (old) movies a chance!!

No more atomic age, bring on the psychopaths. Now, this movie isn't like The Exorcist or The Shining, where you'll have nightmares over it; but unlike those movies, this movie keeps you on edge constantly. The whole time, there's just this nervous energy, and you never know what to expect. Hitchcock always believed that there's no terror in the bang, just in the anticipation of it. There are these long scenes that just have you biting your nails the whole time. By the end of the movie, you'll be wondering what happened to your fingers. The movie doesn't rely on cheap horror movie gimmicks. It's not gory, it doesn't use jump scares; the horror lies in the dialogue, the performances, the cinematography, the lighting, the music, and the story. This isn't the scariest movie I've ever seen, but I still believe it's the greatest horror movie of all time. Why? Because it's the classiest the genre has to offer. Today, the horror genre is so dumbed down, and so unoriginal, that it's nice to look back and see that the horror genre can be done well, and respected for something other than blood and nudity.

I mean before I saw Psycho, all I really knew about it was the famous shower scene which I saw references to in parodies or cartoons or something like that. But this movie turned out to be one of my all-time favourites even though I'm not that big into horror films.I like how Hitchcock decided to do the film in black-and-white because it makes it darker and suspenseful. The story starts out somewhat slow, but I like the conversations going on as Marion is driving on the highway, one of the most suspenseful parts of the movie. But the magic really begins when it gets to the Bates Motel. I'm surprised Anthony Perkins never got an Oscar or even a nomination for his portrayal of Norman Bates, I mean he was born to play that role! I can't imagine any other actor playing him. I mean you can see that there's something suspicious about Norman but you can't figure it out. But he just seems like a nice, friendly person who \"wouldn't even hurt a fly.\" And what surprises me even more is that he didn't star in any other well-known movies after Psycho. That just shows how underrated he is as an actor. But I'm glad at least Janet Leigh got a nomination for playing Marion Crane and won a Golden Globe.The one scene that really freaked me out, and still does, is when Lila Crane discovers Norman Bates's mother's corpse in the fruit cellar, and then Norman comes in dressed as his mother and carrying a knife and revealing that he is the murdering mother. I wasn't expecting that in anyway at all. I can just imagine what people would've thought about that because movies were much tamer back then. This movie makes me afraid of walking in a dark room because I always have the feeling a shadowy figure might pop out and stab me to death. I've also watched the two Psycho sequels that were made in the 80s and they're good enough to watch but they're nothing compared to the original. But I still think the work well.Overall this movie has everything that makes a movie a masterpiece: excellent acting, excellent directing, excellent writing, excellent cinematography, excellent suspense and even an excellent twist.

Hitchcock had done creepy Gothicism before, such as in Rebecca, and he'd done charming murderers before, such as in Strangers on A Train, but he hadn't done a slasher.Psycho is what it says on the tin: it's about a psycho. Exploring the deep psychosis of a murderer was not something that had been done in Hollywood film before. We all know the shower scene but not everybody knows the nature of Bates' psychosis so I won't say anything on that topic. The psychiatrist at the end is a clumsy clunky Hollywood addition explaining the blatantly obvious. I fail to see that in 1960, the audience wouldn't have worked it out. It's a testament to Hitchcock that he still manages a creepy final scene. Bates may be a psycho but we can't dismiss him in the way that we may have dismissed previous psychotic villains.Of course, the star of the film is Anthony Perkins. Everybody else is either bland or annoying and quite frankly, you want them all to die (maybe not the hot guy). Janet Leigh as Marion Crane...thank god we didn't have to spend too long with her. She spends most of the film in her bra (now a horror clich\u00e9)and steals loads of money from her boss. It's interesting that Hitchcock chose to make her so unsympathetic.Perkins is very effective as Norman Bates, the proprietor of the motel that Marion checks into. He looks just like a creepy bird but initially he's quite sweet. It took me a minute to clock that he was going to be our psycho. One thing I will say on his psychosis was that the psychiatrist says he is straight, which I don't entirely buy. I think that's just to placate the audience.Now, Psycho has been compared to Peeping Tom (or rather, Peeping Tom has been endlessly compared to Psycho. See my review on Peeping Tom for more info). Peeping Tom came out a few months before and on the surface it has a lot in common with Psycho: both have a handsome man who is psychologically disturbed with parental troubles and murders women. However the major difference is that Psycho cemented Hitchcock's reputation and Peeping Tom destroyed Michael Powell's illustrious career. So what gives? Psycho has lingering shots of a woman in a bra, gore and explicit horror; Peeping Tom has no blood, only brief nudity and no explicit horror. Surely if any film was going to shock the critics, it would be Psycho? Yet the only thing that the British censors objected to in that film was a flushing toilet.Actually, no. Hitchcock was famously the master of suspense and had dabbled in types of horror before- it was obvious that he would progress to something like Psycho. Powell was known for his partnership with Emeric Pressburger, making beautiful innocent British films (although at times some of them are very dark). He threw a curve ball and we couldn't take it. In some ways, Psycho is a mystery story and in the moments when the boyfriend and Marion's sister are exploring the motel, it brings to mind some of the creaky mystery moments Hitchcock had in his earlier films (Stage Fright, for example). Peeping Tom is not a mystery story. Bates is a main character but Mark Lewis is our protagonist. We see everything through his eyes. Both characters are handsome and polite but once we know something's up with Bates, we don't view him in that way. We always know that something's up with Mark Lewis and yet he's so adorable and polite and we never want him to get caught. Ironically, there are many moments where he almost gives himself away and we're shouting at the screen telling him not to.As for the psychology, Psycho explains everything. Bates is a classic textbook psycho. Lewis is a very disturbed pervert but he's more than a Psycho. His problems stem from the sadistic experiments his father does on him. We see some, but not all. What we do see is horrible but it's only scratching the surface. It's a more interesting imaginative bit of psychology than Psycho.Finally, the cinematography. Both films do brilliantly here- there's lots of creepy jump cuts and close-ups in Psycho. A particularly creepy moment is when Bates is framed by lots of stuffed birds glaring down at him. And it's all in scary black-and-white but not the clich\u00e9 lurking in the shadows. But for my money, the cinematography in Peeping Tom is better. It's filmed in garish seedy colour, which makes it all the more scary. There's a clever bit of filming where Mark is looking through a grill with a birds eye view of the room and then the angle changes so we see the pens from his pocket falling down. The whole premise of Peeping Tom is a guy who kills with his camera and the cinematography takes full advantage of this. Filming in shadows and gloom is a clich\u00e9- luckily neither film does that.Psycho is still a scary film- dated in its treatment of the secondary characters but modern as ever with its treatment of the psycho. Loads of thrills and chills to be had here. This film changed the horror genre in America forever.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Classic influential horror", "date": "2012-10-30T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2696738", "sentiment score": [0.0384, 0.1621, 0.3075, 0.414, 0.0781]}, {"content": "Alfred Hitchcocks' \"Psycho\" still stands tall as one of the most riveting shockers ever made. At the time, it was an interesting experiment for the director, having been filmed on a low budget and in black & white. It introduced characters and scenes that became an enormous part of the popular culture and influenced a GREAT many films that followed.Based on the novel by Robert Bloch (itself inspired by the exploits of real-life madman Ed Gein), it manages one of the absolute best twists in plot to be committed to film, making us believe it's about secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and her impulsive theft of her boss' clients' money, only to jerk the rug out from under us in a now legendary \"shower sequence\". Marion makes the fateful decision of seeking shelter in the way-out-of-the-way Bates Motel, run by peculiar young man Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a seemingly wimpy person who's dominated by his shrewish Mother.It's a testament to how powerful and endlessly entertaining \"Psycho\" is, that it can continue to enthrall us no matter how many times we see it. Hitchcocks' murder set pieces are the kind you never forget, and they're made all the more so by the most infamous (and imitated) of all of Bernard Herrmanns' music scores. It really helps to drive the movie forward, and Hitch and company create some truly delicious atmosphere, especially when it comes to *that* house, looking sinister and foreboding up on its hill. Screenwriter Joseph Stefano does impressive things with dialogue and a top notch cast memorably brings the characters to life. Perkins is just tremendous in the role of Norman, so tremendous that the role and performance would loom large for the rest of his life and career. Vera Miles is wonderfully feisty as Marions' sister, who'll stop at nothing to find her, while John Gavin makes for a stoic hero. Leigh is winning in the role of the larcenous Marion and her scenes with Perkins are superb. Great character players like Martin Balsam, John McIntire, Frank Albertson, John Anderson, Mort Mills, and Simon Oakland round out the cast, while Hitchs' daughter Pat plays the role of Caroline.They all help to make watching this a rich experience, one that can look even better after repeat viewings, with elements (the bird imagery & references, for example) one might not fully appreciate on the first viewing.

Marion flees the city and goes on a trip where sees ends up staying at the Bates Motel, meeting the owner Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who has a very unusual relationship with his mother.Hitchcock is of course the master of suspense and throughout Psycho there is a very intense atmosphere throughout the film. There is constant tension and build up during the film with Hitchcock using long takes and conversations, dark shots and imaginary and that very famous film score. Whilst the film is a horror and slasher, Hitchcock allows us to know the characters and he plays to his strength as a thriller director, particular in the second half. This is not a film about violence and killings like a lot of modern slashers are. It is a film particularly at the time that aimed to shock you with the violence, not for you to linger or relish it.There is an excellent cast in the film and it is clear why the role of Norman Bates was so iconic for Perkins. Perkins gave Bates a nervous energy with his seemingly shy, nice demeanour which secretly harbours a dark personality and secret. The last shot of the film makes Perkins look very much like Heath Ledger's version of the Joker with his creepy smile.Psycho was a risky film for the time: bloody on screen violence was rarity, even when it saved a narrative purpose and the woman who is the main character gets killed off at around 50 minute mark. This is a story technique that is still rarity used and most films still stick to a traditional narrative. Because of the killing Hitchcock changes the style of film from a horror to thriller/mystery and Hitchcock is able to blend them together perfectly.Psycho is of course a classic film and great example that tension and likable/relatable characters are key for a horror film to success.

The way the main character is portrayed at the beginning of the movie shows that Hitchcock wanted the audience to sympathize with Marion, so now the audience experiences Marion's frustration, fear, anxiety. The constant use of imaginative voice-over experienced by the main character's conscience intensifies the emotional sharing. Throughout the movie the music suggests characters are in danger, experiencing anxiety or looking for something. Whenever the scenario presented is not in those conditions, the characters find themselves engaging in normal behaviors with little suggestion about what is prone to happen. Marion, at her workplace, engages in a talk with Cassidy (the drunk client who is buying his daughter a house), the way he acts makes the audience to sympathize even more with Marion's feelings and intentions. Various close face shots: Marion looking at her mirror, a hotel window reflecting Marion and Normal together, suggests some type of voyeurism where questions of privacy are inferred, portraying that a character is never alone and that there is always someone watching/being watched. From the moment Marion is on the run to California to be with Sam, with the money she stole, the scene where she pulls over to the side of the road to sleep and the police officer questions her sets the climate for the rest of the movie where again, close face shots are used and Marion's thoughts can be heard. Marion seeks shelter in a motel by the road when she faces a storm on the way to California, the remoteness of the motel she stays at intrigues the audience with what is about to happen. It's easy to assume that Marion is about to do something she shouldn't due to her reaction when she sees her boss crossing the street. Some events like Marion being by herself most of the time, seeking shelter in unknown places, being in a hurry when trading her car, suggests that she is in danger and creates a powerful suspense due to the fact that by today's standards someone in the situation she is, might be too vulnerable. The killer in this movie, normally portrayed as a \"monster\" to scare the audience, is shown as someone normal, which is scarier and creepier. The audience is presented with Norman's private world towards the end where an investigation is taking place. Masked shots gives the audience a peephole to watch the scenes through what intensifies any association the audience my have with Norman.This review points out fundamental elements viewed in the movie to link the audience's experience along with the characters' emotions.

This Psycho thriller was a classic horror movie in the 60s, with a score (soundtrack) that is breath taking.It also had four Academy Award nominations. Psycho is considered one of Hitchcock's best films, and it is ranked among the greatest films of all time.The movie is based on a novel of the same name by Robert Bloch which in turn was based loosely on the case of convicted Wisconsin murderer Ed Gein.Paramount felt the book was \"too repulsive\" and \"impossible for films\" and they did not like \"anything about it at all\" and denied Hitchcock his usual budget. So, Hitchcock financed the film's creation through his own Shamley Productions.The movie was then shot in black and white to keep the budget below $ 1,000,000.The movie story is about a Secretary who embezzled $ 40,000 from her company, to go share with her boyfriend.On her way to their meeting place she stops over at a motel, owned by Norman Bates, who has been long under the control of his mother and is out of place in this world.The famous shower scene, which was the murder of Janet Leigh's character in the shower, is the film's pivotal scene and one of the best-known scenes in all of cinema history.

Well what can I say about this timeless classic? Nothing really but I'll try. But first I HAVE to start off by saying that Alfred Hitchcock truly is the master of suspense and this truly is his masterpiece and he has had MANY great films and a handful of them have made Damian's Top 250 Movies of All-Time (The Birds, Vertigo, & Rear Window to name a few). But anyway there's nothing I can really think of to say about this film so I'll have to go into the story which EVERYONE knows.The story starts off with Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and her boyfriend waking up after an afternoon of sex. Then she goes to work and has to drop off $40,000 at the bank (also with inflammation that's A lot of cash almost or about $250,000 in America's currency). But she decides to runaway with it and stops for the night at Bates Motel where she meets nervous but the seemingly gentle Norman Bates who keeps her company and has dinner with her and gives his famous \"A boys best friend is his mother speech\". Then after that we ALL knows what happens next Marion goes to take a shower and the famous \"shower scene\" happens (and I could imagine how it was for people in theatres). So after she's killed by what was seemingly Norman's mother Norman finds her dead body and cleans up the bathroom and puts her body into her car and pushes it into quicksand. So then the second half of the film is basically Marion's sister, boyfriends & detective Abergast trying to find her but he's killed and the. They find that Norman's mother is skeleton and the one that's supposedly \"Norman's Mother\" is Norman himself!!!! So they apprehend him and Norman is taken away and the film ends there.Now like I said Alfred Hitchcock (may he rest in peace) truly is the master of suspense and this really is his masterpiece and my favorite of all of his films. The acting in this movie is amazing Janet Leigh (mother of successful actress Jamie Lee Curtis who would star in the John Carpenter classic masterpiece \"Halloween\" that was heavily influenced by \"Psycho\") was excellent as Marion Crane, but the real star of the film is the late and great Anthony Perkins (who tragically died of AIDS may he rest along with Mr. Hitchcock) who portrayed Norman Bates PERFECTLY he really seemed like a nervous, shy man who was afraid of his own shadow he played the part down to the T (hell of a lot better than Vince Vaughn in the remake that shall not be spoken of). Hitchcock's brilliant writing and directing has made this one of the greatest films I've ever seen to date and on Damian's Top 250 Films of All-Time this ranks at #29. This film really is amazing. I've only seen this a few times and the VERY first time I saw it the suspense just had me glued to the film and I couldn't look away again and I have to say one more time: bravo Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins may you both rest in peace. ***** Out of ***** Stars", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Rarely any horror film in my opinion as ever toped this", "date": "2012-08-13T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2658449", "sentiment score": [0.015, 0.113, 0.3851, 0.4128, 0.074]}, {"content": "I remember sitting down to watch 'Psycho' on Turner Classic Movies about four years ago when my mom recommended I watch it.

It was way ahead of its time and continues to impress today. This is where the term Hitchcockian came from to describe these psychological horror films that have been inspired by the great Hitchcock. It's been over 50 years since Hitchcock directed this film, and horror directors are still trying to imitate what he did. One of the things I enjoyed the most about this film is the way that Hitch fooled us all into thinking that it was going to be about Janet Leigh's character and ended up killing her off in the first half of the movie. I hadn't seen this film before, but had seen the famous shower scene thousands of times before. It's amongst the greatest scenes in film history considering the way Hitch filmed every shot taking the audience by surprise. I always thought that scene was the final one, so I was surprised to see it only 40 minutes into the movie. From that moment on I was sold and on board with what other unexpected turn the movie was going to make. Anthony Perkins' performance as Norman Bates was the highlight of the movie for me. He was excellent in his role and I was surprised he didn't get much credit for it. I think he was much better than the rest of the cast. I also imagine what a surprise the ending must have been for most people during the time since it was something totally unprecedented. I did see it coming now of course since so many films have copied the format, but I can only imagine the initial reaction. Psycho was also the perfect title for the film.As for the story goes it deals with an office worker from a small town in Arizona named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who is in her early 30's and single. She has to meet with her love interest, Sam Loomis (John Gavin), in secret during lunch hours in a motel because he is from out of town and buried in debts due to alimony payments. When she arrives at work from her break she stumbles upon 40,000 dollars that her boss hands over to her to deposit in the bank. During a moment of irrationality she decides to keep the money and begin a new life in some other town. She takes off as soon as she can and begins driving away from the city as fast as possible. Tired after the long drive, Marion ends up staying at a motel off the highway for the night. The motel is run by a friendly young man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who tells Marion that they don't get many visitors nowadays. He offers her something to eat before she goes to bed, and she accepts. She later hears Norman discussing with his mother about his invitation and discovers that he is dominated by her. Her strong influence over him worries Marion, but she is tired and just once to rest before continuing her trip. Norman may not be the friendly young man who he seems to be after we see him watch her from a peeping hole. What follows is the famous shower scene and then the story continues with several twists and surprises.I've heard many complaints about the final scene of this great film which was adapted by Joseph Stefano, from Robert Bloch's novel of the same name. I can understand how this scene may seem out of place, especially now because the audience is expected to piece everything on their own, but I consider it necessary for the time because audiences weren't familiar with the psychotic term or connotation. Of course the explanation seems out of place today because we all understand what has happened, but in the 60's this film was way ahead of its time and had no precedents so it was necessary to spell everything out to the audience. I may be wrong, but I still don't have a problem with that scene although I do admit it is one of the only scenes in the film that hasn't aged well. Hitchcock is one of my favorite directors and I wish more directors would make psychological thrillers as well as he did. Psycho is probably one of his most recognized works, but I still think his best movie all time is Rear Window.

The music is good too, and it also contributes to the tone of the film, probably even more so than the cinematography. Finally, and probably most importantly, the film is noteworthy for its storytelling. Alfred Hitchcock broke several Hollywood cinema traditions of the time, and created a film that contains elements that can be easily recycled, yet at the same time is very unique, and is a good mystery horror thriller.The story isn't all that great, but what makes it good and involving is the way it develops and unfolds.

Like I said, it's not the most extraordinary story, but it's structured in a great way. It tampers with some traditional narrative elements. It starts out seemingly normal in terms of narrative. Then, we are shocked at the movie's midpoint as Marion, our protagonist for the first half of the movie, is killed, and the course of the film is drastically changed, and what follows is a series of (like I said before) shocking discoveries and twists. The audience's expectations keep being flouted, especially in the second half of the film, especially in two major ones, the second of which I won't spoil for those who haven't seen the film. It doesn't have great story or character complexity, but yes, it's strong.The stark black-and-white cinematography used in the film is very good, and even further contributes the the tone of the film. Also, by far one of the most important aspects of the film is the music. Bernard Herrmann composed an excellent score for the film. The film works fine with its narrative alone, but the music really brings it all to life and supports everything. The music consisted of all string instruments, and the music is consistently dissonant and tense. The music, like everything else about the film, can be easily recycled in movies, but, like I said before, Psycho still has a level of uniqueness that really can't be matched.Overall, it's an important landmark in the history of cinema, and it's still a good film, even to this day - not at a four-star level, but still very good. I found it to be a very good movie experience.

Everything about this film is perfect especially the famous 'shower scene'.Visually, Hitchcock subtly represents these theories through symbolism, lighting, shapes (that reflect the characters personality) and dialogue. The most interesting and important concept that ties in with almost every other aspect of the movie are the constant metaphors that represent the psychodynamic theory of the psyche; the id - impulsive, the ego - creates realistic ways to satisfy the id's demands and the superego which is the moral compass that regulates the other two. Throughout the superego is represented in a number of ways; the policeman, the stuffed birds and Marion (just before her murder). And Norman of course represents the ego and id; although his conflict is brought to the surface through schizophrenic means. This concept that I have tried my best to explain barely scratches the surface of what is a movie jam packed with interesting analogies and metaphors. But all this complexity resonates from the focal exploration of the human mind and makes the audience question their own ethics.There is no sloppiness in this movie in terms of a visual and aural experience, as Hitchcock's objective of 'messing' with the audience requires and almost flawless film viewing experience; an that this is.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "By far the greatest horror/suspense film of all time.", "date": "2012-05-17T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2613025", "sentiment score": [0.0093, 0.0191, 0.0369, 0.2758, 0.6588]}, {"content": "Psycho is by far one of my favorite horror movies.

It provides chills as a ripped-from-the- headlines slasher flick, but its macabre surfaces conceal its deeper mordant cultural resonances. In Psycho, many of Hitchcock's major tactics fall under the wide umbrella of postmodernism. Although made within the confines of the last vestiges of the classic Hollywood studio system, Psycho distinguishes itself as a subversive postmodern cinematic text. Hitchcock's is the dominating presence in the film. From the beginning we are privy to dastardly deeds done by less-than-savory people. Yet, even as the brutality is ratcheted up (culminating in Marion's death), the audience remains engaged and more specifically entertained. The traditionally positive and pure elements of society when viewed through Hitchcock's lens are rendered resoundingly impure. Caroline, Marion's pestering co-worker, needed tranquilizers to survive her own wedding; Tom Cassidy heartily recommends the practice of \"buying off unhappiness\" to turn it into something approaching happiness; police and detectives fail to provide satisfactory protection; and in the Bates family one certainly begins to doubt that mother knows best. This is contrasted to the immoralities within the film. Sam and Marion's affair, Marion's theft, and Norman's killings are, without exception, attractively presented. The affair titillates, turning Marion into an erotic symbol. By the time of the theft, Marion has won the allegiance of the audience. Even the film's most legendary element, the shower scene, can today be viewed as more giddy than gory. It plays more as symphony than tragedy. It is a feat of timing and rhythm with precise and effective choreography. Traditional horror films dare the audience to look at the screen; Psycho dares us to look away and we simply cannot. The film itself defies convention and flaunts expectations at every turn. At the end of the first act, it abruptly transfers the mantle of protagonist from Marion Crane to Norman Bates. The transfer makes sense. After all, these are the only two characters in the film that truly matter. In the words of critic David Thomson, \"they are the only two players in the film whom Hitchcock liked or was interested in\". As a mainstream Hollywood director, Hitchcock's interest in these two people, one a thief, the other a psychologically fractured killer is in and of itself subversive of audience expectations. Psycho was released in mid-1960 still very much in the shadow of the outwardly wholesome, domesticated Eisenhower era. To have a film focused on such behavior in the era of Leave it to Beaver was not only bold, it was unprecedented in mainstream American cinema. Psycho's low-rent aesthetic of highway towns and motel rooms is unique in the typically more elaborate and glamorous Hitchcock oeuvre. In an era when films were bought and sold based on star power, Hitchcock bumps off poor Janet Leigh (herself only a moderate star at the time) by the close of the first act. Audiences thought they knew what they could expect from the movies, especially the ones made by \"Master of Suspense\" Alfred Hitchcock; but the moment that shower curtain opens to the ascending strings of Bernard Herrmann's score, all bets are off. No one and nothing is safe, not even the lifestyles of the rich and famous.Apart from its more coy and wily elements, Psycho is also a film preoccupied with surfaces and appearances. By virtue of the funhouse construction of the film, Hitchcock cannot be bothered with traditional character development. The four major characters of the piece\u2014 Norman, Marion, Sam, and Lila\u2014 act as doubles for one another. In Lila, we find traces of Marion. Both are traditionally attractive blondes, yet the sexual vivacity of Marion that her screen time so effectively showcases is dulled and diluted within Lila, who can seem pestering and frumpy in comparison. These parallels perhaps could be written off due to the sister relationship between the two, except that the more interesting parallels between Sam and Norman undermine any sort of quick fix. Norman and Sam share a similar facial structure and hair color. Clearly, Sam is meant to represent the more stereotypically strapping male suitor, whereas Norman is best characterized as meek and uncertain. Yet, throughout the film our impressions of the two men are colored in surprising ways. Norman, despite his compulsions, comes off as a caring and compassionate young man, shy but capable of deep and true understanding. Hitchcock, in a move of swift and delicious irony, makes Norman into the most sensitive and kind person the picture has to offer. Norman's final conversation with Marion before her death is the film's most intimate scene. Although the two start the scene as total strangers, it is clear that they have had a deep effect on one another by the scene's close. In contrast, Sam seems increasingly boorish and bullying as the picture unspools. He's certainly less interesting than Norman. Indeed, we learn precious little regarding Sam in the movie's first half. Despite her claims of love, Marion spends relatively little time considering Sam's views of her actions. His hypothetical thoughts never enter her mind on the run from Phoenix. Her deepest emotional connection in the film is with Norman, and Sam seems to share a more matrimonial relationship with Lila than he does with Marion. Yet, in their momentary connection, Marion and Norman shared something more lively and meaningful than Sam seems to be capable of imagining. This lively connection, of course, must end in death in Hitchcock's world. Hitchcock, ever the ironist.Psycho's endurance as a piece of popular art is quite a feat. In fact, the very existence of the film is worth championing. It is a film where commercial aims exist in equal balance to artistic ambitions, where those goals are allowed to be complimentary. It holds a mirror to a polluted world in order to reveal the cracks in the surface, an impure subject made enthralling through pure cinema.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Dares You to Look Away", "date": "2012-04-21T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2600130", "sentiment score": [0.0265, 0.1703, 0.317, 0.4125, 0.0736]}, {"content": "this movie is what Hitchcock was all about the over emotional characters to create tension, using the camera as another character interacting with the movie, has characters break clich\u00e9'e, and using suspense as information. these things are just some of the things that he really showed within this movie. in regards to the lighting of the movie is quite stunning, when you see the outside of the house he makes look very bright making it look welcoming. though when any character entered the house, it is very dark and mysterious. the contrast he used in the movie were quite interesting. for example when the lady is being killed in the shower the contrast of the blood on the white tile and white tub gives the flow of blood definition. another interesting thing about that scene is you never see the knife make contact with the lady. it always has a jump cut to a blood splatter or it running down the drain. over all i think this is one of his best movies, the way he keeps you on the edge of your seat makes a movie for me and a added bonus is when a movie can continue to do it no matter how many times you see it!", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Classic Hitchcock!", "date": "2012-04-18T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2598680", "sentiment score": [0.004, 0.0124, 0.0739, 0.521, 0.3887]}, {"content": "Picking the best Hitchcock film to watch is an exercise that will totally frustrate you.

Personally I can't find an explanation for its ratings, it probably lies in its originality, mostly concerning when it was made. Psycho portrays a story of this woman from Pheonix, Lila Crane (Vera Miless) who stole 40000$ from one client and runs away. She draws the attention from the police, so she decides to change cars and drives by night until she gets lost and finds a motel. She checks in in that motel, with a very peculiar keeper, Norman (Anthony Perkins), who revealed a very cool personality, indifferent to current paradigms, who lived with her very annoying mother, increasingly senile. Anyway, somebody enters her bathroom when she was in the shower and stabs her several times, presumably the insane mother. The missing money causes discomfort back in Pheonix and when her client finds out she's also missing he hires a private detective to look for her. He eventually gets to the Motel, but he is kileef as well, this time inside Normans' house, suspecting he'd be hiding Mrs Crane. Then, it's time for her boyfriend and sister to look for her.

With a minimum of complication, it gets off to a black-and- white start with the arrival of a fugitive girl with a stolen bankroll at an eerie motel.\u000bWell, perhaps it doesn't get her there too swiftly. That's another little thing about this film. It does seem slowly paced for Mr. Hitchcock and given over to a lot of small detail. But when it does get her to the motel and apparently settled for the night, it turns out this isolated haven is, indeed, a haunted house.The young man who diffidently tends it -- he is Anthony Perkins and the girl is Janet Leigh -- is a queer duck, given to smirks and giggles and swift dashes up to a stark Victorian mansion on a hill. There, it appears, he has a mother -- a cantankerous old woman -- concealed. And that mother, as it soon develops, is deft at creeping up with a knife and sticking holes into people, drawing considerable blood.\u000bThat's the way it is with Mr. Hitchcock's picture -- slow buildups to sudden shocks that are old-fashioned melodramatics, however effective and sure, until a couple of people have been gruesomely punctured and the mystery of the haunted house has been revealed. Then it may be a matter of question whether Mr. Hitchcock points of psychology, the sort of highly favored by Krafft-Ebing, are as reliable as his melodramatic stunts.Frankly, we feel his explanations are a bit of leg-pulling by a man who has been known to resort to such tactics in his former films.The consequence is his denouement falls quite flat for us. But the acting is fair. Mr. Perkins and Miss Leigh perform with verve, and Vera Miles, John Gavin and Martin Balsam do well enough in other roles.The one thing we would note with disappointment is that, among the stuffed birds that adorn the motel office of Mr. Perkins, there are no significant bats.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Psycho", "date": "2011-11-15T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2518810", "sentiment score": [0.0165, 0.2137, 0.5531, 0.2077, 0.009]}, {"content": "Even amongst classic film legends such as Vertigo (1958) and The Birds (1963), arguably Alfred Hitchcock's most famous movie is Psycho (1960).

That being said, after viewing this original, and obviously much better version, it is safe to say that Hitchcock would roll over in his grave if he could see what his work had become. This film,(the original) is a stunning piece of visual and visceral beauty. It deals with a myriad of issues that affect the human condition, namely greed, love,psychosis, and fear, just to name a few. This film, more than being a first rate horror movie, is at its core, a story about people. Granted, in this instance, we are talking about some truly screwed up people, but people none the less. The film had a gritty, intense feeling, yet a smooth and refined look. Those two contrasting elements went a long way to truly sucking the viewer into what he or she was watching. Additionally, the music was downright eerie; this was so much the case that when I was viewing the movie at home, I paused it to turn on more lights in my house. That music just had some supernatural way of sending chills down my spine. For the characters themselves, Perkind does what one could expect him to do when tasked with such a mentally taxing role, he shines. Perkins plays the part of Norman Bates very well, as does he Norman's mother. Janet Leigh also brings a strong presence to the screen in her role of the misguided heroine. If I had one major critique of this film, it would be that it ended almost too abruptly. There is this slow creeping buildup to the action, to Bates having a showdown at the climax, and then, poof, its over. Norman is jail, clearly still crazy, and thats that. I would have liked to have seen a little more in that realm. Understandably, Hitchcock was a particular man who believed in less being more, but I feel that way all the same. In regards to Hitchcock, not much needs to really be said. This film is cinematic genius that has yet to be rivaled in terms of cinematography and overall mis-en-scene. Everything is modern, yet still very creepy. That is an especially nice touch.

They were stimulated by sheer, out-and-out cinema. Hitchcock consciously shot Psycho not with his high-priced feature regulars but with his TV crew. Lengthy segments hold no dialogue. In its gut sensation, Psycho fits better alongside shoestring noir like Detour than with Hitchcock's own chic Technicolor thrillers like Rear Window or Vertigo. In this way and in its starring use of Janet Leigh, Psycho is as much a companion piece with Touch of Evil as it is Hitchcock's arguably most socially pivotal film.But no other Hitchcock film had more effect. He's directing us. It was the most staggering film 1960 moviegoers had ever experienced. You couldn't be today's pervasive moviegoer: Walking in late, you'd be waiting to see the star after she's disappeared from the action. Plus, the internet would've shattered any possibility of preserving the movie's genuine shocks, none of which one could've anticipated Hitchcock had in store without it. Modern moviegoers would've ruined this film for themselves before even walking in. He didn't just direct movies. He directed us. He directed several subsequent decades of movie plot expectations.Of course, today's generation can still see it as a fearsome, ingenious thriller despite knowing all about the shower scene that would've been like the revelation of Luke Skywalker's father in 1960 terms rather than 1980 ones. It's all owing to Hitchcock's imagination in two matters not as obvious: The pure subjective telling of Marion Crane's story, and her rapport with her new host. Hitchcock's trick is dedicating his thorough concentration and flair to handling them like they'll be expanded upon for the whole remaining film.Anthony Perkins is uncanny in establishing the thorny character of Norman, in a performance that has become momentous. He lets us know there's something deeply amiss with Norman, and yet he has a young man's congeniality, stuffing his hands into his pockets, hopping onto the porch, beaming a toothy greeting. Only when discussion becomes personal does he begin to hesitate and sidestep. He evokes our empathy right alongside Marion's.Nearly every present-day viewer is spending that whole time anticipating the spectacle of murder in store. However, seeing the shower scene today, various elements are notable. Unlike contemporary horror films, Psycho never sees the knife actually striking flesh. We see no wounds. Herrmann's slicing strings deputize for more gruesome sounds. And yet this remains the most famously shocking of cinema's slasher deaths, suggesting that graphic details are more shocking in our mind's eye and ear depending on their circumstances and creativity.The terror of the rug being yanked swiftly and completely from beneath us is followed by Norman's painstaking erasure of the whole staggering affair. Hitchcock is subtly swapping protagonists. The new one killed the old one, yes, but we relate to Norman because, if we killed somebody, we'd be devoured by paranoia and remorse, just like him. The car sinks, then lingers. Norman watches fixedly, until it's ultimately submerged beneath the swamp.Checking one's feelings, it dawns that we want that car to sink, which is what Norman wants. This is one of the most daring exchanges in Hitchcock's sustained custom of stage-managing the audience itself. Psycho's legend and luster will never die because, when innumerable films are over and done as the credits roll, it ties as candidly with our apprehensions as movie-making form can: That any one of us may impetuously commit a crime, our dread and paranoia of the police, our nightmares of becoming the quarry of a madman, and naturally, of failing our mothers.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "The Persona of Horror Films", "date": "2011-10-24T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2507990", "sentiment score": [0.0803, 0.2317, 0.2256, 0.3133, 0.1491]}, {"content": "When this film was released in 1960, it literally took the world by storm.

Alfred Hitchcock had just seen huge success with North by Northwest, and he was considered a master of slow burning, suspense cinema. He could have had any budget he wanted, any cast he wanted - in fact he could have done anything he wanted.So what did he do? He took a cheap TV crew, a virtually unknown cast and a script that a lot of people weren't keen on and he filmed it. He was the only one sure that it would work - so sure that he traded his standard paycheck for 60% of the net profits (earning him the equivalent of $150 million in today's money).The result...? The original slasher film that instantly changed the concept of horrors, thrillers and villains. This might not be as complex as Vertigo, or as relevant as Rear Window, but this is the film that changed cinema and paved the way for the likes of The Exorcist, Scream and most other slashers, horrors and thrillers. Hitchcock created a piece of cinema history with this film, and you would be hard pressed to find any film maker since who hasn't at some point used Psycho for reference.Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a lost woman. She wants to get away from everything - her job, her home, her boyfriend, her life. Her chance comes one afternoon when a rich tycoon leaves $40,000 in cash as a deposit for a house. Instead of taking the money to the bank, Marion steals it and goes on the run. After two days, she finds herself a little lost, but near a motel - The Bates Motel. She meets Norman Bates, a shy man who is looking after his invalid mother. She and Norman have a conversation, where she decides that she should go back home and face up to what she has done. However, that night, she is violently murdered by someone, and this coincides with an investigation into her disappearance - an investigation that leads to the best of Hitchcocks's climaxes.What makes this film so good? Well, Hitchcock said it best himself \"It wasn't a message that stirred the audiences, nor was it a great performance...they were aroused by pure film.\" This film exists only to terrify us, entertain us, move us, thrill us. There is no message, there is no moral lecture. This film is about one director's vision to take an audience on a roller-coaster ride of thrills and chills. And this film does that to perfection. Nearly all of Hitchcock's most memorable action is in this film (the infamous shower scene is just one), and they are handled so incredibly well that even now they can't cease to entertain. The direction is the winner here. The carefully planned shots, the black and white images, the lighting, the shadows - nothing here has been left to chance and everything has been thought out so, so well. Stanley Kubrick is often accredited with the 'Kubrick stare'. Yet it might well be that he took that idea from Hitchcock, who's final shot of Norman Bates is one of the most chilling and unforgettable shots in film.Of course, whilst this film is brilliant almost exclusively because of Hitchcock's expert direction, we can't forget the cast. Janet Leigh was immortalised in her role as the ill-fated Marion Crane and she does a wonderful job as the woman who is essentially lost in her own life. Martin Balsam adds a touch of class with his portrayal of Arbogast, the private detective. And Vera Miles is strong and effective as Marion's worried sister.But, this acting in this film is virtually owned by Anthony Perkins as the truly chilling Norman Bates, who is arguably the best villain in film. Every second that he is on screen, you know there is something wrong, you know that this sweet, innocent, shy man is hiding a terrible secret. You're afraid to know what it is, but Perkins uses the screen to tease, to make you want to know more about him even though you know it's horrific. Perkins was so good in the role that it actually typecast him and hindered the rest of his career.Between Hitchcock's direction and Perkins acting, there is enough horror to last a lifetime. But added to the strong cast, the wonderful plot and the exceptional soundtrack by Bernard Herrman, and what we have here is something that is truly original, truly groundbreaking and remains a huge milestone in cinema.This is pure cinema at its best.

I first saw the pointlessly faithful remake and I also read Robert Bloch's novel (which is the same in most respects). So, the movie was basically 'spoiled' for me, though with all of the references in popular culture you'd be hard-pressed to go into the movie 'fresh' to begin with. For a movie that hinges on a pair of twists, that's a considerable issue. That's not to say that the movie doesn't have other impressive elements, though.Janet Leigh received an Oscar nomination for her performance but as far as I'm concerned Anthony Perkins easily outdid her. He went unrecognized by awards bodies at the time but the character of Norman Bates is now one of the most famous creations in cinema. In support, Martin Balsam is a welcome sight while Vera Miles & John Gavin are acceptable though they aren't really given a lot to work with.Meanwhile, Hitch's direction was expertly handled, as always, and it resulted in the last Oscar nomination of his career. The cinematography was also Oscar nominated but I wasn't especially impressed by it, though I will say that the Oscar-nominated set decoration/art direction was indeed worthy of recognition. Bafflingly, Bernard Hermann's now-legendary score seems to have been completely ignored at the time.In the end, I think that \"Psycho\" ranks a bit below Hitchcock masterpieces like \"Rear Window\" & \"Vertigo\". Admittedly, there are some absolutely great parts but it also starts slow and has an overreliance on twists (which you might already know even if you haven't seen the movie).

Adapted from the 1959 novel of the same name by Robert Bloch, 'Psycho' begins with a bang, and ends with some haunted images. Norman Bates is a person, who is described as disturbed & neglected. In my opinion, Norman Bates is a person, who became the animal he was, because he lost his innocence too soon. He wanted to live, but when he thought he couldn't survive anymore, he took up violence to breath. It's a twisted personality, that shocks you & leaves you numb!Joseph Stefano's Adpated Screenplay is nearly flawless. There is hardly a moment when the film loses it's momentum.

The Lens-Man has done a masterful job. Editing by George Tomasini, is superb! Art-Direction, is scary!Performance-Wise: Anthony Perkins plays Norman Bates, shockingly.

It's a vanguard suspense picture. From the amazing score by Bernard Herrmann to the infamous shower scene, this film will always be timeless. The films opens with the kinetic credits, made up of black and gray lines, done by Saul Bass. The film gains more suspense with the musical score made up only by strings. The film's dialogue manages to keep the film interesting, including the parlor scene, between Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, which lasts about 10 minutes, then finally, there's the shower scene, which took a week to film, and it's probably the best scene in movie history. 78 different shots in 45 seconds and it was shot wonderfully. There are only 2 murders in this film, yet this film was the first \"slasher\", which inspired John Carpenter's \"Halloween\", \"Friday the 13th\", \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" and a couple more. It's amazing thinking that this one movie did that all. I think this film probably has the most shocking ending in movie history. It freaked me out and I could only imagine how scary it must have been seeing it in a theater back in it's original 1960 release. The film's 6 and a half minute trailer, with Alfred Hitchcock giving a tour of the Bates Motel is only a teaser, so it doesn't tell you much about the film, so I wonder how shocking the shower scene must have been. Altogether, \"Psycho\" is one of Alfred Hitchcock's masterpieces, and I think it's probably my favorite film of his. From the amazing acting from Janet Leigh, Anthony Perkins, John Gavin, Vera Miles, and Martin Balsam to the surprisingly small $800,000 budget to the infamous Bates Motel and shower scene, along with the reputation this movie earned (#1 on AFI's 100 Years...100 Thrills and #14 on 100 Years...100 Movies), this film is defiantly the best shocker film from the best director of all time, Alfred Hitchcock.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "The best suspense motion picture ever made!", "date": "2011-08-01T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2467715", "sentiment score": [0.0288, 0.0674, 0.0905, 0.3258, 0.4875]}, {"content": "IMDb Top 250: 24 Psycho is one of the most iconic films ever. The simple name, the menace, the immortal shower scene. the immortal, impossible- to-form-as- words screech of the violins during the most intense scenes in the movie. Psycho has stood the test of time, even 50 years later.It's still important to know that this film has aged, but only because cinema evolved. Movies became more graphic and visceral, but Psycho can still ensnare you in its grasp. Hitchcock is a brilliant director, it seems that everything is so easy to him. He has nine films on the 250, more than anyone else.It's interesting: over a half hour goes by before Marion reaches the Bates Motel,and the film is one hour fifty minutes. Time is taken to set up a plot and develop characters, which happens less and less today. Hitchcock takes his time... and when he strikes, there is true terror. The plot moves along, never taking too much time, and everything wraps up well.Most of the acting is fine, but Anthony Perkins stands out. 1960 must've been a strong year for him to not be nominated for Best Actor. His casual walk, his kind smile, it's unnerving. Something's up with Norman Bates. But the little things make it: his eye movements, muscle twitches- especially those- make him the star of the show.Yeah yeah yeah... the shower scene. Truth is, it's probably the most aged scene in the movie. But I won't dwell on something most of you already know.I was surprised by the music. While the screech is universally-known in film circles, I was impressed with the rest of the music, which fits the film completely.Psycho is an experience that must be seen by any film fan.

That in itself can be a problem, because you're expecting a lot when you watch it for the first time. Unfortunately, for me at least, this didn't quite live up to its billing. It was a good movie, Alfred Hitchcock did a good job of directing with a number of what are today recognized as typical \"Hitckcock-ian\" touches, particularly with some very effective camera work, and basically the cast, headed by Anthony Perkins as motel owner Norman Bates and supported by Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, John Gavin and Martin Balsam (I would say in that order of importance to the story) did a fine job. Still, I was expecting something more.First, I would call this more of a suspense movie with a touch of slasher movie thrown in than a horror movie, although that's admittedly through a modern lens. There are really only a couple of scenes that were \"horrific\" - one being the famous shower scene and one being the revelation of Norman's mother near the end of the movie. Otherwise you get a mystery - with the end surprise being fairly clearly telegraphed to anyone who was paying attention. The suspense starts with Marion (Leigh) stealing a large sum of money from the real estate agency where she works and running off, eventually coming to the Bates Motel to spend the night. Since the murder in the shower is the classic scene of the movie, you don't expect it to come as early as it does, and you don't expect that so much of the movie is going to revolve around Lila (Miles) and Sam (Gavin) as they search for Marion. Somehow, I expected to see more of Janet Leigh. Still, there is good suspense even if the surprise about Norman's mother is pretty clear from even a mile away.What knocked this down a bit for me, though, wasn't the obvious solution to the mystery. It was the seeming need to offer a very in depth psychological explanation near the end of what Norman was all about. Maybe there was a sense that movie-goers in 1960 would need such an explanation. I found what was virtually a closing soliloquy (and a very long one) by Simon Oakland playing a psychiatrist who's called in to examine Norman to be tedious in the extreme, and largely unnecessary; filled with psycho-babble. Norman could have been explained - if an explanation was felt necessary - much more succinctly.One can't diss this movie. There's really very little wrong with it, except that its reputation makes it very hard for it to live up to when you watch it. Undoubtedly, when watched with late 20th-21st century eyes (well conditioned to the point of being almost oblivious to slasher-type violence) it comes across as a bit dull, frankly. Equally undoubtedly, it didn't come across that way to audiences in 1960. Still, I found it to be a little bit of a letdown compared to what I was expecting of it.

Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, sadly, never were given better parts. Leigh lived to be nearly 80 years old, so this part must have been somewhat of a annoyance to her. It probably didn't help that she had one of the most famous ex-husbands and daughters in the world. We all know what fate had in store for Perkins.Seen today, the movie is a bit tame and slow at times, but what it must have felt like for a 60s audience to see a film that was basically about sexual desires, although no explicit sex is shown. Look at one of the first scenes, where Marion is talking to an investor. He checks her out from top to bottom and makes an obvious play for her in full public. I can't recall I have ever seen such a scene from a movie that was made in the early sixties, and have rarely seen it in a movie made up and until 1966. The reaction from Hitchcock's daughter is also rare to see in a mainstream film from that time. She just treats it like it was something that happens every day. That was particularly unheard of during the rather strict 50s.More talk about sex. Janet Leigh in the white and black bra. I still don't know how they got that past the censors at that time. Hitchcock must have had an enormous field day with those shots. Also, the shots of Leigh's stand-in, where you actually see a very quick shot of breasts. Unbelievable. It's funny to dwell on this today where you can see pornography every minute of the day but for a 60s audience? That took a lot of guts to put that in.As for story, it is not the most original. Mamas boys were well depicted even to the point of insanity as way back as Jimmy Cagney's part in The Public Enemy. The execution, however, was of course something new. I do think my interest fell a little bit after Vera Miles comes on-screen. She is a good enough actress, but her part is thoroughly bland. So is John Gavin's, although he does match wits with Perkins in a rather smart scene at the end of the film. Martin Balsam as the private investigator is brilliant. In the scene with him and Perkins, you sense just how smart both of these people are. Perkins stumbles a bit in his testimony but doesn't really give the detective any conclusive evidence of guilt either. In a more mainstream film the detective would have been smarter than the crook.You could analyze this movie to death and many have. What you cannot do is diminish it's importance.

I simply admire the dexterity of the film in exuding its horror-arousing atmosphere. Hitchcock manufactures one of the most disturbingly creepy-cum-maniac killer in the history of cinema. The Oedipus complex patient Norman Bates is a lively product of the hermetic seclusion amid people and a emblem of the loss of morality, also the kill-after-the-epiphany scenario has never blemished its charisma even after 50 years.

Anthony Perkins has such a multi-faced once-in-a-lifetime role and it would be an unforgivable sin if he had ruined it (two sequels PSYCHO II and III are perfectly justifiable spin-offs). Vera Miles, John Gavin plus other supporting roles, on the other hand, are the victims of Hitchcock's \"actor equals animal\" methodology, they are more like props than real flesh.

What this movie managed to do at that time in the 60's was remarkable. There had never been anything like this made up to that point. It's the start of a great sub genre known as the \"slasher film\". The story is of a troubled man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and a woman on the run named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh). Marion leads an unfulfilled life and one day decides to embezzle $40,000 from her employer. While on the run, she stops off at the infamous Bates Motel to think things over and get some rest. While taking a shower, an unseen assailant who resembles a large woman attacks her with a knife, killing her. We soon are led to believe it's Norman's mother who committed the crime. It's then we see Norman cover it up for her. Many people question the whereabouts of Marion over the next few days including her boyfriend and sister. They, with the help of a private investigator, discover she was at the Bates Motel. But when entering the house up on the hill behind the motel, the discovery they make is much more chilling then could ever be imagined.Psycho is an all time classic by suspense and psychological icon Alfred Hitchcock. This was definitely his best work. The Birds was also excellent as was Rear Window, but this will always be his best known piece - and for good reason. The performances by Perkins and Leigh in particular was very understated and very well done. Watching it the first time, you really are drawn into the story and the mystery of the crimes taking place. Of course, after a few viewings you know the plot and the killer's identity. This is one of those horror movies that never gets old to me and never feels boring. Each time I watch it, I pick up something new.

But the Master had a little surprise for those who thought they've been scared enough and could never be surprised again \u0085 And how wrong they were \u0085 It's admirably surprising that such a great film came so lately in a career when most of the directors generally start losing their touch. But this is only one of the numerous unexpected and fascinating aspects that make this simple film, an \"accidental\" masterpiece. And I use this word as a compliment since the greatest masterpieces like \"Casablanca\" or \"The Godfather\" were unintentional too.The elements that make \"Psycho\" a masterpiece could have been taken as cinematic tricks deliberately inserted to create a feeling of originality, but then, such tricks would have sublimated the film, making it even more glorious and 'cinematic', which is not the case here. And I think I loved \"Psycho\", for the same reasons I disliked \"North by Northwest\" \u0085 In the former, Hitch used up all the style until it became a caricature: a too contrived plot, a too heroic ordinary hero, a dull love interest, a grandiose climactic scene \u0085 \"Psycho\" doesn't have this pretentious elegance and almost looks like a TV or a B-movie \u0085 it's the less Hitchcokian stylishly, but ironically, the most defining of his films.\"Psycho\" starts with probably the most thrilling score ever, the linear design combined with the shrill violins' sounds are the perfect illustration of how a music can embody the main feeling of a film, as if Bernard Herrman is already warning us about a horrifying surprise\u0085 that'll make our hearts pound as fast as this melody \u0085 its contribution to the film's emotional impact is indisputable. The next shot transports us to Marion Crane's apartment where we she lies in bed with her lover, undressed and intimate like in a campy soap opera \u0085 a lousy apartment with two people without the 'Grant and Kelly' romantic appeal audience got used to. An already classic and politically incorrect start. They're lovers, who probably just had sex, but this is no voyeurism, this is intimacy, a necessary intimacy to feel for Marion, to understand her, to understand her motives for stealing the money in the following scene.Indeed, the way, Janet Leigh portrays Marion Crane, and Hitchcock's intimate directing, creates an incredible feeling of empathy leading to paranoia. When Marion leaves the town, we don't know where she goes exactly, but we're following her totally hooked, like hostages of her fate. When she accidentally meets her boss, we're shocked \u0085 and feel her slow descent to paranoia, from the discussion with the police offer, to the car rental service where every hint of nervousness acts like an accusation. That's the brilliance of Hitchcock's script, at that point: there's just the robbery, and Marion's troubles. We fear that she might get caught, totally unaware that this option would have saved her life.The rest is legendary; she meets Norman Bates, a young, easy-going and soft-spoken Motel manager, with nothing suspicious in his approach. He's a bit shy and awkward but this only highlights his 'boy-next-door' attitude. Of course, there's this strident voice that shouts at him every time, those stuffed birds, but when you live alone in such a little and boring place, one must find hobbies. Marion is too exhausted anyway to get suspicious and Anthony Perkins's great acting doesn't suggest the idea, even for us, that he's trying to seduce her, although, they're like forming a cute couple, and we almost expect something happening between them, until Bates reveals to be a voyeur, which shocked me as if I was so close to Marion, I felt like Bates spying on me.We all know the rest of the story, what else can be said? The shower scene is probably the most audacious and shocking plot twist ever committed on screen. It's extraordinary that the character that was driving the film was killed so early. Marion Crane wasn't a supporting character, she was the lead of the first part of the film, and the transfer from Crane to Bates as the new lead of the film is masterfully done. Especially that at this point, Norman Bates is not the official villain of the film, it's like we feel some sympathy for him as he tries to protect his evil mother. We need to feel empathy anyway.But Hitchcock had to surprise us. The film doesn't have one twist but in fact two twists including the classic, shocking revelation of the mother's identity, a shock starting with the sudden appearance of the skull, even scarier than the shadowy figure behind the curtains. This conclusion is the pay-off of a rather normal part between Marion's murder and the climax, saved by a scene-stealing performance by Martin Balsam as Detective Arbogast, a supporting but pivotal character whose annoying perseverance will indirectly solve Marion Crane's disappearance mystery. The film could have disappointed after Marion's death, the shocking revelation places it among the greatest classics.And one thing prevented the film from being perfect, and I can't understand how a director like Hitchcock let himself tolerate such amateurish writing. I'm talking of the shrink scene where during 5 minutes, the characters and the audience make one and quietly listen to Bates' biography, as a text, the screenwriter probably wrote before starting the script. It's like Hitchcock underestimated his audience's intelligence. Didn't we have enough hints? Wasn't the last scene meaningful enough to understand that he suffered from a personality disorder? Thankfully, \"Psycho\" overcame many flaws and managed to be the greatest suspense movie ever, thanks to a constant paranoid feeling, two shocking twists, a memorable villain, and an unforgettable score. \"Psycho\" is an accidental masterpiece, but it's still a masterpiece", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "An \"accidental\" masterpiece ... and the greatest suspense movie ever ...", "date": "2011-03-21T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2401890", "sentiment score": [0.0521, 0.1552, 0.195, 0.3928, 0.2049]}, {"content": "A woman escapes with a stolen envelope full of money.

These are no great actors, not in any other movies, and neither in Psycho. Then we come to the story, the part of the film I really did not like. There's simply nothing brilliant about it, it's merely a plain story. Also, it was a little too obvious, referring to the fact that Norman's mother was already dead. This should have been worked out better, just like the shower scene. OK, the idea was brilliant, but I just can't believe, even back in 1960, that people find this shocking.

Many mysteries, possibly most, have surprises waiting at the end but they rarely leave you dumbfounded. \"The Crying Game\" is one of the exceptions, however, and \"Psycho\" is the mother of them all.There isn't much point in going through the plot again, so I'll just note a few impressions that have lasted over many viewings.One is that there are a couple of usually ignored people in the crew that deserve medals. One is the production designer, who is responsible for the overall look of the picture. His work could hardly be improved upon, from the oppressively bleak landscape surrounding Janet Leigh's car when the CHP officer wakes her up, to the haunted mansion on top of the slight hill, surrounded by gardens of weeds.The other neglected contributor is the set dresser. Of course the director, the punctilious Hitchcock, decides questions of props and camera placement, but -- that soulless and bourgeois real estate office with its potted plants and its large picture of a sere landscape that perches over Janet Leigh's desk; the stuffed birds suggestive of Poe (a raven) or a menacing nocturnal predator (an owl), and the pictures of birds, juxtaposed with pictures of roly poly naked nymphs, some in the act of being violated. In Bloch's novel and in the film, the untitled book that Vera Miles examines in Perkins' little-boy bedroom is filled with pornography but it couldn't be shown on screen.The murder in the shower doesn't need to be described but I've never been able to watch this without a sinking feeling that Janet Leigh really doesn't NEED that shower at this particular point in time and space. Leigh is a fine actress. When she's driving away from Phoenix and the camera is on her face, minuscule expressions come and go across her features, reflecting the conversations she's fantasizing about. There's even a hint of a wry smile when she imagines the outrage of Cassady, the fat and self-satisfied millionaire, when he discovers that Leigh has absconded with the money he flaunted, as in -- \"Take that, you bastard.\" There's something aptly birdlike about Janet Leigh too. She's narrow shouldered and long legged, a little stork-like, as well as being just the right age. She has the desperation of a woman facing forty. Of course to a man who's spent the last ten years alone with a corpse, Leigh is an object of Paphian interest. She's old but not too old yet, just as she's a star but not too big a star to torpedo the movie when she is eliminated from it.Two shots stand out from a multitude of originals. (1) When Balsam finds Leigh's fake signature in the motel's register, the camera is looking up at Tony Perkins, who is nibbling some candy. Balsam says, \"Oh, yes. Here she is,\" and invites Perkins to examine the fake. The camera doesn't cut away but remains on Perkins' jaw as he leans over the unseen book and we watch his jaw and adam's apple working nervously away. (2) Perkins decides to move Mama from her bedroom to the fruit cellar. The camera follows him very slowly as he climbs the stairs and enters her room, but inside of going through the door, the camera rises about the transom and pivots around, an extraordinary movement, so that when Perkins exits lugging mother in his arms, we are too flabbergasted by what the camera has done to notice any discrepancy between the reality Norman has constructed for us and any reality that most of the rest of us might recognize.(3) Just to be wanton, I'll throw in that shot of Janet Leigh's dead eye. The camera first follows a pale stream of blood down INTO the bathtub drain, then dissolves to Leigh's staring iris, then draws back along the floor while deliberately righting itself from a slight tilt to the proper vertical. (Check out the remake. The camera apes the original shot but practically twirls on its axis.) Two weakness or, let's say, things I wish Hitchcock would have done a little differently. One is that car gurgling and sinking into that accommodating swamp. You only find those swamps in the movies and Louisiana. The second is that experimental scene in which Martin Balsam tumbles backward down a rear-projected staircase. The director was more proud of the mechanical difficulties behind that shot than he had a right to be.You know what occurs to me sometimes, when I'm watching this, or when I'm watching some of the garbage that now fills our screens? I wish that the people writing and directing movies like \"Saw II\" would rescreen \"Psycho\" so they could get some hint about how to make a truly horrifying movie with practically no blood, no monsters with chain saws and no teen agers screaming and running round in panties. Man, have we lost our grip, or what? And while we're at it let's have no more girls named Jillian or Megan, either. I'm tired of them. Bring back the old days when movies had little blood and girls had sensible names like Mary and Hepzibah. Oh -- and let's get rid of that hand-held electronic junk too.

However there has long been another tradition of scaring people with more worldly horrors, with the genuinely unnerving touch of wholly possible events, familiar settings and the thought that this could happen to you too. And who else would be behind one of the most seminal and iconic entries in this subgenre but Master of Suspense\u0099 Alfred Hitchcock, the director who specialised in bringing real-world terrors home to his audience.Perhaps the main secret to Psycho's success is the unusual structuring of its screenplay. The adaptation by Joseph Stefano contains more or less all the actual events of the original Robert Bloch novel, except that the emphasis has changed. The novel was told largely from Norman Bates's perspective, with Marion Crane turning up on his doorstep a few chapters in. However the adaptation brings us in to the story with Marion, telling the first half of the narrative through her eyes. This not only provides one of the biggest red herrings in the history of the thriller, it is a really effective way of keying us into the story on the level of an ordinary \"everywoman\", albeit one who has stolen a large sum of money, but even this the script goes to lengths to rationalise, embroiling us in her growing paranoia.But the screenplay would be worth little if it wasn't for the fact Hitchcock knows exactly how to present this material. He uses a lot of long takes in the scenes with Janet Leigh, using his roving camera to keep us with her, or at least with her thoughts, as for example when the camera pans down to the pile of money on the bed then over to the suitcase. Such manoeuvres can be very gimmicky and intrusive, so a director can only really get away with them if the picture is otherwise utterly compelling, which of course Psycho is. Hitch contrasts the long takes with a choppy editing pattern when Anthony Perkins is around, as suited to the awkward oddity of his presence. One of the director's finest constructions is the scene where Leigh and Perkins talk together in the parlour, surrounded by all those stuffed birds, a rather long scene, heavy on dialogue, and thus one that could easily become boring. However Hitch creates several modulations in tone simply by varying his angle. For example, when Bates is angered by Marion's suggestion that his mother be put someplace, Perkins is shown in profile, with that predatory owl prominent at the top of the screen, while the contrasting shots of Leigh become close-ups, looking vulnerable with her back to the wall.And one of the biggest keys to the realism (and therefore the ability to disturb) of Psycho is the quality of the acting performances. Janet Leigh plays a very credible game of trying to balance outward calmness and inner turmoil, which is really crucial to make the picture work. If the average audience member is to empathise with her character, we have to believe that she is not some hardened criminal, and that she is racked with guilt and fear of getting caught. Martin Balsam is great too as the easygoing private investigator, making his character likable by the naturalism of his performance. Finest of all however is of course Anthony Perkins, the genius of whose performance is the simplicity and fragility with which he plays Norman Bates, and that edge of menace he suddenly brings out of nowhere. His turn here is ideally suited to the Hitchcockian mode of suspense, as it treads that line of allowing the audience to be taken in by one red herring, but is also believable in retrospect once the truth is finally revealed.I'll finish with a quick word on the musical score for Psycho. While Bernard Hermann's \"stabbing strings\" have been cited and praised as much as virtually every other aspect of the picture, I'm also struck by the similarity between the main theme (the sharp, tense piece that plays over the opening credits and several other scenes) and the penultimate movement of the Russian composer Modeste Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. This latter piece refers to a macabre Slavic folk tale about a witch who kidnaps and murders children. Whether or not the link is deliberate, both pieces of music strike the same tone to suit their grisly and terrifying subject matter.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "\"Our private traps\"", "date": "2010-12-27T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2359139", "sentiment score": [0.0159, 0.1194, 0.3503, 0.4636, 0.0507]}, {"content": "\"Psycho\" is without a doubt a classic film a suspense thriller that ranks well in memory it impacted cinema and pop culture it's a film that ranks as iconic history. When I first saw it I was even afraid to take showers as a kid! As the famous shower scene impacted me that much, and many people even had a phobia of staying in a motel after seeing this film classic. Later thru the years after countless viewings I adjusted and saw every moment of the film as pleasure as after I learned how the shower scene was shot I learned to appreciate cinema history and the techniques of how the shower scene was shot with superior montage editing.Alfred Hitchcock the master of thriller suspense had it all in \"Psycho\" the many themes present are lust, sex, embezzlement, greed, secrets, taxidermy, voyeurism, and a split personality which caused someone to cross dress as their dead mother! Aside from that the shower shower scene is memorable one of the most famous in film history and combined with the performances of Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh, \"Psycho\" is a memorable classic that a viewer can't get enough of.Set in Arizona it begins with Marion Crane(played so beautiful and very elegantly sexy by Janet Leigh a 60's screen siren. Plus it was a real treat to see Janet undress and sport that sexy black bra!)a woman who as a lonely secretary only has a hobby of being a sexy and elegant seducer of her boyfriend a man who's divorced. And Marion wants escape so one Friday afternoon after returning from lunch break when she receives a payment for her boss from a rich oil business man an ideal is sprung to mind. Marion will leave town only the money is not put in the bank it will take a journey ride with Marion to California. Interesting and very watchful along the way is the scenes of the deep voiced policeman who follows Marion a little distance, as I think Hitchcock used these scenes to show a viewer that Ms. Crane felt guilt about her exit.Only one rainy evening in California she drives upon the lonely Bates motel and this place feels different as it's clearly not what it seems. Attending is Norman Bates(wonderfully done and over the top by Anthony Perkins) who's a strange guy a shut in who tends to his old sick mother(supposedly)and Norman has a hobby of collecting dead birds! As he talks and checks Ms. Crane in Norman seems normal, yet he's anything but. Then shocking is when Marion gets settled in she tries to unwind and chill with a hot shower, only this is one shower that will spray out a sliced up death as it will become a blood bath! As Marion will clearly have her secrets washed away in blood.Many don't know the shower scene was shot from seventy different camera positions. As the montage editing is fantastic as the way the shots were linked together showing a certain form of art. This was adapted from the Soviet Union from the classic director Eisenstein as the clashing of images is graphic as it matches the film's shower scene so well. As each clashing scene the knife is shown going back and fourth from Leigh's body the images clash with blood showing the graphic side of life as this film has a bloody form of art. And most telling and chilling is the final shot when Janet falls as the blood drips down the tub drain showing her dead the drain symbolizes her life has indeed went down the drain! Really this is one scene I can go on and on about as if you know and study film their is always something you can find that the shower scene symbolizes and links to life and a graphic form of death. The scene was just so brilliant.So did Norman do it or was it mad mother who knows as Hitchcock tries to keep it a little suspenseful. Only you the viewer know the real shock poor Norman is a dressed up guy having a thing for women's wardrobe! Overall great suspense thriller classic from Alfred it proves we all have the right to go a little mad. It proves that you can't run from and hide your secrets. And when you arrive in a strange place you never know what to expect, as hidden secrets are present and they might just be stranger than yours just even mad and crazy! \"Psycho\" is one of the best films ever made.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Hitch's best.

Alfred Hitchcock is well known for his horror films, and Psycho definitely proves why. The plot behind the movie really broke a mold for horror films during the 1960's. Movies were become more \"expressive\", and leaving less unsaid, but Psycho revealed some truths behind sex and violence that weren't discussed in society. Alfred Hitchcock helped to change what society thought of as true terror. There was a realness to his films, unlike the studio era horror films. His use of the camera was truly remarkable. It's obvious that Hitchcock knew how to add suspense and fear. His way of showing the actor's reaction then what they were looking at, makes it feel like you are in the film. Also, the famous shower scene depicts how some things are better left to the imagination. Not because it's too much for the audience to handle, but because it makes the viewer think and fill in the blanks in a way. It was obvious that the woman had been killed, but it's more frightening in a way to leave out the whole scene. It adds that gasp effect.

Even other Hitch classics I don't particularly love or hate (such as The Birds, Rear Window or Marnie) trigger a wider emotional response than the pretty simplistic shock effects which are all Psycho has to offer. Of course there's some great cinematography, but it isn't backed by any involving factors other than sheer horror, or the kind of hammy pseudo-psychology Hitchcock already tried his hand on in Spellbound.My reasonably kind rating of seven out of ten is mostly motivated by its historical importance - even if you take into account that Peeping Tom, which I think is a far superior film with a similar theme, relentlessly flopped earlier in the same year - as it opened the mainstream public's eyes regarding the horror/thriller genre.

Perkins never totally got his due as an actor. The man was brilliant, and Norman was of course his greatest achievement.One of the interesting things about Psycho now is the not-so-publicized trouble the film had on initial release. Reviews were mixed, to say the least. One British reviewer (C. A. Lejuene) actually quit her job because the movie so offended her. But it was a massive hit with the public, and then critics literally changed their minds. Different world.That Bates became such an iconic film character is no surprise. Perkins makes that happen in every shot. Norman is about as creepy a character as you can find. Despite being a murderer, he's no killer. He's an extremely nervous, anti-social, near-shell of a man so mentally and morally corrupted and broken that it's hard to imagine him doing anything else with his life. He waits at his dingy motel for the rare occupant. Surely, he doesn't have much at all to do with most of them. It's the ones who want to talk to him that find trouble, as he's incapable of interacting peacefully.There is a shame to Norman. He is constantly embarrassed by his own perceived shortcomings, despite being a tall, good-looking man. Given that everyone and their mother has seen and discussed this film, we know the reason for his eternal agony with himself, but just in case someone stumbles upon this and has not seen Psycho or doesn't know the ending, I'll avoid going into it, because I'd hate to be the person who ruins this movie.I saw this movie first when I was eight years old. It thrilled me, and that is really the only time I've ever been truly and completely detached and sucked into a film's world. I am not saying this is the greatest film of all-time (it would be up there on my personal list, in part because of my attachment to it), but I was born 22 years after this movie was released. A lot changes culturally in 30 years, especially when the start of that was in 1960. Since I was just a kid and movies from 1960 weren't exactly lunch line talk, I didn't know anything at all about Psycho. It just happened to be on TV, and I fell in love with it. It was gripping, I probably had the sense that it was beyond me (or however you'd put that at eight), and Perkins' performance mesmerized me. I'd never seen anything like that. I started watching non-kids movies and TV a lot earlier than a lot of folks did, because supervision of TV was never a big thing for my family. It was just assumed that if I saw a bad guy kill a broad, I would have the common sense instilled in me to not go out and do that myself. But I'd never seen anything like Norman Bates.And really, I still haven't.This is a film people will still be watching in another 50 years. The revelations and twists have become less shocking as time has passed, because so many movies have gone down similar roads, but Psycho has its own tone and that performance from Perkins that keeps it elevated among the best.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Psycho", "date": "2010-10-03T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2319168", "sentiment score": [0.1553, 0.3695, 0.2412, 0.1639, 0.0702]}, {"content": "By today's standards, the murder scenes are laughable, but I know that back in 1960, this movie was terrifying.Alfred Hitchcock is definitely a master.

Even in some scenes where nothing was happen, that music came on and I was scared. I was grabbing onto my friend and biting my fingers. The night after I watched this, I had to lock my door, check my bathroom for a hidden creep, and think of happy things until I fell asleep. It left a lasting impression on me, definitely.

I'm not that familiar with the cinema of The Master of Suspense, though.In 1960 colored films were already quite common (even Hitchcock's own films) but 'Psycho' was filmed in black and white. One can only wonder why, but I don't care about that. I'm not saying this just because I consider black and white a form of art but also because 'Psycho' is the kind of film that works better in black and white. It probably would be bad if it was in colors. The same way I wouldn't want black and white films such as 'The Window' (by Ted Tetzlaff) in colors, among others. 'Psycho', while I don't see it as the masterpiece many made it seem to be, is an okay movie. The old-fashioned feeling it gives is nice: the opening scene showing a lovely panorama of Phoenix, Arizona (where it takes place); the huge American cars of that time; the fact that it is in black and white; etc.The famous shower scene doesn't look minimally realistic. I'm not gonna spoil my reasons, but it's so phony that it's obvious how it was made. Nevertheless, I think it is well made (if that makes sense) and it certainly is effective when it comes to quickness, although not really scary... well, at least not for our standards. But it must have been so surprising in 1960. For me, the part when the same assassin kills detective Arbogast is scarier, as that scene is so sudden and when you less expect... not to mention that it is very quick!The violin sound makes a great piece of music and works well for the suspense of this film, which has many well made scenes of solid suspense. Scenes which give the feeling that you don't know what's gonna happen, but give the idea that something bad might happen. That's the case, for example, of a sequence when Marion is driving her car on a dark rainy night and the wipers of her car barely clean any rain. We barely see anything, just like her.This is a movie that, watching for a 1st time, it's almost impossible to guess that Norman's \"mother\" is actually Norman himself disguised and imitating her. But it's easy to suspect that he's not the innocent guy he seems to be at first, as he smiles of satisfaction when he sinks Marion's car on a swamp (with her body in the car's trunk).Although interesting, it's a weird movie. I hear that weird movies was one of Hitchcock's specialties. Janet Leigh does a fine job as Marion Crane. Other actors do well either. Bernard Herrmann's soundtrack is fantastic.The final shot, which shows Marion's car being recovered from the swamp, could have been longer. It's far too quick and ends too sudden.

On her way to see her fianc\u00e9, she finds herself at the desolate Bates Motel, whose owner turns out to be the namesake for the title of the film: a psycho. After obsessing about his dead mother for so long, he psychologically turned into her persona at times. The women Norman Bates kills, were killed when his mother's persona was in charge.The main characters are Norman Bates, and Marion Crane, portrayed by Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh, respectively.The overall theme of this movie seems to deal with the uncertainty of unfamiliar people. When Marion, the main character, happens to meet the socially-awkward Norman Bates, she probably couldn't have imagined getting murdered by him. The message seems to be that you can never really know if the next person you meet is truly crazy.A movie with a similar theme is Hitchhiker, in which a person driving across the country picks up a hitchhiker, who ultimately does many sadistic things to the driver. In that movie, it was also clear that you just don't know which strangers to trust.Perhaps the most famous scene in Psycho is the one in which Marion is stabbed to death in the shower, frequently referred to as the \"shower scene\", in pop culture. This scene is shot and pieced together with many short clips, all shot at different angles. The constant views at different angles make the scene more suspenseful and frightening, in my opinion. Although the attacker in the scene remains obscure, it appears to be that of a woman. Ultimately, it is revealed that Norman also dresses as \"Mother\", whenever he thinks he is \"Mother\".Another scene that best exemplifies how crazy Norman is, is the final scene, in which he's locked up in a prison cell. \"Mother\" is thinking that everyone has it wrong \u2013 he wouldn't even hurt a fly! The camera closes in upon him as \"Mother's\" thoughts are narrated. And in the close-up of Norman, an eerie feeling is truly conveyed.When this film was first released, I think it was a first of its kind in some aspects. I think that never before, a murder had been so graphic in a movie. Although, compared to some modern movies (such as Saw), Psycho would be considered a very mild murder film.But in any case, I believe the film was cutting-edge for the day, and remains a classic tribute to a man who truly was \"Psycho\".", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Super Thriller!", "date": "2010-08-11T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2293869", "sentiment score": [0.0126, 0.0729, 0.3287, 0.505, 0.0807]}, {"content": "I have seen just one other Hitchcock movie before this one, and this review is from the point of view of a relative beginner.

Most of the 21st-century horror flicks concentrate solely on 'scaring' the viewer, and don't give two-hoots about the story (or rather the lack of it), and performances from the so-called 'actors'.

Not to forget the cunning Marion Crane, played by Janet Leigh.The second (and probably the most important) thing that struck me was the brilliant camera-work and sound-effects. The \"film\" experience this movie generated (even if you watch it at home on the computer) was something I hadn't experienced in a long time.

My previous encounters consisted of a few dozen snickers to my viewing partner about how the film was ridiculously unrealistic and could never happen, and that furthermore, it wasn't really scary because I knew what was coming. This leads to my main problem with the genre: I am an expert at discerning the plot climax well before it happens. This is a massive problem, because it takes away the suspense.Just a heads up, I will not be spoiling anything here, I'll just describe the setting and characters. Nothing story orientated. Anyway, so imagine my surprise when I finally decided to jump into the last of the main four Hitchcock films: Psycho.The film differentiates itself from Rear Window (1954) in more ways that one. Namely; its been filmed in black & white, the setting is purposely lower class and it focuses even more on the psychological rather than the physical. The villain might not have the razor sharp fingers of Freddy Kruger, or the deep seeded hatred of Jigsaw, but he/she is made infinitely more malevolent through the twists and turns conveyed by the director. What makes this villain so much scarier than all the rest? He or she's an inherently plausible evildoer; one who could be sitting right next to you while you watch the film for all you know. The horror of Hitchcock's masterpiece is that it forces you to question whether this could happen to you.The filmography might not be as good as Vertigo (1958), but it's certainly up there, and easily the defining work of the genre. It seems somewhat like Sin City in it's technical codes, the director obviously had the capacity to use color, but he chose to use black & white, why is that I wonder? The lack of color (and the associated filmic codes) isn't a drawback, it's done to keep you ignorant of the horrors to come. In many ways 'Psycho' feels like a last tribute to the genre, but in reality it's simply a new beginning, like Clint Eastwood's 1993 epic 'Unforgiven' was for the Western genre.Hitchcock makes you believe you ARE one of the protagonists. His use of lighting is fantastic: dark scenes preclude a twist, and every time he shows one you tremble in fear, and try to figure out what's going to happen. There's no point. The film is crafted so eloquently that the vast majority of people won't figure it out until well into it, at which point you're not annoyed that you've figured out the main plot element, but rather you become much more involved.This is a masterpiece, and 'Psycho' is one of the few films that'll have you telling yourself that over and over again while you watch it.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Quite simply the greatest horror ever made", "date": "2010-06-02T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2258560", "sentiment score": [0.0889, 0.3825, 0.2947, 0.1988, 0.0351]}, {"content": "I challenge you to think of a more influential movie than Alfred Hitchcock's psycho. Such a movie does not exist.Psycho created its own genre: Sure, there were monster, killer, and \"horror\" movies prior to 1960, but Psycho is the first actually good one. All pre-Psycho films are merely proto-horror movies. People still watch Psycho and, importantly, they still watch it as a horror movie. When people watch Frankenstein or Dracula, they are watching it for A) a laugh, or B) because it's famous. While Dracula and Frankenstein might sell in cheap monster movie box sets, Psycho still sells as a movie on its own, and to a wide and diverse audience that includes kids, adults, cinema lovers, and nacho lovers. No need to mention that every horror movie since Psycho is inspired by Psycho. This brings us to the next point...Psycho is still a little bit scary: At its release, this movie had people screaming and throwing up. This does not happen anymore, but VERY few movies can legitimately scare people for more than a few years after they're released. I'm not claiming that Psycho is still legitimately scary, but compare it to more recent horror movies such as Halloween or Nightmare on Elm Street. Those movies are also no longer scary, and Psycho is in fact (in my opinion) scarier to a modern audience. Thus, it has stood the test of time as well as one could hope.The music: you all know it, your grandma knows it, and your 4-year old knows it. How many movies have stolen this score almost note for note?One last thing. Critics everywhere regard Psycho as a masterpiece, but often include a little clause about the psychiatrist scene and how it's out of place. I'll admit that when I first watched the movie, I was petrified when the psychiatrist started his speech because I, too, thought that this would be the undoing of a would-be masterpiece. However, my fears were not realized. Every time I've watched the movie since, I actually enjoy this scene and I don't feel the need to justify it by saying, \"Oh, people back then needed this kind of scene to make sense of the movie and it's just dated now.\" No, I can 100% truthfully say that I think the scene adds to the movie, and I consider myself brutally honest when it comes to Hitchcock movies, even though I am a fan. I feel that Vertigo, Shadow of a Doubt, and Notorious are all overrated and have problems, but not Psycho.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "THE Most Influential Movie of All Time", "date": "2010-05-31T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2257663", "sentiment score": [0.1471, 0.1931, 0.1477, 0.2594, 0.2527]}, {"content": "\"Psycho\" is unquestionably one of the finest films of all time, and probably the greatest thriller (although there are several other contenders, all directed by Hitchcock). The acting is first-rate; the cinematography is superb; and the musical score (by Bernard Herrmann) is iconic. (Incredibly, the score did not receive an Oscar nomination.) Hitchcock has been deservedly praised for his direction, but I feel it is time to give credit where credit is due. I recently read the book on which the movie was based, also titled \"Psycho\". It was written by Robert Bloch in 1959, a year before the movie was made. Except for two scenes that weren't in the book, and a couple of memorable lines (most notably, \"Well, a boy's best friend is his mother\"), the movie follows the book so closely that almost all of the credit should go to the author of the book, not the director of the movie. If you have seen and enjoyed the movie, pick up a copy of the book. Only then can you appreciate who the real genius was behind \"Psycho\".There are quite a few, mostly minor, differences between the book and movie. As I read the book, I wondered why the changes had been made. Here are some examples. In the movie, Ms. Crane's name is Marion; in the book, it is Mary. In the movie, she lives and works in Phoenix, Arizona; in the book, she is from Ft. Worth, Texas. In the movie, Norman Bates is thin and young; in the book, he is fat and middle-aged. In the book, he wears glasses; in the movie, he doesn't. In the movie, there are twelve cabins at the motel; in the book, there are six. I found no fewer than thirty-five differences, but almost none of them made any sense to me.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Iconic film", "date": "2010-05-27T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2255903", "sentiment score": [0.0096, 0.0363, 0.0849, 0.476, 0.3932]}, {"content": "At the age of 60, Alfred Hitchcock decided to go wildly radical after his award-winning big productions. His next film, Psycho (1960), was an independent production whose budget was only 800 000 dollars. Through this Hitchcock was able to make a film, entirely in a way he wanted to but also achieve a naturally mundane atmosphere which was still characterized by psychological and film noir-like elements. Psycho is still Hitchcock's most shocking film and the most influential film he ever made. Just like The Beatles, the death of Elvis and the assassination of John F. Kennedy, so is Psycho a part of the cultural legacy of the 1960's. It marked a turning point in the history of American cinema and changed its being forever: reality was now approached in a brand new way, through a Hitchcockian prism of fear. In the central of Psycho there is a run-down motel which has been left to the side of a new highway: a picture of alienation, a system which progresses quickly, neglecting the actual needs of people. The motel is run by an extraordinary man, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who lives alone with his mother. One day Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a woman who has just stolen 40, 000 dollars, arrives to the Bates' Motel. Having disappeared, Marion's boyfriend and sister start to look for her. But Norman isn't too happy about it and tries to avoid their investigation.Like in many films by Alfred Hitchcock, the opening credits of Psycho are extremely important and fascinating. These opening credits were designed by the storyboard artist and pictorial consultant Saul Bass, who had also designed them for The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956). The credits, together with the score by Bernard Herrmann, manage to set out the theme and the topic of the film. The credits are often seen to illustrate the decomposition of the human mind but also the change of order and disorder which is common for capitalist urban life. It is an expression of the \"new\" world order.The graphics designed by Bass don't just reign the opening credits: they're everywhere in the film. In the beginning, we see the horizontal Janet Leigh and her brassiere, and the vertical John Gavin, completely topless. The geometric polarity of horizontal and vertical lines repeats in concrete forms throughout Psycho: for example, the horizontal motel and the vertical Victorian mansion in which Norman's mother lives.Psycho is mundane, or as Michael Schmidt has said \"Psycho combines wonderfully the everyday and mysterious.\" But it really isn't a b-movie. For Hitchcock the horror and excitement just happen to arise from ordinary, mundane things. Once again, the opening scene is a wonderful example of this: just a conventional, simple scene. Back then, the audience was affected by Janet Leigh's breasts and brassiere which were shown for the first time in the history of cinema but, what is more, the scene is so well filmed that the viewer can do nothing but get identified with the characters. Psycho indeed might just be the most polished thriller ever made. It's perfect, no matter how you look at it.Psycho puts the society to a collision between the shadows of past and presence. It conducted dialog between the old past and trendy presence. In the film, we meet two modern urban clich\u00e9s: a regular office girl and a lonely youngster who also spends most of his time at his office. There is one intriguing scene which is a wonderful example of this: an unconventional love scene between two loners which, in turn, conducts dialog with the opening scene: now the characters don't talk about money and sex but about loneliness.The way I see it, if Psycho has got a thesis, it must be that fear is in ourselves. Marion is constantly put in scenes with mirrors: first in the office, then in the motel etc. The most luminous proof of the nature of this thesis is in the scene where Marion's sister (Vera Miles) scares her own reflection on a mirror -- a brilliant shot which soon became a clich\u00e9.In Psycho money isn't really essential. Money is present, all the time, but it doesn't make a difference -- it is insignificant. Hitchcock obviously wanted to show money just as a part of the society. It is a part of the air we breathe, so to speak. However, Psycho does also talk more widely about consumer society. A good example of the consumer culture is the scene where Marion quickly changes her old car to a new one. Even if her motive was to get away from the cops, the scene doesn't just talk about her personal hurry but about the social hurry inside us all. Psycho talks about the American society and about the transition, in the 1950's: how it turned from the conservative to more and more liberal in the 1960's but at the same became more alienated and anguished.I'm sure I could go on and on about Psycho but, unfortunately, there are limitations. To put it briefly, Psycho is one of the best American films ever made and its aesthetic, cultural and sociological influence is undeniable. Many have spent thousands of words just talking about the architecture of Psycho: how the mansion represents the Freudian psychic apparatus (id, ego and superego) and how much influence Hitchcock took from an American painter Edward Hopper (take a look at The House by the Railroad). Together with Michael Powell's Peeping Tom (1960), Hitchcock's Psycho opened the gates for the graphically clear treatment for violence. However, it is much more of a film about our world than violence. Psycho is all about an example of voyeurism and alienation but, in reality, the criticism hits the whole perverted culture and society. Its mundane, Freudian horror is straight from this world and those who criticize it for being horrible, actually criticize their own existence and twisted world.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Mundane Freudian Horror from This World", "date": "2010-05-19T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2252154", "sentiment score": [0.0067, 0.0417, 0.1231, 0.5826, 0.2459]}, {"content": "So I finally watched Psycho, what many consider the best horror film of all time.

Janet Leigh is bank employee Marion Crane, who has let temptation get the better of her and absconded with $40,000.

Hitchcock's finest achievement with Psycho is undoubtedly fooling his audience into assuming that Leigh is the central character and then suddenly bumping her off, metaphorically pulling the rug from under the viewers feet; but he also manages many other brilliant touches, including Marion Crane's tense flight from Phoenix, where she imagines how events are unfolding at the bank, Norman's disposal of Ms Crane's car in a swamp (with her body in the boot), a moment of wonderful dark humour as the vehicle momentarily refuses to sink, and of course, the macabre ending in which Lila discovers Norman's mother hiding in the fruit cellar.Add a cool title sequence by Saul Bass and a fantastic score by Bernard Hermann, itself often imitated, and what you have is a bona fide classic of the horror genre (yes, horror) that any self respecting fan should ensure that they see at least several times.

Milton Arbogast as the private detective, I wanted him to leave Bates alone as Norman was such an understandable character. Hitchcock delivers horror in a movie which has no gore. I never thought this old movie could be this awesome. I mean, the score was chilling and its still used today with all kinds of variations. This is the one of the films which spawned every horror filmmaker out there to follow the footsteps of Hitchcock and be as great as him (unfortunately, there are only a few).Words don't do justice to this movie. Hitchcock does not disappoint by leaving out his trademark dark humor. He is brilliant by making the climax so scary. I really didn't see the ending coming. It was sheer brilliance on the part of Hitchcock. We still got films that have the same theme recycled over and over again. But, nothing is as good as the original. As they say, \"old is gold\" (I never thought I would say that). Hitchcock's decision to make this in black and white is impressive as it is more scary without the colours.Do yourselves a favour and make your kids watch this film before they can get brainwashed into thinking today's horror films are scary. The smile at the end by Norman Bates (I'm so awestruck and scared by it) - so creepy.

Very light and crystal clear. The film has a straight forward plot structure. The film draws you in. It keeps you interested. First you are following the plot of a lady who has stolen money and on the run. Then she gets killed and you completely forget about her, now you are forces on this creepy hotel and weird owner. The first murder scene is done so well. The woman is in the shower she doesn't notice but the audiences can her, Norman's mother's shadow. You don't see the mothers face but you see her stab. You never see the knife actual stab the girl. This scene I felt was tastefully done. You know that girls gets stab by Normans mother not by seeing her pierce the skin but by the motion of the knife that is shown and the girls lifeless body in a pool of blood. I love how the camera tied the nest scene in by going to the shower drain. Then moves out slowly from her eye, then to the unknown hidden money to a shocked Norman cleaning up his mother's murder. Though the movie you develop pity for poor Norman. He is a kind genuine man. You think he would never hurt a fly. His seems nice and charming a little bit on the weird side. He stuff birds but makes it weird is how much he enjoys it. You feel bad for him because it seems he is trapped by his mother. That she has turned him into a mama's boy. At the end you're in for a crazy twist. Though out the movie the suspense builds up, you can wait to see this bitch. But then you are surprise when you see the mother and who she really is. I never would have guess. I thought that the film was brilliantly done. How the mothers face in never relived till the end. Or why you could only her mother when she is having a conversation with her son when you don't see them. But in the end you understand why and how the film got its name.

None of these emit the intensity so easily shown in Hitchcock's Psycho. There has even been a remake, a travesty to the original.

Before that, horror movies featured monsters and mythical creatures, and monster movie was synonymous with horror movie. This all changed in 1960 with the release of this movie and the inferior, controversial, career-destroying Peeping Tom. These movies showed the worst kind of monster: a human being.The plot follows that Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) embezzles money for herself and her boyfriend, Sam Loomis (John Gavin). She stays overnight at the Bates Motel, run by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). It's not a surprise to anyone that Norman Bates is the villain of the movie. That is one of the primary problems with this movie: Norman is the only likable character in the entire movie. He's handsome, but shy and misunderstood, so he can't have a relationship outside of his voyeuristic fantasy life. This is a grave contrast to Marion Crane, a sleazy, immoral character.All is going well to this point; it looks like it might get interesting, but starting with Marion's murder, it takes a 180. Her murder is one of the worst (not most brutal) I've ever seen. While the killer is supposed to be stabbing her to death, the camera jerks all over the place. Epileptics should definitely skip this part. John Carpenter did a far better, less obvious obscuring of graphic murders 18 years later in his Halloween.The movie then goes from bad to worse, as we observe some of the going ons in a small town, with Sam and Marion's sister, Lila (Vera Miles). Here is where it gets really boring, showing us inconsequential pieces of small-town life. Unlike Halloween, which was based on the introduction of a madman into the everyday life of babysitters, Psycho's second half is little more than filler. There is essentially no connection between the first half and the second or between the second half and the first. It just meanders for a half hour or so.The climax really comes out of nowhere.

The music always fits the scenes throughout the film however, my favorite was probably the shower scene. There were pretty good effects in the movie as well like the rain scenes for example. I thought Janet Leigh was amazing; everything from her body gestures (for example the movement of her hands when she was originally driving and being followed by a car showing her nervousness) and just her overall sense of panic (when she's at the car dealership and is being watched by the cop). I really enjoyed the sound as well, especially in Marion's car ride after she changes cars and you can hear the voices of people the cop is questioning, etc. The film is incredibly suspenseful especially in the car ride when it starts to rain and she can't see anymore; you're on the edge of your seat wondering what's going to happen. The shower scene is an absolute classic. It's so real yet at the same time so fake, you never even see her getting stabbed and the lack of blood was a little unrealistic. I felt like the only other two scenes that lacked some realism was the staircase scene, and the fact that there was conveniently a swamp right across the motel for Norman to dispose of cars and bodies. The lighting in the film was also really good with a balance of light and dark scenes. Overall, the movie is pretty good and it has its twists and is a little creepy and scary at times.

The infamous shower scene is without doubt one of the most terrifying murder scenes in any film. When I first saw that scene on the 100 Greatest American Films, I was so terrified and I admit it I have never recovered. I had a similar experience watching the Disney film Sleeping Beauty with Maleficent enticing Aurora to the spinning wheel, and Mrs Gulch turning into the Wicked Witch in the Wizard of Oz.The shower scene isn't the only effective or chilling scene in the film- in the events leading up to that scene I was biting my nails. The scene with the old woman in the chair also made me jump out of my skin. The whole of Psycho is terrifying, suspenseful and shocking. Two elements made this so. One was Hitchock's direction. The great director proves how truly great he is by directing Psycho in a masterful way, and manages to deliver the shocks when needed. The other is Bernard Hermann's music. What a creepy score! I loved his score for Vertigo and Miklos Rozsa's for Spellbound, but the high violin motif in the shower scene is the main reason why that scene in particular is so effective. I admit it, when I hear that motif, I start screaming. There is just something about it that makes your blood run cold.Other pros are a good plot, a well constructed screenplay and beautiful black and white cinematography that is perfect in conveying the creepy mood. And the ending did surprise me. The acting though was exemplary, with Janet Leigh giving one of the deservedly most memorable female performances in a Hitchcock movie, and Vera Miles also giving a stellar performance. Stealing the film is Antony Perkins as Norman Bates, he didn't just play creepy, he WAS creepy, his face, his voice, his mannerisms.. in short it is one of the most chilling performances of all time.

But with such influence it has made, you'd think the genuine article has lost its touch. That ain't so. Seeing PSYCHO today, the classic still retains its ability to shock on a first time viewing and to give you the creeps even if you've seen it twice or more times.We all know its influence in the several generations of slasher movies, but what still places PSYCHO is that it's less like the horror films it inspired than another thriller masterwork from Alfred Hitchcock; it's a well-crafted and intelligently written thriller, a quality that has slowly lessened in many of the slashers that have followed. Who could forget Janet Leigh in her performance that would make her famous in horror filmdom (and earn her an Oscar nomination) as the doomed Marion Crane. But any conversation about PSYCHO wouldn't be complete without the mention of Anthony Perkins superb performance as the infamous Norman Bates, a slightly maladjusted owner of the desolate Bates Motel. Perhaps the guys at the Oscar's were simply shocked and shivered by his chilling portrayal to give him the Oscar nomination he most certainly deserved. The supporting performances, especially by Vera Miles, are strong enough to carry the rest of the picture.Everything seemed to be pitch perfect about PSYCHO: As usual, Bernard Herrmann teams with Hitch and provides a chilling score that will forever etched in our memories. The infamous shower scene, while no longer as shocking, is still one of the most expertly crafted sequence ever made; it's use of montage is still being scrutinized and studied by any film student today. George Milo, Robert Clatworth and Joseph Hurley's art direction is superb, from Norman's office parlor inhabited by stuffed birds to the famous Bates residence (complete with a silhouette of Mother in the window) is legendary and relevant to the many goings-on at the mysterious Bates Motel. The black-and-white photography does more than just make the censor approve the film, it also suites the film's ample atmosphere (blood in B&W is creepier than color).

Where Shyamalan's movies are simply dreadful, half-assed, slow and contain hilariously bad scripts, Hitchcock remains the master no matter what year you watch his films.

I personally wasn't around in 1960, but I'm sure this caused quite a stir with its graphic scenes (by today's standard, this is PG) but I'm glad they didn't just go for the gore.

His movies and his passion for the crime of murder cemented into our collective consciousness images of terror and panic that even people who have never seen his movies can identify and pick out. Hitchcock made a stream of remarkable films over the course of his legendary career including the thrill ride \"Rear Window\" (1954) and his ultimate psychological masterpiece \"Vertigo\" (1958), but the film everybody remembers and relates to when discussing Hitchcock is his notorious 1960 box office smash \"Psycho\" and the scene everybody remembers is the one that made many people, including one of its performers, Janet Leigh, think twice before taking a shower again.\"Psycho\", adapted from a novel by Robert Bloch, is the classic story of a woman from Phoenix (Janet Leigh) who in order to marry her financially-stressed lover (John Gavin), embezzles $40,000 dollars from her employer's client and finds herself on the run, fearing and panicking every face that looks in her direction. During her flee more or less from her morals, she checks into a desolate motel run by a handsome but strange young man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). What follows is the film's infamous \"shower scene\" and a long chain of thrills, frights, and terrifying images that people, to this very day, never forget.A film can be viewed as a true work of art when it has the same effect on an audience as it did nearly half a decade again. It has been forty-nine years since \"Psycho\" was first released and to this day, it still terrifies and appalls people very much like it did in 1960. To some, such as Walt Disney himself, \"Psycho\" is just too much. It's really the \"The Silence of the Lambs\" (1991) of its day. But to those who can appreciate art and storytelling, this is a motion picture that simply cannot be refused repeated viewings.The pivotal performance of the film is, without a doubt, Norman Bates by Anthony Perkins. The acting by Perkins is so iconic and so creepy and so off-putting that he really set the standards for slasher villains and frightening characters. It is so ironic that an actor so harmless-looking, so timid-sounding as Perkins could, in an instant, turn himself into the image of a sick, bloodthirsty psychopathic monster. He can become creepy without apparently even making an effort, as though he were in real life as deranged as his character. Perkins' Norman Bates is like the Charles Foster Kane of horror movies. He's been mimicked, but never matched or overpowered. The only real contender for a match is Hannibal Lecter by Anthony Hopkins. Whoever is creepier is up to you, but it's nevertheless a very close match.\"Psycho\" is not a film that is about character development, but it doesn't need to be. In fact, extreme character development would get in the way. Norman Bates is strongly developed, but the other characters are established exceedingly well and then play from that point on. Janet Leigh, in particular, who takes up the first third of the movie almost entirely by herself, gives a great performance even though her character is very simple. Hitchcock used Leigh as a personification of the human fears and sins: guilt, panic, fear, envy, and lust. The film also features a well-cast Martin Balsam as a private investigator who tends to, like Hitchcock felt about some of his producers, get in the way too often without understanding fully what or whom he's dealing with.And of course, we can't leave out the thrills of the movie. Hitchcock used his techniques of shock, horror, and suspense to their fullest in this film. He uses the two main horror procedures: alerting an audience of an impending threat without telling the character or simply having the scare jump out and \"render you speechless\" as some of the ads for \"Psycho\" claimed the movie would do. And there is certainly more than just the infamous shower scene. It's not just the brutal killings. Again, there's Anthony Perkins in the landmark role of his career, and the black-and-white photography is notably far more effective than if Hitchcock had decided to shoot the movie in color (look at the dismal 1998 shot-by-shot remake for proof) and of course there's Bernard Herrmann's iconic all-string music score that rivets and lunges out at you.Although it is an intensely frightening film and ends with one of the creepiest final lines of all time, \"Psycho\" is so much more than just a horror story. Apart from the dawn of the slasher genre and a montage of spine-tingling images, it is a work of art done by one of the true geniuses of the cinema: Alfred Hitchcock. And while I don't feel this is his all-time best motion picture, it's certainly his most famous and deservedly so.

I guess my excuse is that I'm only 23, and most of the so-called \"classic\" movies of the 20th century were made well before I was even born. I'm ashamed to say that I fell in love with both \"Jaws\" (1975) and \"Halloween\" (1978) just last year; this year, just about a half-hour ago, I had the great pleasure to see Alfred Hitchcock's classic 1960 suspense-thriller \"Psycho.\"A lot has already been said about this film, so I won't comment too much on what it's actually about, and instead I'll only comment on significance and my reactions to it. \"Psycho\" has a plot based heavily in reality: adapted from the novel of the same name by Robert Bloch, the book and film were loosely based on the crimes of real-life Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein. \"Psycho\" finds its story revolving around Marion Crane (the late Janet Leigh), a lowly Phoenix, Arizona, secretary who embezzles $40,000 from her boss and hits the road, later stopping in at the isolated Bates Motel, and meets the owner and sole employee of the establishment, Norman Bates (the late Anthony Perkins).The rest of the plot is well-known to anyone who has seen the film, so I won't describe it. Plus, to really describe the rest of the plot in any sort of detail at all will ruin the shocks and surprises that the film has in store for the viewer (most notoriously, the infamous \"shower scene,\" which has to be seen to be believed, and experienced). The \"shower scene\" itself is one of the chief reasons to see this picture; it's shocking, Bernard Herrmann's theme slices away at your eardrums, and it's one of the iconic death scenes - one of the most iconic scenes, period - in movie history.\"Psycho\" is a phenomenal piece of film, from a master filmmaker and an equally talented cast and crew; it's a true cinematic landmark. Most importantly, and the reason why I now hold this film to the high degree that I do now, is that \"Psycho\" is partially (or is it entirely?) responsible for influencing entire generations of filmmakers, particularly those in the horror genre. \"Psycho\" has almost single-handedly influenced, and given rise to, the slasher sub-genre of horror, which of course gave rise to, and is populated by the likes of, Leatherface (from \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" series), Michael Myers (from the \"Halloween\" series), Jason Voorhees (from the \"Friday the 13th\" series), my personal favorite movie slasher Fred Krueger (from the \"Nightmare on Elm Street\" series), and countless other imitators. \"Psycho\" would itself become fodder for the slasher genre nearly two decades after its release, when it was followed up by three vastly inferior sequels, with Anthony Perkins reprising his signature role as Norman Bates in all three films.\"Psycho\" has also been the subject of a lot of psychiatric and psychological analysis, for those interested in understanding the criminal mind and how it functions. As a criminal justice major in college, in my studies I've across several opportunities to study \"Psycho\" (but never did) and exactly how it influenced the slasher genre and why it's fascinated criminology experts in the decades since its release, thus having even greater influence outside of the film community and American pop culture.Alfred Hitchcock proved that he was a cinematic genius with \"Psycho,\" since I understand that it is arguably his best and most popular film.

It is a very intelligent thriller and keeps the viewer engaged and enthralled until the last frame.The plot revolves around a highway motel and it's caretaker and owner Norman Bates, his sick and somewhat spooky mother, a woman who steals large amount of money from her employer to improve her love life with her boyfriend and who comes to stay at this Bates motel . The proceedings that follow are extremely interesting and enthralls the viewer. We get to see perhaps one of the best murder scenes ever shot in cinematic history, the famous shower murder of the lady who stays in the motel . The protagonist of the movie Norman Bates character has been very well written and performed by the actor concerned as well. Sometimes we as an audience feel pity and sorry for him and after knowing his mental condition, this feeling increases even more.In short, Psycho is one of the milestones of this particular thriller genre. Many thriller movies either based on this or influenced by this have come in many large numbers, but the charm and the greatness of this particular movie will remain in the minds of cinema lovers for eternity.Rating : 9/10", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "A Milestone in the Thriller Genre", "date": "2009-06-16T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2082000", "sentiment score": [0.008, 0.0154, 0.0651, 0.4713, 0.4402]}, {"content": "Going into the Alfred Hitchcock masterpiece \"Psycho,\" it's best that you know nothing -- in fact Hitchcock wanted it that way -- so this review will be devoid of any synopsis beyond that of the basic plot summaries given on IMDb. But truth is, the plot is only half the film's genius. The rest belongs to the master of murder and suspense.\"Psycho\" thrives on suspense. Without the constant feeling of paranoia from Hitchcock's careful camera movements or from Bernard Herrmann's vigorous string quartet, many parts of the film would feel long. At this point in his career, Hitchcock was so commanding of his craft that he achieves the desired effect from his audience with nearly every shot, whether it's wanting us to focus on particular items or make specific assumptions about the mystery at hand.Perhaps the most understated element of the film is Joseph Stefano's screenplay. From what I gather about Robert Bloch's novel, Stefano restructured the story to set up a jarring shift in the plot and encase the mystery in an even thicker container for Hitchcock to best utilize his skills. The scripts only major weakness is the scene right after the climax, which is pointless exposition explaining the previous events; something movie watchers don't need today -- though that's arguably because Hitchcock made this movie.For those that love Hitchcock's style, \"Psycho\" is an instant classic and perhaps no film of his showcases it better. For those unfamiliar with his work, it's not hard to see while watching \"Psycho\" what made his films so memorable. Even those who don't have an eye for good film-making can even appreciate the entertaining suspense and constantly twisting plot of \"Psycho.\"", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "The mother of all horror films", "date": "2009-06-16T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2081901", "sentiment score": [0.0382, 0.1403, 0.2255, 0.4321, 0.1638]}, {"content": "Anyone ever notice Perkins' bird-like performance?

This is a mystery thriller, the first part being thriller and the second being mystery.One of the elements that make this a timeless piece of cinema is the way Hitchcock sets up the back story to the character of Marion Crane and the relationship between her and Norman Bates. From the moment these stories begin, we start to get involved without knowing that Hitchcock is toying with us. I cannot ruin any spoilers, since this is a film to enjoy the first time and then maybe a second time. But, it is important to know that even though this has influenced practically every horror movie since, it is nothing like any of them. Hitchcock shot in black and white to not appear gory and used old-school tricks like music and editing to create images in our mind much scarier than on the screen.Speaking of music, has there ever been a more perfect score written for a film since this masterful work by Bernard Herrmann? In every scene it is used, it underlies the drama and increases the suspense in a way no modern director could ever do with blood and grotesque imagery.The cast is wonderful, especially Janet Leigh as Marion and Anthony Perkins as Norman. As good as Leigh is in bringing us to her side, Perkins gives arguably one of the greatest performances in all of cinema. The little details, the stuttering, the twitching, the eyes moving all around go unnoticed the first few times. Then, after awhile you notice it and see that he almost completely makes us sympathize with this character. If you've seen this before, you know what an incredible job it is, although it is a shame Perkins never got out from under Bates' shadow. What is even worse is that they made three sequels to this movie, focusing more on Norman and the violence that I am sure ensued.

Hitchcock's 1960 film Psycho is one of those such films, a film that put paid to an entire era and mindset in American cinema; a film that defied grammar and construction and went all out in its deconstruction of both genre and issues of censorship. A film made by a man usually uttered within the same breath as both Kubrick and Welles when it comes to the film-makers that shaped cinema in its first full century as an existing medium. Most will say Psycho is Hitchcock at his best, and you'd be hard pressed to disagree with them.Essentially, Psycho is a film that covers a fair degree of psychoanalysis going on within a close knit locale. The majority of the film is dominated by a certain Norman Bates (Perkins), a young man whose mother still has a grip on him as he attempts to live whatever pitiful existence he has. Bates will predominantly inhabit one of either two spaces, briefly breaking off to inhabit a rural, swamp locale for the dumping of a car. The predominant two are a cabin, complete with motel rooms and an office as well as his house on the hill which he 'shares' with his mother. Something that Hitchcock does to a very basic level with these seemingly innocent, everyday locations is turn them into spaces of the 'uncanny' variety. That is to say, at a time when Hollywood's studio system permitted definitive genres to be shot on certain sets well suited to the genre film being made, (a mad scientist's laboratory for horror or the inside of a space ship for a sci-fi) Hitchcock manipulates offices and houses and other such 'spaces' and turns them on their heads for what the locations initially demand you produce there.But the toying with the genre isn't limited to just this. The set up involves a certain Marion Crane (Leigh) and the theft of a large amount of money from her boss. What is set up as a road movie, in which we might assume chase to be the primary narrative drive, turns into something completely different. Initially, the film is driven by a woman. Marion is presented in a less than flattering light, established at the very beginning when it appears she has spent the entirety of her lunch break with another man out of wedlock. Following this is the theft and the complete disregard for authority and her own safety when it transpires she sleeps in her car and very quickly tries to get rid of a police officer when he questions her.For this passage of film, Psycho relies on its suspense revolving around whether Marion will be caught as would-be lines of dialogue are exchanged within Marion's mind to do with what her peers are debating back at her work. What we assume will be a (routine?) chase film-come-thriller as her boss strives to get his money back will become something else entirely, aptly marked at a certain point in the film in which special attention is given to the removing of the money from the piece. Following this, a new plot drive, indeed protagonist, takes over the reigns of the film and it branches out into a different beast.I suppose we are meant to consider Psycho a horror piece, despite it starting off as a thriller told from the guilty's perspective as essence of chase looms in the background. Later on, following the famous shower scene, tides will turn and what essentially remains a detective story is told from a killer's perspective. The film places the audience within the world of a murderer and we begin to see that world through the eyes of this character, something that occurs perhaps slightly out of turn when Norman spies on Marion getting undressed in her motel room by the office. It is a signifying of power; a placing the audience into a position of power that they are forced to share with Norman, whom, at the time, probably just comes across as a little eccentric. Later on, however, the audience are completely roped in and must share the stress with Norman. A clever move on Hitchcock's behalf is in the form of private detective Milton Arbogast (Balsam), who badgers poor Norman at the motel reception about recent visitors. Norman squirms and, as an audience, we may have an immediate reaction of not wanting Norman to get caught out. But should we be feeling these emotions given who he is and what he did? If Psycho achieves anything, it is the manipulation of genre and film language, but it is additionally the breaking down of a character archetype. For the film to spend time with Norman, a seemingly normal human being, as this 'monster' inhabiting a horror film, is extraordinary. There is nothing initially uncanny about Norman and he is a far cry from previous horror genre 'monsters' in the form of anything Universal had to offer at the time. But the film retains a spooky and unnerving atmosphere, punctuated by set pieces involving the aforementioned Arbogast, in a memorable scene on some stairs; but also right towards the end when normal, everyday individuals move in on Bates' house to uncover the truth, in what is a sequence that is still rather frightening. Psycho is somewhat of a towering achievement, and the fact an individual produced this sort of a film yet still managed to cause debate as to whether it's his out-and-out best work, is arguably the most incredible thing about the Psycho.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "The horror and the terror combining on a broad canvas of genre manipulation; psychoanalysis and deconstruction of an archetype in what most say is Hitchcock's best.", "date": "2009-05-21T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2069496", "sentiment score": [0.0414, 0.2262, 0.3705, 0.3147, 0.0471]}, {"content": "Marion Crane (Leigh) runs away from her job and life with a huge amount of money at her disposal when she stops at the Bates hotel and meets troubled Norman (Perkins) When exploring the most successful horror films of all time, Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho will more than likely crop up amongst others including Stanley Kubrick's The Shining, Nightmare on Elm Street or Scream. There have been many changes to the genre over the last couple of decades, perhaps the most significant when the genre went digital with the psychologically frightening Blair Witch Project. But as times grow many horrors are spurned with little effect on the viewers who expect someone hiding with typical music and degrading stereotypes, for example The Hole.Psycho, released in the early 1960's, may have lost an edge in sharpness with technology inevitability taking control over scares but the shock and drama encoded remain intact and is still a favourite amongst horror fanatics and the shower scene is still debated as one of Alfred Hitchcock's best.Starting off Psycho sets Janet Leigh and John Gavin debating their future and soon Leigh has money and sets off on her own. This act of selfishness and greed brings viewers right up to scratch as her angelic image is far from her devilish actions and we soon have a thriller on our hands.

The opening sharp cut title sequences and credits role with a finely established mixture of sophistication and sharpness that generates a feeling of excitement and tension to set you up for the film.As far as horror films go these days you will see a helpless stereotype waiting for the inevitable to happen.

We are entering a progressive descent into some kind of hell but we go down one step at a time without knowing there will be more steps after this one. This descent is represented in the film by the steps going up to the house behind the motel, then the steps going up and down from one level of the cabins to the next, then the staircase inside the house going up to the rooms but also going down to the fruit cellar. This image, which is a metaphor of the mind when it is swallowed up by insanity, is essential and cannot be in color because an insane mind is a whole set of hues and shades of grey. But Hitchcock in this case constructs the plot itself that way. Sexual temptation for the boy friend, then mutual and reciprocal financial temptation for the money and the girl, then the run, the escape. And then one step at a time the trail is getting hotter and hotter. The boss seeing her driving out of town. The cop finding her asleep in her car on the shoulder of a road. The cop following her and observing her swapping her car for another. The motel to escape the rain and get some rest. The sandwich and the milk, the discussion and the mental trap for her, the poor thief, and for him the poor surviving son. And you can go on and on and that will lead you to the end, but with only one question in your mind. How is it possible that such doom can fall upon someone? But who is that someone? The son, Norman Bates, a killer of his own mother and her lover who was left free to survive in society? The poor thief Marion Crane who was trusted with the un-trustable, so much money that her jaws fell down? There is in this film, maybe more than in most Hitchcock's films, the sense of some kind of doom or fate or destiny governed and controlled by some kind of insane authority. Hitchcock was showing then the God he never alluded to in this film that was governing this world must have gone not AWOL as some may say but insane, frankly schizophrenic. For this sinister world to make sense, you need to state that the master mind of our cosmos is a double personality, good old god on one side and good old Satan on the other side and the fight between the two are not even close to the beginning of an end and our lot will be like that tossed from the benevolent hand of god into the malevolent hand of Satan and/or vice versa as many times as these two will find some pleasure in doing so, as long as we will not cut the branches and the roots of this divine and devilish schizophrenia that is finding its source in our very flesh and mind and that is outsourced by our spirit or brain into some autonomous though totally virtual, an absolute simulacrum, of reality, an outsourcing movement that gives us the illusion of sanity paid for by that mental and spiritual alienation that the invention of these two supernatural beings represents for us. Better be alienated in spirituality than divided in reality. That explains so well the fact that such lines of thinking and representing our own experiential life can lead to all kinds of possible bigotry and fundamentalism, as soon as we decide we are standing on the only side worth it, that is to say the side of good, the side of god, the side of light, without understanding that there are so many shades of light and so many hues of shade that if we all stand one-sided and one-spirited and one-minded for what each one of us consider as pure light we are absolutely doomed to commit our daily genocide every day between our morning shower and our breakfast, just as an appetizer for our day of labor. And Hitchcock builds that fate upside down for the poor Marion Crane: the genocide of Norman Bates' mother happens between Marion Crane's evening snack and her before-going-to-bed shower, a shower she will never finish taking and that will be turned into a long bath in some muddy pond. The final and concluding image of the car containing the body and the money being pulled out of the pond is the wink Hitchcock addresses to us for us to go back in time and enjoy the film as a rotten metonymy of real life. He even imposes onto us a five minutes psychological ranting discourse from the local psychiatrist to convince us that all is normal since everything is upside down, but is it? Is it not the reverse: everything is upside down since all is normal, or is it everything is normal because all is upside down, or whatever?

In this example, Norman BECOMES his deceased mother; a mother he killed for bringing confliction and sexual repression into his psyche. Her addition of a new boyfriend into the already sexually muddled situation, added just enough aggression to the mix that it culminated in the murder of both the mother AND the boyfriend, leaving Norman to figure out his own place in the world.Once Norman decided that his mother was still alive and still instructing him in how to behave in life, dictating his actions, and deciding his fate by committing heinous acts of her own, Norman then adapted himself to fit his mother's teachings and instructions.

As pretty rare as it may seem, this genre movie.. Got brains!Norman Bates is a perfect type of a person who lives the past, and can't let it go. He is a clear proof that the strong clinging to the past, with losing contact with the present, makes you a monster indeed. Look at him, lost it after the murder of his mother, where time stopped in one sick point. So when he couldn't utterly face the truth, the reality, he had to continue living yesterday endlessly and dopily. He managed to kill his days by killing his best dreams / the nice girls, because he was a slave of his fear to face the world with his desires, transforming into the most ravenous, as well as the most alive, stuffed animal in his house.Norman buried his mother so himself into this motel where only his demons were comfortable. This old house illustrated perpetually the dark bygone, or the importunate sins, which one can't break away, to become their chosen big tomb, or dreams' slaughterhouse. Strange that nobody ever helped Norman, but since when anybody ever thinks of a troubled person like him in a greedy world that runs after the money, and the money only. Actually, it could be the reason why Norman pulled off murdering whoever came to the motel, as he was stronger than them all, since he doesn't want the money.I liked the idea of suppressed kid in Anthony Perkins's performance as the title character, and how that could make him a serial killer in a way. The dialogue is plain and deep if you catch on the film's main motif, and gets interesting with its sarcastic indications in the second watching: \"Mother isn't quite herself today!\". And Bernard Herrmann is the best when it comes to create great horror music. This man got both the eloquent style and the commercial captivity superbly. I'm obsessed with the opening credits' hot score; as for the story it said it all, and out of it, it could express your deepest nastiness, or the most awful thoughts ever.As for the best moments, I adore the brief, marvelous, zoom-in on Norman's face after he drowned the car, aside from being darkly expressing and distinctive at the 1950s' end, it's a slight touch that confirms how Hitchcock was in love with the art of cinema. Although the most terrifying moment for me was having finally the chance to see Mrs. Bates' face, but in the next viewing, it became the moment in which Norman as Mrs. Bates smiles at the camera's eye refusing to harm a fly, and - in one split second - we see the ghost of the real mother's empty skull while the dissolve of the lifted car / the film's last shot, embodying that Norman became totally imprisoned in his mother's corpse; as you see, Hitchcock did it so someone would see it, as well as relish it, in a next viewing, assuring that one viewing isn't enough.For negative points, unlike millions I hated the bathtub's crime scene. Yes, it was different, frightful, and Hitchcock enjoyed handling it cinematically, but it took sex and violence to extremes on screen, representing a new age of exploiting these factors in more shocking, less human movies. I know that it's art, and the artist is free, and their creations have to develop, however when these creations stray from decency and morality, and lean towards obscenity and commercialism, then it's not development anymore; it's deterioration.Btw, maybe the reputation of the rest of Psycho's franchise, as lower than their original, comes from the fact that they were only the exploitation, as cheap horror movies, with nothing under the surface to present, let alone the matter of breakable surface already, with less artistic everything, as if the producers took the worst of Norman Bates and Marion Crane; killing madly, and greed for money!Psycho is some climax for Hitchcock, in terms of ability and popularity. It's a fine genre movie with possible meaning, which is very fine in my book. And the best about it was that it achieved being the most *film* among all the genre's movies.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Clinging to The Past !", "date": "2008-12-21T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1993495", "sentiment score": [0.0317, 0.0854, 0.1424, 0.4303, 0.3102]}, {"content": "Without a single doubt, Alfred Hitchcock is the greatest director who ever lived.

Yet, such movies usually lead us to a dilemma of high expectations and the subjective reactions after first viewing.When I decided to see PSYCHO for the first time, I was surprised with one feature that from the very beginning and throughout the whole movie caught my attention: intellectual authenticity. That concerns all aspects from performances to soundtrack and script. Since PSYCHO by master director Alfred Hitchcock was released almost 50 years ago and has already \"experienced\" the test of time, we could well expect this movie to occur dated due to its black and white nature and allegedly old fashioned acting. However, what appears to all viewers is just the opposite. The movie still impresses as a clever story, still shocks as a horror, still stuns with its cinematography and soundtrack as a work of art.Who can possibly ignore the flawless thrill in various moments of the film that remain in memory for long, moments of stunning cinematography, marvelous lighting that make black and white more attractive than lots of top visual effects? Except for the famous shower-murder scene that combines gore with sexuality and thrill with empathy, there are really breathtaking moments that lead the viewer to the extent of \"orgasmic\" trance of mind. Consider for instance, Marion (Janet Leigh) driving a car and her thoughts of various sorts. Another moment worth attention is Marion - Norman conversation...someone would perhaps ask \"what's brilliant about it?\" Everything! It is simply the moment of mental power that I have hardly found elsewhere, you, as if (of course illusively) get into the mind and perception of this man, into his peculiar hobby, into his very island of \"divided\" self. The shot of Norman's house with cloudy sky in the background makes an enormous effect. And here, it's a must to mention the marvelous scene of Lilah (Vera Miles), Marion's sister approaching the house... How wonderfully filmed, what a soundtrack, what a power of illusion and bliss of thrill! Nowadays, one can only imagine how innovative and convincing the film must have been in 1960...The performances in the film are sublime. I find all of the acting remarkable but if I were to choose the three most memorable ones, I'd say: Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles/Janet Leigh and Martin Balsam. I know that this choice may seem inaccurate to some readers but that is my personal opinion. Perkins gives a masterwork of performance embodying a character of true psychological contradictions that we find later, as we get to know him better. Naturally, psychology is hidden, innate and far from being discovered as easily as looks. Perkins had a very difficult task in this film, some of the hardest ones ever, but he crafted it perfectly, including his final scene... Perhaps you wonder why I have combined Vera Miles and Janet Leigh together but it was done deliberately. The two portray sisters and occur to me as true sisters of the same authentic depiction of fear, of curiosity, of sexual appeal. There could not be a better choice for these roles than the two. Finally, Martin Balsam as private detective Arbogast is brilliant focusing on strong personality ready to cope with suspicion and terror. His scene with Norman is unforgettable with this truly accurate wordiness of investigation.But I feel that the gist of why PSYCHO was such a blockbuster and has been popular for all these years is neither its artistic side including performances, cinematography, soundtrack, nor even the direction. Its key of success lies in the fact that it is a horror of a psyche set partly within the psyche. It is not a series of shocking scenes with monsters, ghosts or imaginary creatures but the film rooted in the very riddle of human mind, distorted as it may seem yet pretty universal. The scenes we get near the end of the film, perhaps seem hardly real as if not of this world but after longer inspection, it appears they all make a perfect sense. Therefore, the reason for its authenticity is foremost the movie's psychological aspect memorably presented. Strange numbers add to the mystery of all and the atmosphere works for the rest.All in all, PSYCHO is an unforgettable film, a pearl in the genre and a true model for many modern thrillers that turn either to kitsch or to cheap entertainment. Hitchcock's film is an example of how cinema can entertain, shock, provoke and also educate a bit.

En route, she stops off at a lonely motel where she meets the curious proprietor, Norman Bates, and decides to try and undo her folly. An altogether different and more grisly fate awaits her however \u0085There are three things about Psycho which I think make it so extraordinarily brilliant. One is Hitchcock's direction, which is faultless; this is one of the few films where I can't think of any way it could be made better. Another is the sheer daring of the movie, both in terms of its subject-matter (an Oedipal, matricidal, necrophiliac, psychotic transvestite as a main protagonist was pretty strong for 1960) and its amazing structure, in which the heroine is murdered after forty-five minutes, something no other film has done (though some are close contenders, e.g. L.A. Confidential). Most of all however, I love the way it redefined my favourite genre of horror films. Prior to Psycho, every horror movie had a physical monster, whether it was Dracula, King Kong, The Fly, whatever. Psycho has a monster - its true face is revealed just after Lila Crane finds Mrs Bates, screams in horror and turns around - and it's a man. The monster isn't some alien creature, it is a person. It is us. A thousand fine movies have then built upon that - Repulsion, The Texas Chain Saw Massacre, Taxi Driver, Halloween, A Nightmare On Elm Street, The Silence Of The Lambs - but they were all born out of Psycho. Great directors like Dario Argento and Brian DePalma have essentially spent their careers remaking it (see the latter's Dressed To Kill and Raising Cain particularly). Hitchcock never thought of it as a horror movie, but it is in the truest sense; it's horrifying, the example par excellence of masterful audience manipulation through suspense into a state of delirious anxiety. On paper it is a crime thriller, from an excellent pulp novel by Robert Bloch, and it can be taken that way, but it has so much Gothic spookiness I find it impossible to do so; the nightmarish old Bates house, the grisly fruit cellar, the murky swamp, Norman's eerie stuffed birds in the parlour, the final superimposed subliminal image of Mother's skull on Norman's face. Is his mind simply broken, or is she a vengeful spirit which possesses him ? One of my favourite ideas in the story is how Marion actually gets off the highway when driving through the night. Technically, it's just a device to advance the plot. Logically, she gets lost in the storm. Personally, I think it's some sinister spell that leads her to her doom at the Bates Motel, like a bewitched innocent in a fairy-tale. Both Perkins and Leigh are stunning in this movie; he for his incredible mannerisms and hawkish stare, and she for her stunning intensity and world-weary introspection. Their supper scene together in the back-office is one of my favourite dialogue scenes of all time as these two lost souls briefly connect, baring their souls despite speaking in riddles; \"We all go a little mad sometimes. Haven't you ?\". The role was something of a curse for Perkins, who never really got to play a mainstream part later, but he created an unforgettable character who is at the very top of cinema's long list of social outcasts. His final scene sitting in the cell is one of the most profound and frightening pieces of acting I have ever had the privilege to watch. Equally stunning is Bernard Herrmann's riotous all-string score, with its famous screeching violins and rhythmic cellos. As with the best movies, the music is really the dramatic anchor of the film, hugely inflating all the suspense and terror - when the famous shower sequence batters us into submission, it is the assault on our ears just as much as our eyes which floors us. For those of you who think the Oscars reward quality film-making, this is a good example of a stunning movie which won no Academy Awards, losing out to such cinematic greats as The Apartment, Butterfield 8 and Sons And Lovers. Arguably the greatest of Hitchcock's masterpieces (though I prefer The Birds) and undoubtedly the most influential; it was followed years later by three direct sequels (the first of which is very good) and a pointless shot-for-shot colour remake.

Alfred Hitchcock uniquely directed the first ever slasher movie, and did so with wit, quality, and absolute brilliance. Psycho is the first Alfred Hitchcock movie I've seen, and I am very impressed by it. Now I've seen lots and lots of slasher flicks in my day, but never have I seen one anywhere near the caliber of Psycho.Psycho is about a young woman named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh). While she's at work one day, out of the blue she decides to steal 40,000 dollars in cash from an investor. She goes on the run telling nobody where she is going, and soon becomes paranoid and wary of her surroundings, and also the people around her. On a particularly rainy night, Marion stops at the Bates Motel where she meets the odd owner Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Norman invites her to eat dinner with him, and takes a considerable liking to her. At first he seems like a regular nice guy, but it turns out that he does have a dark side after all. Norman's \"mother\" is a very controlling woman, and as it turns out may be a murderer as well. Using Norman to cover up her vicious attacks. Marion goes missing, and tensions and suspense raise to unbearable heights as Marion's sister and boyfriend, and also a private investigator, begin looking for her. Leading them all the way up to none other than the Bates Motel...and Norman \"himself\".This is the greatest horror movie I've ever seen, and definitely one of the greatest horror movies of all time. The suspense is built up incredibly, and the story's twists and turns are amazing. I could never successfully guess what was going to happen next in this movie. And you can't say that about most slasher movies these days. After watching Psycho I realize how much recent slasher films blatantly rip off Hitchcock's masterpiece. However Psycho will now remain an unmovable cinema classic in my eyes, and those new age ripoffs will not. It amazes me how a film that is nearly 50 years old, and in black and white, can still terrify audiences. It's simply astonishing what Hitchcock created here.Now I'll get into the film itself. Just about everything is done right in Psycho. The editing is among some of the best I've ever seen. The cinematography really helps a lot of scenes, and only adds to the terror. Take the \"shower scene\" scene for example: It was shot in such a way that you couldn't see any nudity; and I also appreciated how the scene starts up very bright, and as the dark sinister figure moves closer to the curtains, you get that ominous feeling that tells you that something very bad is about to happen. The acting is also very good. Janet Leigh gives a strong performance, and I'm telling you to keep an eye on her facial expressions, because they reveal her character's paranoia and regret. But the real star of the show, the reason the movie is called Psycho, is Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. Perkins plays one of the best villains of all time, and one of my personal favorites. You don't know what is going on with this guy. At first he seems normal, then he's covering up a murder with a boyish grin on his face, and then you get to his real personality underneath. Perkins plays Norman as a complete mama's boy who stutters under pressure, and on the spot tries to think up ways to cover up his \"mother's\" murders. At first it seems to be an average performance, but then you begin to notice how Perkins makes his character stutter with nervous ticks, and laughing when he makes a joke. It's the tiny details, of which there are quite a few, that make Perkins performance into one of the scariest movie villains in history.Psycho is an ingenious horror film because it blends natural horror with great acting, surprising twists, red herrings, suspense, and a constant sense that something is very bad is about to happen. Hitchcock has created the best horror I've ever seen. After 50 years it is still suspenseful and terrifying, and that is the mark of a brilliant filmmaker.

The film made Norman Bates a household name and permanently guaranteed its director's status as the master of suspense.Psycho is a curious shocker devised by the master of suspense Hitchcock as a tease and received most critics as an unpleasant horror piece. After enormous commercial success it achieved classic status over the years, despite effective moments of fright, it has a childish plot and script and its interest is that of a tremendously successful confidence trick, made for very little money. Probably the most visual, most cinematic picture he has ever made. I think the film is a reflection of a most unpleasant mind, a mean, sly, sadistic mind.After many talks about a remake finally one come with Psycho in 1998 starring Julianne Moore, William H Macy and well\u0085. A terrible actor called Vince Vaughn. This version isn't a sacrilege, it's just pointless. To those who like the remake it is all very well having your tongue praising the film, but it does help having a brain in your skull. It also spawned two sequels and a TV series starring Lori Petty. The first sequel is a reasonably inventive sequel, if on the gory side. It probably holds the record for longest delayed follow up.The narrative is very unusual for its date of release as there are two separate narrative strands. The storyline firstly is from Marion stealing the money which is helped along with misleading the audience into believing that the patrolman and Marion will be a story about a girl who steals money. The film has influenced many other especially What Lies Beneath which is literally a Hitchcock Pastiche. I also like that it is black and white photography as the blood colour (red) was to gruesome to show in 1960. And also it was less budget. What I like about the film is that it lends to the horror genre like Silence Of The Lambs is that they have no actual supernatural undertones even slashers like Halloween and Friday The 13th have supernatural undertones; honestly how many times can you be shot and survive only to appear in another.The film is definitely one of my favourites.

I agree with this statement, especially in the case of 'Psycho'. The murder scenes in 'Psycho' are very sub-par by today's standards, in that you don't see much blood (and the blood you do see isn't very vivid, as it is black and white), and in one stabbing scene, you don't even see the knife penetrate the victim's flesh. The murder scenes are also obviously fake, and by today's standards of gore, are almost laughable.However, these negative points boil down to almost nothing when you compare it with the positive points in \"Psycho\", and I believe that some of the biggest positive points of the movie were the extremely well made suspense sequences, especially the scene where Lila Crane is in the house at the end. Alfred Hitchcock is known as \"The Master of Suspense\" and these scenes are a very good example of why he is called that. As Hitchcock said, the terror is in the suspense. In this movie, there are only three sequences which could be defined as \"violent\", although, because of the heart-pumping terror of the suspense scenes, \"Psycho\" is, for me, one of the scariest movies I've seen.When comparing \"Psycho\" to new horror movies, \"Psycho\" wins hands down. While most modern horror movies are infinitely more violent than \"Psycho\", none of them seem to have the same gripping, heart-wrenching feeling because of their lack of suspense. With most new horror movies I have seen, such as \"Saw\" the movie didn't really get much scarier after the first bit of violence. For \"Psycho\", the effect was almost opposite, and the lack of violence was, in fact, one of the movies strengths.I would say that \"Psycho\" is what a real horror movie is.

That's part of its charm; it's simplicity gives Hitchcock a lot of room to work with, and really develop every last detail to create its greatest impact. The fact that the film survived almost fifty years (and a remake) proves that all the work paid off.The less said about the story, the better (in fact, the best thing to do is to go into this movie knowing as little information as possible). I will say this: A woman (Marion Crane) has just stolen $40,000 from her boss and skipped town to join her boyfriend, and on the way she stops at a motel.There are two names (of real people) that are always going to be associated with \"Psycho:\" Alfred Hitchcock and Anthony Perkins (arguably Janet Leigh would also be mentioned, but she doesn't create the impact that the other two do in my opinion). Both of them work wonders here. Hitchcock has created the perfect film; everything works so brilliantly that I can't even find words to describe it. Down to the last detail, Hitchcock meticulously constructed one of the most awesome and terrifying films ever to grace the screen.People may not remember Anthony Perkins' name, but anyone who has heard of \"Psycho\" will recognize the name Norman Bates (which is the point of acting, though the opposite is the case in today's world). That is how effective his performance is. I recently watched \"The River Wild,\" where Kevin Bacon does a terrific job of portraying a character who is sympathetic in the beginning and a total psychopath later on. Anthony Perkins accomplishes the same thing, and his performance is a lot more effective. At the beginning, he's a young, boyish sort of man who is a motor-mouth at the beginning because he is absolutely smitten with the beautiful woman who has just stopped at his hotel. His charming personality slowly turns to being a frightening one as the movie goes on, and this is accomplished with the same effectiveness. It is especially noteworthy that he does this completely in sync with Hitchcock's direction.The other actors are understandably overshadowed by the Hitchcock and Perkins, but to their credit no one can hold a candle to what they accomplished. Actually, the other performances are very strong. The females are the most successful, especially Vera Miles. Miles is the perfect anchor for the film. She finds a balance between anxiety and determination. Even though she is not given much to work with, she creates a sympathetic sister. Wide-eyed Janet Leigh is also good (though she overacts slightly at times) as Marion Crane, and her scene when she talks to Norman is delicately handled (though even she can't help but be out-shined by Perkins). Martin Balsam brings a noirish feel to his character, but he still fits right in. Like Perkins, John Gavin has a change of character, though he goes from charming to determined instead of psychotic. Gavin makes Sam Loomis easy to sympathize with.James Berardinelli, a film critic that I greatly respect, said that \"Psycho\" is not Alfred Hitchcock's greatest film is not his best because it lacks the story and character complexity of \"Rear Window\" and \"Vertigo,\" the latter of which I have not seen. I respectfully disagree. Why? Because it doesn't need them. \"Psycho's\" simplicity works to its advantage, and it's clockwork like procession adds a deeper level of fear that a film with more complexity in any area would not be able to create.I often say that \"Halloween\" is the scariest movie of all time. Strangely, though, I gave that film an 8/10 and this one a 10/10. The reason is because while \"Halloween\" is one of the most frightening films I have ever seen (and in some parts scarier than this one), it is not without flaws. \"Psycho\" is flawless and, maybe because it's been a few years since I have seen John Carpenter's film (and a lifetime before I will see it again), more polished. I also said that \"Halloween\" creates a high level of suspense with minimal violence, and that is true, but \"Psycho\" does it with even less.Earlier in this review I said that it is better to go into this film knowing as little as possible. This is true, though \"Psycho\" is so well-known that many people already know a lot about it, especially the ending twist. I was one of those unfortunate souls who knew about it, and while I have to admit that a lot of the impact was lost because of this, Hitchock still delivers the goods well enough to warrant a viewing.\"Psycho\" was remade shot for shot by Gus van Sant in 1998. It would be interesting to see what difference there is in the two versions (though I've heard the remake is terrible). Still, I'm going to see the remake and be the judge. But maybe I'm making a mistake, for the reported awfulness of the remake may taint the praise I have for the original.

It had new and innovative cinematography techniques and a very complex plot line. It was no doubt one of a kind and is still unrivaled by any other thriller because it is impossible to copy it. Psycho is the exact opposite. Psycho was the first true slasher film, but even more, it was the first thriller/horror blockbuster. Sure their had been others before it, The cabinet of Dr. Caligari and Frankenstein for example, but none of them hit home the same way that Psycho did. Psycho is a triumph for the common movie watcher. It is a movie that any one can enjoy because it is deceptively simple. Even more than that, however, it is probably one of, if not the, most influential films ever. Many films have tried, unsuccessfully of course, to imitate its one of a kind plot and execution. Any slasher film about a family going to a secluded place and being stalked by an invisible killer can be traced back to psycho. But even with the endless copies and even one remake, no movie has ever captured the horror of Psycho. The Exorcist was a text book grossout film, Jaws was scary for frequent beach goers, and Alien was a horrific movie about our friends from outer space. All three of these don't approach psycho for one reason and one reason alone: The Shower Scene. It is hard to still get the full efect of the shower scene because there is so little blood. It is nothing compared to some of the brutal murders from movies such as Last House on the Left. It, however, taps a nerve that no one else has, and that is not from too little effort. No, it is great for one reason and one reason alone, it is a SHOWER scene. This is the reason it is so scary. I could not take a shower with the curtain closed for a week after I saw this movie. The reason it is so scary is because most people in America take a shower at least once a day. Sure Jaws is scary, but some people go there whole life time without going to beach. Everyone takes showers. It is also hard for the average person to realize just how vulnerable they are in the shower. This is the reason why this scene is so powerful. It uses an event that happens in many households every day. This is what sets psycho apart and this is why it is so unique.

Well, I must say that it deserves it. Before Psycho, censorship was extremely strict. Psycho broke a lot of rules in its day... not only did it go above and beyond with its famous murder sequences, but it also went above and beyond with smaller censorship rules. Psycho was the first American film where the audience could clearly see a flushing toilet in full frame. Psycho was also the first film to show a women walking around in her under-garments for an extended period of time. If Psycho had not come around, it could very well be possible that the idea of Jason stabbing a teenage couple having sex would have been frowned upon by the censorship boards. Psycho changed the way movies where made, which is what opened up the idea of the slasher film, and the horror genre in general.There had been horror films before Psycho, but none broke all of the rules that Psycho had. All the rules that Psycho broke became rules that everyone broke. For this reason, there have been too many Psycho rip-offs to count. Scream, Friday the 13th, Saw, A Nightmare On Elm Street, Halloween, and even Black Christmas are all pure rip-offs of Psycho's success. This could very well be Psycho's only con, and it isn't even the film's fault. Now don't get me wrong, Halloween and Friday the 13th are good films, but if you are at all interested in horror/suspense, you have to view the movie that set new standards for the genre when it was released in 1960. Today, in 2008, Psycho doesn't seem nearly as well done as it was when it was released. However, it is just as good as it used to be. The only reason it doesn't seem good is because of one thing... publicity. AFI, Youtube, Google... It's all the same. Surly everyone alive today has seen the shower scene somewhere, whether or not they have seen the movie. I had personally seen certain scenes before viewing the film itself, so a large amount of the impact was lost for me. Psycho still left a chill on my back, and worked very well. If you are one of the lucky few who haven't seen clips of Psyhco, I highly encourage that you do not search for any. Search out the movie itself. As for the film itself, it is purely remarkable. The cast is extremely remarkable. Anthony Perkins is extremely amazing in his role as Norman Bates. Perkin's performance isn't only Oscar-Worthy, it is also one of the greatest performances of all time. It is up there with Anthony Hopkins' role as Hannibal Lector in my book. Janet Leight and Vera Miles are also very good actresses, and fit the role of heroine in Psycho very well. The acting in Psycho doesn't seem dated at all.The suspense is also spectacular in Psycho. Alfred Hitchcock's brilliant directing and Bennard Herrman's chilling score work together to build up atmosphere and suspense for the film. This is done extremely well. Psycho may very well be one of the most suspenseful movies of all time. Another thing that helps with the amount of atmopshere of the movie is how real it looks and feels. Everything in this movie seems realistic to the viewer. You can relate to the people in the film, especially with the way the characters are developed.Psycho may very well be the flawless movie. It has everything to not only make it a great horror film, but a great film as well. Any horror fan should check out Psycho, simply because it set so many new levels in the genre. Any film fan in general should check out Psycho is well, simply because it is so well made. Psycho is a must view for everyone. A lot of the movies from the 50s and 60s seem very cheesy by today's standards of computer animation and slang talk. However, Psycho still fits in with the classics. This is because Alfred Hitchcock directed his movies for the audience, not for the critics. This is obviously why the critics responded terribly to it. There were very few positive reviews for Psycho by all of the huge film critics, yet it still ranks as the 21st greatest film ever made on the IMDb top list. Hitchcock was able to not only make this movie well, but he was also able to make it enjoyable.Psycho still ranks in with the HORROR classics as well. Perhaps this is due the way it inspired so many films to come after it. This may also be due the fact that Psycho plays with all of the fears that thrilled audiences just as much today as it did in 1960; The thrill of running from the police; The fear of run-down motels; The fear of strangers; The feel of taking showers alone; and of course: The fear of our mother's rage.For more horror film reviews, check out my channel on youtube: horrorreviews123", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 2}, "heading": "\"We All Go A Little Mad Sometimes...\"", "date": "2008-06-29T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1901732", "sentiment score": [0.0259, 0.0599, 0.138, 0.4898, 0.2863]}, {"content": "Let's start at the end: it's fun to watch.

Of course, that was back in an age where there was no internet, very few channels to watch on TV, and spoilers weren't put out forever and a day. I was lucky. I hope anyone who hasn't seen film and enjoys films is as lucky as I was.You know the story: THE GREATEST MACGUFFIN EVER TOLD! The great Alfred Hitchcock totally fools us into thinking that this masterwork is about retrieving a stolen $40,000 when in fact it is about SOOOOO much more than that!

Along the way she has thoughts of various conflicting thoughts and emotions of the results of her actions and ends up at the Bates Motel.Ahh, the Bates Motel! The most famous location in all of film history! Marion meets the proprietor and manager Norman Bates (played by none other than Anthony Perkins in one of the most stunning, sterling, fascinating, perfect performances in film history). Norman is the mama's boy to end all mamas boys! The parlor conversation between Norman and Marion has got to be, to this day, one of the most fascinating talks between two lost souls ever put to screen. The angular way that Hitchcock shot it adds to its brilliance. The albeit too brief 'relationship' between Norman and Marion is never talked about enough for me: it's obvious that her sexuality intimidates him and is rather off-putting. And you can tell that she finds his sweetness and vulnerability a refreshing change from the big city jerks that she is used to. Two great performances, both of which should have won Oscars. Leigh was nominated for Best Supporting Actress and the fact that Perkins wasn't nominated for Best Actor may be the all time biggest oversight in Oscar history.PSYCHO is fascinating on so many levels and gets a lot about human nature right: the aforementioned sexuality that lies within all of us, the different levels of guilt that all humans possess (virtually every character in this film is guilty of SOMETHING), the ways that men objectify women, and fact that all of us at heart are shaped by our parents, whether we'd want to admit it or not.This is Alfred Hitchcock's greatest film accomplishment for me, and that says a lot because he is my favorite director of all time. He got nominated for Best Director (the Academy got that part right), but didn't win (Academy got this one wrong). And PSYCHO is in the top 5 films of all time for me also.

The movie theatre is quiet; 45 minutes ago, the halls were buzzing with anticipation, but not anymore. Nobody has been allowed into the cinema since the picture began, and the audience is dead quiet. Through the walls of the theatre, one can hear the muffled whirr of running water. Silence. An indistinct shadow is seen approaching through the curtain. Accompanied by the fierce screech of violins, hundreds of voices suddenly utter a deafening chorus of horrified shock; some patrons collapse into the aisle. Bernard Hermann continues to pound the violin with extraordinary intensity, and a bloody streak carves its path towards the drainpipe. Audience members reel with a frantic mixture of stunned confusion and gripping fear. The Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock, has just painted the most extraordinary masterstroke of his distinguished career. The simple act of taking a shower will never again be the same.Though he produced many films that could justifiably be considered masterpieces, it is unlikely that Hitchcock ever directed anything more popular and influential than 'Psycho (1960).' The first of only two Hitchcock horror films, it shocked many with its unique narrative structure, and the infamous \"shower scene\" has become permanently imprinted in the movie-going public's collective memory. Hitchcock allegedly produced the film in order to reclaim his designation as \"The Master of Suspense,\" as he considered Frenchman Henri-Georges Clouzot to have temporarily seized the title with 'The Wages of Fear (1953)' and especially 'Les Diaboliques (1955).' Interestingly, the latter film has a particularly alarming bathtub sequence, and perhaps 'Psycho' was the film through which Hitchcock was able to respond to (and improve upon) the achievements of his chief rival. Gone are the larger-than-life artistic flourishes of 'Vertigo (1958)' and 'North by Northwest (1959)' \u0096 this is the Master of Suspense at his leanest and meanest, a film completely stripped of its spectacle and lowered into the unfathomable depths of the disturbed human mind.Adapted by Joseph Stefano and Samuel A. Taylor from a 1959 novel by Robert Bloch, 'Psycho' opens with the character of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a real-estate secretary who impulsively steals $40,000 from her boss and flees in the direction of her California boyfriend. Her cross-country flight ultimately leads her to the Bates Motel, managed by the awkward and mild-mannered Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a man who submits loyally to the wishes of his mentally-ill, domineering mother. Meanwhile, Marion's boyfriend Sam Loomis (John Gavin) and sister Lila (Vera Miles) set out in pursuit, their search ending \u0096 inevitably \u0096 at the Bates motel. The story sporadically shifts from one character to the other; after convincing audiences that Marion Crane is \"the wrong man\" of so many of his previous pictures, Hitchcock deftly strikes at the heart of their sympathies. In his early film 'Sabotage (1936),' the director had condemned his own decision to murder a character with whom the viewer had been asked to identify, though here he once again dared to break his own rules, and we've never forgotten it.Paramount was so aghast at the story's graphic subject matter, labelling it \"too repulsive,\" that Hitchcock's budget was severely restricted, and the director was forced to finance the film through his own Shamley Productions. These budget limitations proved crucial in developing the unforgettable atmosphere, and were a major factor in his decision to film is black-and-white (which he also did to avoid incurring the wrath of the censors). Though 'Psycho' received a mixed critical response upon its release, its commercial success was extraordinary, and film-goers lined entire city blocks to experience the director's latest. Conversely, fellow British director Michael Powell's thematically-similar 'Peeping Tom (1960)' had been severely trashed by critics and audiences alike just months earlier, and the career of the beloved filmmaker was, for all practical purposes, left in ruins. Furthermore, the success of 'Psycho' triggered the emergence of the \"slasher\" flick, and subsequent years saw a slew of inferior, gory and imaginatively-titled knock-offs, such as 'Maniac (1963),' 'Paranoic (1963)' and 'Fanatic (1965).'Though discussions of 'Psycho' rarely stray from the film's more disturbing moments, it's interesting to consider the various crucial scenes of human interaction. Marion's supper with Norman in the parlour room, surrounded by the seemingly-passive but strangely-threatening stuffed birds, is a masterpiece of nervous tension, awkwardness, and the tiny inflections of human speech that communicate more than mere words ever could. Anthony Perkins plays the role of Norman Bates to quirky perfection, and his character {perhaps modelled from Dennis Weaver's jittery hotel night manager in 'Touch of Evil (1958)' \u0096 also starring Janet Leigh} is a man who initially demands our pity and understanding. Even after the atrocity in the shower, Hitchcock, as he also did in 'Frenzy (1972),' builds a suspense sequence around a villain's attempts to conceal the traces of his crime. Martin Balsam is rarely mentioned when discussing the film, but his characterisation of detective Milton Arbogast is letter-perfect, his shrewd but amenable tone successfully lulling Norman into a false sense of triumph, and yet the audience knows full well that the experienced investigator sees the transparency of his lies.Despite the prevalence of cultural spoofs and references, 'Psycho' is a thriller that still holds up exceptionally well, even though most viewers are fully-aware of the first major twist. When I first watched the film several years ago, I was completely ignorant of Mother's true identity, and I gasped aloud at the revelation in the fruit cellar, the swinging lightbulb casting a shifting luminance on the rotting corpse of Norma Bates, as Bernard Herrmann's intense, imaginative and very memorable musical score screeches in the background. Few moments in cinema have succeeded in giving me the same icy chill as the image of Norman in the prison cell, consumed by the mental consciousness of his overbearing mother, and that sinister smile that fades subliminally into the decaying shadow of a human skull.

The film has, to some extent, been hurt by years of imitation and variation\u0085. but taken strictly on its own terms it is one of the finest examples of a director manipulating his audience into the exact state of mind that he wants them.In Phoenix, Arizona, bored real-estate secretary Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is having an affair with a man called Sam Loomis (John Gavin) but fears the relationship will never work out because he is reluctant to leave his wife. She is entrusted by her boss to take $40,000 to a deposit box in the local bank, but Marion senses an opportunity to carve a better life for herself and takes off with the money. She travels towards San Francisco, but en route finds herself in a ferocious thunderstorm. Marion checks into a motel for the night \u0096 the seemingly innocuous Bates Motel. Here she is befriended by the shy and nervous proprietor Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), who lives in a huge, run-down house overlooking the motel shacks and seems to be very much under the constant scrutiny of his domineering mother. Later that night, while taking a shower, Marion is brutally murdered by a shadowy knife-wielding killer. Norman blames the crime on his mother and in a state of distress hides the body. Later, Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) and Sam, aided by private eye Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam), start searching for the missing woman. The trail leads eventually to Bates Motel, and an unexpected discovery concerning the truth about Norman's mother\u0085.Psycho is an example of pure cinema \u0096 Hitchcock doesn't merely follow a singular narrative, but employs every trick in the book (plus a few new ones invented specifically for the film) to extract maximum suspense. For forty minutes or so, the film seems to be a film about a confused woman running away with some money that isn't hers. But the brutal murder - of what we perceive to be the main character - is a masterstroke of audience disorientation. Once the film's biggest star, and the character we have up to that point followed, has been killed how can we feel safe and secure about anything that is to come? The shower scene itself is incredibly powerful \u0096 Hitchcock turns us, the audience, into voyeurs. It's hard to believe that there isn't a single shot of the knife actually making contact with Marion's body \u0096 via brilliant editing and sound effects we are actually convinced that we have seen all that happen, but most of the horror exists in the viewer's mind. Bernard Herrman's strings-only score is quite marvellous and adds additional suspense to an already thrilling film. And the acting is simply superb, with Perkins the obvious stand-out as the complex and enigmatic Norman Bates. The film has been written about, celebrated and analyzed so much that some of its novelty has been slightly diminished\u0085.. but for anyone who has the slightest interest in the mechanics of a \"real\" thriller, this is the ultimate experience.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "A master-class in screen suspense.", "date": "2008-03-31T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1849690", "sentiment score": [0.0079, 0.0272, 0.0738, 0.4837, 0.4075]}, {"content": "The whole movie, in my opinion, was very well thought out.

It is statistically known that when men stab with a knife they hold it in such a way where they stab upward. Women on the other hand stab downward.

Many criticise it for its somewhat slow pace, I supposed that's to be expected from my generation, who are used to watching quickly paced Michael Bay trash. But I didn't find this film to be terrifying like many believe it is, though I suppose that's because I don't carry that nostalgia of having grown up with this film and also because when it was first released, it was the first if it's kind. \"Slasher\" films had scarcely been done in 1960, but now there are at least two released each week. The lighting in Psycho is terrific; it really made me uneasy in the scenes in which Norman Bates was talking to Marion Crane because the lighting is so atmospherically creepy, especially in relations to the shadows the stuffed birds emitted. Alfred Hitchcock did an amazing job at building suspense as well. I was on the edge of my seat up until the shower scene, it felt like the climax, halfway through the film, and things sort of trailed afterwards I find. Anthony Perkin's acting abilities really impressed me, how he could easily switch between his multiple personas all the while still showing us that there is a crazy man behind all his facial expressions of friendliness was fantastic. The score was extremely well written and the composer really connected the visuals to the music in a way that made the viewer uneasy. However, the actual killings weren't well executed in my humble opinion, they felt more unintentionally comedic than frightening, and I'm sure it wasn't Hitchcock's intention for viewers to feel this way.

It wasn't a horror film, at least not in the way I generally thought of them; there's no monster and there are no supernatural aspects. It fits more into the murder mystery category. But it has the feel of a horror film and of course today is usually regarded as such; in fact, many regard it as the best horror film ever made. Alfred Hitchcock, it seems to me, knew exactly what he wanted 'Psycho' to be and didn't worry about categories. An aura of desperate fear and paranoia permeates the film from start to finish, enveloping all the main characters. Janet Leigh's Marion Crane, in particular, is the very picture of someone on the edge, constantly looking over her shoulder, always afraid of being discovered. Her character is all the more believable because Marion Crane seems like the last person one would expect to behave as she does, stealing $40,000 from the office she works at so that her lover (John Gavin) can pay off his debts and they can be together. It is a rash act for a woman who initially seems like your typical office worker, leading a humdrum existence except for the stolen moments she shares with her lover. But she acts on her dream because she is desperate, and desperation drives her. 'Psycho' is atypical in many ways. For one thing, Crane, who is clearly the focal point of the film, is killed fairly early on. The emphasis then shifts to Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), his mother, and other characters who are trying to determine Crane's whereabouts. Bates seems to acquire Crane's mantle of paranoia, at first certain no one will ever come looking for her and even if they do, will never discover that his 'mother' killed her. Seeming a quirky but harmless momma's boy in his early scenes, Bates is slowly revealed to be insane- the 'psycho' of the title. Shot in black and white on a modest budget, 'Psycho' didn't seem to be anything special upon release. Most critics were less than impressed. But audiences certainly took to it, making it one of Hitchcock's most successful films; it grossed $32,000,000 (a huge sum at the time) and subsequent re-issues and television showings added to that figure. And since then, its reputation has grown with each passing year, with reams of film criticism devoted to it and dissecting it. Regardless of the category one wishes to fit it in, horror/thriller/mystery/crime drama, it has long since passed needing such labels, now simply regarded as Hitchcock's most well-known work, possibly his best, one that regularly makes all kinds of cinema 'top ten' lists for best film ever. Bernard Herrmann is easily as crucial to the movie's success as any of the actors; his music score has become irrevocably linked to key moments in 'Psycho,' the shrieking violins almost a trademark. The infamous 'shower scene' has become a part of pop culture history, discussed and parodied countless times.

I will never forget these scenes.According to the story, Marion Crane works in an estate agent and she is wanted to deposit 40.000 $. Crane doesn't return to the agent. Everybody believe that Crane runs away with his friend Sam Loomis but the truth isn't like that. Crane starts to stay in Bates Hotel that takes part in the way that goes to his friend's town. Afher even her sister lost the connection with her, a detective starts to search for her but he disappears like her, too.A man who has two personality that he switch one of them spontaneously. This man is Norman Bates that makes history in cinema by Hitchcock. If your list lacks this masterpiece like me, complete it the shortest time as you can.Quite impressive tension scenes and of course together with sounds, inferences made by the psychiatrist, scenes that make you ask Bates' mother all these are unforgettable about Psycho.My admiration to Hitchcock increases step by step.

Finally, God had heard my prayers. Psycho was going to be shown on the television.I watched it with my mother and sister. My sister went all huddled in a blanket from the very beginning. Overacting, that's what she does, and I got wild at her whenever she talked loudly while the movie was going on, asking spoilers; how the movie would end? Why did she do that? Who was the mother? And what not!And I kept waiting for something the fright the s**t out of me throughout the movie. Unfortunately, I did not find it eerie, scary, frightening at all. But I kept reminding myself that it was a movie of the 60's when there were inadequate means of adding special effects and the video cameras too would have been old and therefore not much effects could be added.I thought the black and white color of the film would make it more frightening but unfortunately it too didn't help that much. Till the end, I kept making excuses, siding the film, about how not much facilities were available at that time.It is a timeless classic and therefore, it is hard for me to give a rating more lower than this. But after watching movies like King Kong where the inhabitants of the Skull island were unfathomably creepy looking, the skeleton of the Mother didn't make me even shiver a bit or make my heart thump faster.The story too was nothing too extraordinary, but an excuse I can give for this is that maybe there are a lot of movies after Psycho which have borrowed somewhat the story from the movie and therefore I found the story of Psycho a bit lame. But I feel that the story could have been better, especially the ending, because Agatha Christie too was I think, alive at that time, and the suspense in her books gave me creeps and made me perplexed.

After Hitchcock died, he later starred and directed in numerous Psycho sequels before Perkins' eventual death. Hitchcock's killing of Leigh at the onset is also quite ground-breaking. It was mirrored in Wes Craven's Scream with the Drew Barrymore character, as well as in many other pictures.Psycho also created the character of Dr. Sam Loomis, a name later used in the other revolutionary horror film, John Carpenter's Halloween.

With Hitchcock's sharp eye with little details, genius camera angles, and keen sense of generating suspense and tension, \"Psycho\" is multi-layered and richly-textured film, actually this is Master's last great picture.The film starts out very slowly. During the first hour, Hitchcock focuses on a single specific event and takes the viewer somewhat familiar point mostly seen in classic film noirs: a confused woman, being stuck in an impasse with a lover bogged down in financial woes, steals money off her employer. Things becomes to go awry en route California (where her lover lives), while she encounters some \"MacGuffins\" such as a mysterious patrolman and suspicious used-car salesman, both are the harbingers of incipient tension and terror. Her edgy trip ends in a sleazy motel off the main highway in a rainy night. Hitchcock startles the viewer while central female antagonist dies half-way through the film, and takes us another sinister place where the real secret is revealed. From this point, Anthony Perkins lead the show as twitchy motel keeper with peculiar idiosyncrasies. This is the role of his life, as everybody is waiting horrified whenever this schizoid time bomb will go off.From the very beginning, Hitchcock imbues the film with a heavy atmosphere of impending doom. Blood-chilling strings of composer Bernard Herrmann adds greatly to the overall moodiness. Today's horror/thrillers depend too much on graphic violence, where blood, gore, decapitations, and dismembered bodies galore. Not overly violent and with almost no blood and gore, the unshakable effectiveness \"Psycho\" mutters up comes from what is implied, but not shown. He always used to make the audience use their imagination. This is the greatness of Hitchcock.Now for the downside, I found the second half of the film somewhat forced. Private eye Arbogast's insatiable obsession with Norman and his ill mother is totally unconvincing. Lila's (Marion's sister) intuition about something bad had happened in the motel is groundless. Sam and Lila's visit to the motel and their sureness about Marion's stay in room number 1 is totally implausible. Also, the secret of the film is predictable half-way through, as soon as all the pieces are put in proper places.

When we think the film is moving in one direction, we find it has caught us up from behind on another level.On one level, the film is about guilt, but not in any way most people think about it. Janet Liegh's hapless victim is actually guilty of a number of old-fashioned sins - illicit sex, theft, lying, sloth, waste, hubris and self-obsession, all of which is soon to be discovered (after the film's end) when her car is dragged from the swamp revealing the stolen money in the trunk along with her body. Of course, the audience knows that she would have repented, had she lived, but nobody in the film will.Anthony Perkins' character, on the other hand, is guilty of - nothing. That's right, not a thing, nada, zip. That's because he's crazy: even his voyeurism is merely a manifestation of his psychosis. This is not simply a rule of Anglo-American law, by the way - it dates back at least to St. Augustine's Civitas Dei and his definitive statement that where the will is absent, there can be no guilt. And one cannot have will when the mind is so wholly disordered, it can no longer discern a choice to be made (that part is Aquinas).Perkins' psychopath thus becomes mere act of nature to the people he kills. If Leigh's character had decided to drive to a church for confession to a priest, and then suffered a fatal heart-attack at the wheel, the moral sociology of this would have been the same for her, discovered in a car with stolen money and no immediate sign that she repented of her sins.Does this make \"Psycho\" a heavy lesson in Christian morality? Absolutely not! Because Hitchcock is not playing just the one game, but several. As to the morality, for instance, it would certainly be a heavy message if it weren't so dam'ed obvious that Hitchcock doesn't take it seriously! The Freudian explanation, and Perkins' final dissolution into the persona of the dead mother form a bizarre bit of comic relief, intended to provide quick and easy explanations to any audience needing these.It may help some viewers to know that Hitchcock said that the only really frightening moment in the film - for him - was the sudden cut to a close up of a state trooper wearing sunglasses when Leigh awakes in her car. Hitchcock was almost paranoid about the police (it actually does show up in a number of films, beginning with \"Blackmail\" from '29). This is one reason his characters frequently seem to have nowhere to turn when they find themselves in legally questionable or suspect situations. And it is this state trooper who first suggests to Leigh that she ought not to sleep in her car but find a bed for the night - which suggestion finally leads to her decision to visit the Bates Motel....Well, who's guilty now?", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 2}, "heading": "a brilliant puzzle game", "date": "2007-09-04T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1724696", "sentiment score": [0.1095, 0.22, 0.3251, 0.283, 0.0624]}, {"content": "Though not my favorite Hitchcock film (that would be Rear Window), this movie is brilliantly crafted.

Both of the leading ladies are excellent. Janet Leigh plays the woman who stole the money, Marion Crane, while Vera Miles plays her sister. But of course the show completely and totally belongs to Anthony Perkins in what is probably one of the greatest performances ever given. He plays the young man who runs the old motel, and is our titular character. What Mr. Perkins did with this character is brilliant: He's a seemingly kind and attractive man. It's pure brilliance.Yes, Mr. Hitchcock gave us a true masterpiece with Psycho. It remains still one of the scariest movies I've ever seen. I had trouble getting to sleep two nights afterwards!

The movie starts off in Phoenix, Arizona where lovers Sam Loomis and Marion Crane are sharing a secret, passionate afternoon in a cheap hotel. Marion is worried that their relationship won't work because they live so far apart and have to keep their love a secret. In the next scene, Marion is at work, her boss asks her to deliver 40, 000 dollars into the bank. In desperation, she steals the money and pursues California to find her lover and run away with him with their new fortune. On the way, however, Marion goes through several obstacles. A policemen finds her suspicious, as does a car salesman. Marion is a clumsy thief. Finding it hard to see the road through a rainstorm, Marion pulls off into an old inn, The Bates Motel. There she meets Norman Bates, a flirtatious, sad, likable guy who's aggressive mother worries Marion. Here are two people, Marion and Norman, who are both trapped. However, Marion has a chance to redeem herself, and she hopes Norman does too. The choice to film in black and white was an inspiration. Instead of grossing out the audience, Hitchcock disturbs the audience with violent and tragic scenes. Joseph Stefano hands over a brilliant script, making this story extremely interesting from a source material that was rather quite dull. We never know exactly where the storie's going and the melding powers of Hitchcock and Stefano are to thank. The music by Bernard Hermann is pure genius. From the second the film opens, our attention is on the screen. The score is all strings, and it brings out the beauty of the black and white picture. Janet Leigh gives a terrific performance as Marion Crane, as do Gavin Lee, Martan Balsam and Vera Miles as the supporting characters. But the best performances come from a voice over work by Virginia Gregg as 'Mother' and Anthony Perkins' defining role as Norman Bates, not only the best performance in his career, but the best performance given by any actor ever. He captures all the subtleties and tragic struggle of the character so well, that he is one of the most memorable characters of all time. Psycho has a terrific surprise ending and a everything ties up nicely in a psychiatric scene most critics seem to hate, but I find resonate. The film has two reaccuring themes: Dependence and hatred of our own mothers. And describing a word by using the same word: \"Eating in an office is too officious.\" \"You make respectability sound disrespectful.\" \"I will not speak of such disgusting things because they disgust me.\" All in all, Psycho is a near perfect film, and a film that hopefully will live forever.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho'", "date": "2007-08-10T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1709701", "sentiment score": [0.0045, 0.0173, 0.068, 0.4815, 0.4287]}, {"content": "After having heard all the noise surrounding this film,I decided to watch this film as I had to give a presentation of a Stephen Rebello's book based on this film for my teacher Monsieur Fran\u00e7ois Thomas at Cinema studies section of the University of Paris 3 Sorbonne Nouvelle.

But the film was just too predictable and had too many laughs where they were not supposed to be.I mean seriously. I can't speak for the crowds in 1960, but if anyone watches this for the first time today, it's pretty obvious where this entire picture is going after we go to the motel for the first time. The title itself is clue enough (he's a \"psycho\" after all) but really, I can't see anyone not guessing the big 'secret' of this flick way before the ending. The film's main characters are cast superbly. Janet Leigh looks great and sexy, keeping the film from being too boring because she's so beautiful and good on screen. And of course Anthony Perkins does a pretty decent job. He doesn't give the awe-inspiring heart-stopping performance that fans of the flick seem to think he gives, but he is very good indeed.The ingredients of the movie are put together very nicely, with the music and editing utilized for the maximum effect. Hitchcock definitely shows why he's known as such a great talent in these respects, putting it all together beautifully.Unfortunately, the film suffers from too many laughs where they aren't supposed to be. When Norman first indicated he's a little \"psycho,\" it's very funny watching him and his serious face as he gives clues he's such a nut case. With \"Mother,\" whenever \"she\" talks (and yells), it's just too funny not to laugh at it. Even the scene when Norman carries \"Mother\" form her room is funny, as she talks her nonsense as he carries her out with her legs dangling.And the \"shocking\" cellar scene almost plays like a comedy skit nowadays. When \"Mother\" is turned around in the chair, what you see just looks too funny not to laugh, and when Norman comes in, combined with his face, the way he was dressed, and the \"Psycho music\" at full bombast, I couldn't help but crack up for ten minutes at the hilarious combination of all this. Sorry to say, what was supposed to be such a frightening scene, is just too comedic to truly scare anymore.It's unreal to think \"Psycho\" was voted one of the scariest films ever made. Who does this movie actually scare?And the cop at the end, with his long-winded speech that sums up the whole picture (conveniently with the rest of the cast sitting and listening intently), is just too blatantly pandering that you just want to say, \"ok, I think we all get it now!\" You almost expect the cop to turn to the crowd in the theater and say, \"ok, does everyone understand now?\" Even the very last shot of Norman is kind of funny, with the expressions he is making. The skull kind of saves the scene, but still.\"Psycho\" is still recommended viewing for any old school movie fan, just to see Hitchcock's work. But the challenge is not to laugh at many certain scenes. The \"Making of\" documentary on the DVD is pretty decent (if not somewhat long winded itself) but the omission of deleted or rare scenes is definitely noticed.

Nothing is on par with the original movie and the director added a couple of unnecessary and gratuitous touches (in the motel scene, Sam is completely nude, and in the \"peeping\" scene, Norman masturbates as he secretly watches Marion get undressed before taking her fateful shower - did we need to see THAT to understand that Marion had become the object of his repressed desire?

He surprises at every turn. He layers some of the greatest suspense he ever put on film. This film will always have a place amongst the classic films.Despite it's greatness, this is the most humble of films. When Hitchcock made this film, he actually did it on the cheap. He used the summer vacation from his TV series & used his regular TV crew to film this. The cast agreed to work for little money.The genius in this movie is all Alfred Hitchcock. All he did was take an ordinary summer vacation, applied his genius to it, and produced an all time classic film. Hitch looked at this as a challenge. He wanted to prove it didn't take a bunch of money & a lot of studio smoke & mirrors to produce a great film. He succeeded beyond anyones wildest dreams.Janet Leigh & Anthony Perkins will never be forgotten for their parts in this masterpiece. Nor should they be, for their performances sparkle. Janet only had to work a portion of that summer. Perkins summer performance would last the rest of his life.This is one of the first films to actually use a throne (toilet) in the film. Until Psycho, movies had never shown a toilet on screen & it is eerie how this throne comes on screen relating to the famous shower sequence. The 5 minute movie trailer with Alfred Hitchcock showing you around the Bates Motel set is a classic trailer for any film.Regardless, it is Sir Alfred who really brought all this into a great film. No one else could have done it better. This film proves it doesn't take money to make a classic, just genius.

It seemed that from the beginning of the movie until she was murdered, she was becoming more unhinged. She seemed paranoid throughout all her scenes, always looking over her shoulder, always nervous. Of course, she had reason to be, but something about these scenarios she played in her head while she was driving to Fairvale seemed unreal. Also, that cop that followed her to California was very unnerving. I sometimes wonder if that was real or a dream, or is Hitch leaving us to decide for ourselves if it is or not. Again, this scene seemed surreal. (That cop looked freaky. Like a commandant of a Nazi concentration camp or something.) Wasn't that Robert Stack who played the gentleman who sold her the car? It sure looked and sounded like him.This is another case of a beautifully crafted story. The way they played up the Norman/mother thing was just pure gold, what can I say? In 1960, this was probably pretty risqu\u00e9, the opening scene showing Marion in a bra and a night slip in a cheap motel. Also, as I recall wasn't it kind of uncommon to show toilets in a bathroom in the movies? I know the codes were pretty strict back then. And the murder scene. Stephen King mentioned in his book DANSE MACABRE that you never actually see the knife striking Marion. You know what? He's right. I've seen this film dozens of times since I read that book and you don't see the knife actually striking her. Your imagination shows you that. But that movie has a helluva kicker at the end. I'm sure there are still one or two people out there who haven't seen it, so I won't spoil it for them. This is the only Hitchcock movie I have, and it's a doozy.

All of which pays dues to this masterpiece, I mean if Psycho weren't made we may wouldn't have had all them slasher movies.

Brilliantly written and structured screenplay wouldn't have been half as effective with the proper casting, but Psycho definitely delivered in that department with performances from Janet Leigh who plays the unlucky Marion Crane who gives an vulnerable and sympathetic performance that had me siding with her despite her dishonest actions, Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates) was mesmerising in his touching, unsettling, insecure and layered role which nobody else in this world would ever compare to, I'd say he gives an Oscar worthy performance. Vera Miles (Lila Crane) Marion's sister gives a good performance as does Arbogast the unlucky private detective played by Martin Balsam gave an interesting performance.

One other particular scene in which Marion is driving on the freeway toward her boyfriend. The thoughts in her head are coming from first person POV. The majority of the story is told through an overall audience narrative. What we see is what happening. But that isn't always true. There were moments where the story was depicted through the core characters personality. It focuses mainly upon Norman's personality. We really feel what he is going through towards the end and we sympathize slightly as mother takes over his persona. Norman is the central character. His interaction with Marion drives his mother to take over his actions. His mother was a pivoting person in his life. He feels as if his mother won't let him live so his dominate personality takes over permanently at the end. The way everything ties in when it starts with going down a different road, literally. Marion faces choices in the beginning. Weighing of the good with the bad emphases each of her decisions. She has the choice to do the right thing, but she takes a risk and is cramped up into a corner. As soon as she decides to change her mind, she is stopped. Director Alfred Hitchcock shows us that things aren't what they seem just because you think you're doing the right thing for yourself. No matter how much you cover up the evidence, you will be caught and sentenced. The deaths are filmed just a painting come to life. When Detective Arboghast gets killed, he falls backward and we are propelled with him as he tumbles to the floor receiving repetitive stabbings from Norman as mother. Just because you know what is right from wrong, doesn't mean that somehow you'll be pardoned. In Arboghast's position, he read more into the problem and ultimately, that was what killed him. He knew too much and would have told Sam and Lila had he the chance if he wasn't stabbed.The POV in the film changes dramatically after Marion was stabbed. It was Norman's business from than on. The film drives us to believe the story is going to be about Marion when in fact, she was the trigger that set off Norman to be the main setting. But as Hitchcock shows us, Norman is an innocent in all of this. He was held captive by mother. She began dominating his actions more and more as the story progress. Another scene in which Hitchcock plays with POV was the scene where Norman was sitting in the station and asked for a blanket. A truly disturbing part of the scene in where he changed POV was when Norman's mother was complaining and blaming Norman for everything that happened to her. The final lines summed up the reasons why mother was so clever to get away with the things she got away with. \"They'll see and they'll say, 'Why, she wouldn't even hurt a fly!'\" It's a definitive film that means so many things but the main idea was that Hitchcock wanted to understand the main focus of the synopsis.

We all know what happens to poor Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) when she makes the fateful decision to stay at the deserted Bates Motel; maybe also the psychotic pathology of the motel's young proprietor, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). \"Psycho\" is widely regarded as the granddaddy of today's horror films featuring outlandish serial killers, after all. For this reason, though I'm a Hitchcock fan, I avoided \"Psycho,\" as straight-out horror is not my favorite genre. It's not that I get nightmares, it's that I dislike cruelty or exploitativeness. Fortunately, when I got around to watching the movie, I found it very impressive, and not at all gleefully bloodthirsty.For \"Psycho,\" unlike a cheap blood-and-gore flick, actually has a philosophy of life to go along with all its horror. In the world of the film, sin, such as Marion's stealing her boss's money, will always be punished. And the long conversation between Norman and Marion over dinner (very well acted by Perkins and Leigh) probes some pretty serious psychological depths. \"We're all caught in our private traps,\" says Norman, and the movie illustrates how first Marion, then Norman, gets trapped. What's most shocking about Norman is how pitiable he is, especially when compared with the villains/killers of other horror movies.Even though \"Psycho\" was made on a relatively low budget, having Hitchcock behind the camera makes for lots of subtly effective shots, images, motifs, etc. He orchestrates two frightening death scenes (I won't spoil it, but there's another, less famous killing that is just as effective as Marion's), a suspenseful beginning that fools you into thinking that Marion is the protagonist, and a quietly chilling conclusion. Bernard Herrmann's score really is as good as everyone says, and not only the shrieking violins during the famous shower scene. In particular I liked the scene where Marion is debating whether to steal the money, and the music mirrors her indecisiveness.I was very impressed by \"Psycho,\" but I'm not sure if it'll ever be one of my favorite Hitchcocks. There's at least one serious flaw: the lengthy scene where a psychiatrist over- explains Norman's psychoses, which is much too prosaic.

It's not until director Hitchcock suddenly pulls the rug out from under the forty thousand dollar robbery setup, and Marion falls victim to the frenzy of a slashing knife accompanied by the now historic soundtrack that's been indelibly identified with \"Psycho\", that we get the idea that this is not your standard mystery.This is a classic and historic movie, the first on many levels to create a new kind of horror film. Hitchcock was a master of thrills and suspense without ever relying on violence. Here he allows a slight departure from that formula, but without overemphasizing the gore. When the naked Marion Crane is attacked in a shower, completely helpless, it was the birth of a new genre, which unfortunately has degraded into the sensationalist slasher schlock of present day. In \"Psycho\", you never see it coming, except for that shadowed figure behind the shower curtain, but by then it's too late to gasp, you're caught up in the on screen event, and it leaves you breathless.Some viewers call it a perfect film. I don't know if I would go that far, as I've thought about things I might have changed in telling the story. When Marion leaves the used car lot under scrutiny of the highway patrolman, it makes you wonder why he didn't follow up his instinct that there was something fishy going on. Then at the end of the film, the way the psychologist explained in detail the nature of Norman Bates' psychosis, made it seem like it wasn't enough to let the viewer arrive at a conclusion for oneself. But those nitpicks aside, one has to give credit to the principals for pulling off a great psychological and horror thriller. Anthony Perkins couldn't have been smoother, and it's not until at least a second viewing that you realize how wonderful a set up you have to the film's dire outcome. Sitting there talking to Marion among his menagerie of stuffed birds, Norman Bates gives a subtle hint as to the horror about to unfold - \"You know what I think..., I think that..., we're all in our private traps, clamped in them, and none of us can ever get out...\"Watch this one alone..., at night..., in the dark.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 4, "votes": 4}, "heading": "\"My hobby is stuffing things...\"", "date": "2007-01-13T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1571618", "sentiment score": [0.046, 0.1749, 0.2843, 0.3961, 0.0986]}, {"content": "A young woman named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) steals $40,000 (roughly a quarter million today) from her employer and runs off to meet her boyfriend. But along the way she stops at the Bates Motel, and meets the charming Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). Marion and her money might not make it back to her boyfriend Sam in perfect condition.Yes, after 47 years of this film existing and being a horror fan for well over 10 years now, I finally broke down and watched what is widely considered to be Hitchcock's best film (I had previously seen \"Lamb to Slaughter\", \"Rear Window\" and \"Vertigo\" -- and have now seen many more since). Boy, was I missing out on something! Now I cannot wait to see \"Psycho 2\" and \"Psycho 3\" (which I own for some reason). I have seen parts of the Gus Van Sant remake but was not impressed.The acting was very good, especially from Anthony Perkins (Norman Bates). He did a great job as a friendly boy-next-door caretaker. Vivian Leigh was also good as Marion Crane, and I am sorry she had to have a hermaphroditic child like Jamie Lee Curtis. All other parts were fine. I hear they called the actor who played Sam Loomis \"the stiff\" and boy are they right! Later in the film he loosens up a little bit, but in the opening scene he seems so wooden.The bird symbolism is nice... especially with Hitchcock's other big horror film being \"The Birds\". And the main character being Marion \"Crane\"? Is she going to get stuffed like the other birds in the parlor? I will not say, but you probably already know (since pretty much everyone knows about this film even if they never saw it).Most startling for me was Bernard Herrmann's score, particularly the main theme (not the knife noise). I had long heard rumors that \"Re-Animator\" ripped off the \"Psycho\" theme and I thought they meant it was a variation on the theme. An homage, perhaps (because who would try to steal from such a famous film). Well, the music is exactly the same. I mean, really dead on. So now I do not know how to feel about \"Re-Animator\", which is practically my favorite horror film (with all due respect to \"The Janitor\")... which shakes up my whole foundation and makes me rethink movie history! My only complaint was the confusion (at least for me) of where the Bates Motel is. Marion drives all Friday night and then arrives Saturday evening, implying it is a great distance from Phoenix. Yet, when the detective investigates the motel, he tells someone on the phone he is less than an hour from them. Where is he based if not Phoenix?Well, if you have not seen this, you should. It is a classic and with good reason (as I typed this the first time, it was ranked the 22nd greatest film of all time on Internet Movie Database and still lingers around 25th three years later).

While Hitch's camera is always the best feature of his films, Herrmann is the artist who puts three of them over the top and into the realm of true greatness\u2014setting them beyond such near-great movies as \"Notorious\" and \"Strangers on a Train,\" which both had good scores, but nothing like the sublime and haunting music of this film. There is no underestimating Hitchcock, nor the work of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, who play the film's two main characters; but without Herrmann this could not have been a great movie.The opening scene is the best place to appreciate both Herrmann and Hitchcock. Joseph Stefano's script is extremely well-structured and it was his idea to make Marion Crane the story's main character, before switching over forty minutes later to Norman Bates. (In the original novel, Robert Bloch dispatches Mary Crane much sooner.) But his dialogue is often stilted, and the opening scene, where Marion and Sam Loomis (John Gavin) share a lunchtime tryst in a cheap hotel, is badly written. The fault is made worse by Gavin, whose performance is stiff and awkward throughout, nowhere more than here. Yet this scene is among the glories of the movie, with the camera, the music and Janet Leigh's performance all giving it an aching poignancy that haunts our minds long after the film is over. Our sense of Marion's longing and frustration, which could not be conveyed by Leigh alone, is necessary for us to understand why she commits the rash act of stealing money from her boss's client. Watch how much is conveyed to us by the camera when Marion suddenly rises from the bed. Listen how much is conveyed by Herrmann's music when Sam spreads out his hands in mock-surrender and says, \"All right.\" The scene as written would seem unworkable in other hands; in the hands of Herrmann and Hitchcock (and Leigh) it becomes masterly.Gus Van Sant's remake, a fascinating failure, helps us appreciate many things about this film, including the performances\u2014even, perversely, the performances of Gavin and Vera Miles, who plays Marion's sister, Lila. Gavin is incompetent and Miles is thoroughly competent, but both have the same effect on us: we don't care about them. Or rather, we would be bored by them if they were doing anything other than solving the mystery of Marion's disappearance. Viggo Mortensen and Julianne Moore give these bland characters more dimension, and in doing so, annoy us with their distracting personalities. Characters that are deliberately featureless often excite our imaginations more than ones that are full of tedious quirks. As is so often true with old movies, their \"faults\" prove to be virtues when remakes attempt to correct them.Oddly, I vividly remember everything about the Van Sant film, except for Vince Vaughn's performance as Norman Bates; I only remember that at the time I thought it was excellent. Anne Heche, by contrast, was memorably awful, especially in the one scene that enhances our appreciation of Janet Leigh. When Marion is in her apartment alone (and without any monologue), packing her things and worrying about her mad plan, Leigh conveys all the anxiety in her decision with a minimum of affectation. But Heche not only makes the putrid decision to play the scene as if she is half-amused by her own craziness; she conveys this idea with the maximum of overplaying, as if she were compensating for her lack of dialogue with broad gestures and eye-rolling. Leigh shows us how she feels; Heche announces it over a megaphone.Anthony Perkins' performance as Norman Bates is among the most memorable ever recorded on film. He is sympathetic and frightening; innocent and malign; horrifyingly unlike us and even more horrifyingly like us. Stefano gives him the best lines; and Hitchcock's camera is preternaturally adept at drawing us into his world when necessary and then coldly keeping us distant when needed. Yet with all this, how much more than a satisfying thriller with a clever trick ending could \"Psycho\" have been without Herrmann's score to help it transcend itself? Could Norman Bates have haunted us as much with a merely excellent score, like the ones for \"Strangers on a Train\" and \"Frenzy\"? Neither Bloch nor Stefano is Shakespeare, and Norman Bates does not live on the page, as Macbeth, Edmund and Iago do. Could Norman Bates, like Shakespeare's characters, live for four-hundred more years? If he survives, it will have been the joint genius of Perkins, Hitchcock and Bernard Herrmann that rendered him, and his story, an immortal nightmare.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 12, "votes": 17}, "heading": "A Hitchcock masterpiece\u2014thanks to Bernard Herrmann", "date": "2006-12-07T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1539096", "sentiment score": [0.0251, 0.272, 0.4846, 0.2099, 0.0085]}, {"content": "Psycho is more than another horror film.

Basically, that was about it, action-wise, BUT I have no complaints because the more I watch this film, the more I like it.

There was Mr. Perkins, the celebrated Norman Bates of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho among all the Trekkies and Doctor Who fans, etc. I think he looked on it as an opportunity to promote the succeeding Psycho films.Tony Perkins was clearly ill at ease among the Sci-Fi crowd. People like the Star Trek cast members know what to expect at these gatherings and act accordingly.

Janet Leigh on an impulse embezzles $40,000 in cash from her employer and goes on the run. She winds up in the Bates motel run by Norman and his mother. Later on private detective Martin Balsam goes after her as well. And finally John Gavin as Leigh's boy friend and Vera Miles as her sister go looking for the both of them.

Before I had even seen the film, I was told how great a job Hitchcock did. I'm sorry but any director who uses a corpse THAT fake looking didn't do enough. Instead of putting little motifs in every scene he should have looked at the simple things. By simple things I mean stuff like the indent in mother's bed and of course that corpse. Plus I'm sick of hearing how great the music score was... yes, the music DID fit the movie well, BUT it was one of the most redundant scores I have EVER heard, and frankly it had gotten very annoying 30 minutes into the film(I laughed when the music started again when the cop chased Janet Leigh). On a lighter note, I thought that Anthony Perkins was extremely good and Janet Leigh wasn't bad herself. I also found myself rooting' for John Gavin's character, Sam Loomis. The directing(apart from the props) was good... I was impressed with all the motifs and imagery(even though I have a sneaking suspicion that a lot of those genius acts Hitchcock took were product of over-analyzation). I am a big fan of Hitchcock's decision to film in black and white. I feel that black and white is much more expressive(especially when you have the option to film in color). I also have a small problem with some pieces of the plot that are very unbelievable. Ex: Marion's receipt found next to the toilet(like hell they would find that), Sam being knocked out by a shot to the back with a pot, the lack of emotion shown by Lila Crane when she finds out that her sister is dead, etc...I know my review sounds bad, but don't get me wrong I did enjoy the film. My position sounds bad because it is easier to point out the bad than the good. I feel that this is a fine film it just has too many holes and pet peeves for me to recognize it as one of the best.

It is my favourite horror film and I can confidently say it always will be. Nothing comes close to the sheer thrills and chills Psycho delivers.

The film made Norman Bates a household name in the world of horror and movie villains. Hitchcock does not rely on cheap, hokey scares to terrify his audience, but uses various camera angles and tracking shots to heighten the tension and then, accompanied by Herrmann's shrieking score, lets lose a shocking image. Hitchcock is quite simply, as his common title suggests, the Master of Suspense.

In Act I, Marion Crane, an employee of a real-estate company in Phoenix, Arizona, embezzles $40,000 belonging to a client of her employer in order to start a new life with her married boyfriend and goes on the run, ending up at a lonely motel. Act II deals with her stay at the motel and her conversations with its owner, Norman Bates, and ends with her murder in the famous shower scene. Act III deals with the investigations into Marion's disappearance, not only by the police but also by her boyfriend Sam, her sister Lila and a private eye named Milton Arbogast.Many people have felt that Act I, and indeed much of Act II, is a gigantic red herring. Certainly, Hitchcock seems to be leading us to believe that Marion is to be the central figure in this drama and the stolen money the \"McGuffin\" around which it will revolve. Her murder midway through the film must have come as a great shock to the audiences who watched the film in 1960, not only because the shower scene was, by the standards of the day, graphic in its depiction of violence, but also because the violent death of the central character so early in the film was almost unprecedented. Marion is young, attractive, blonde (like most Hitchcock heroines) and played by a major star; just the sort of film character one would expect to survive a murderous attack. Moreover, in Janet Leigh's portrayal she emerges as not altogether unsympathetic, despite her crime. One gets the impression that she is not, fundamentally, a wicked person and that she stole the money in a moment of madness. The man from whom she stole is a seedy sexual predator, seen flirting with her and making veiled sexual suggestions. When she is threatened by that sinister-looking traffic cop in his dark glasses, we are just praying for her to get away with it.This is probably the darkest of Hitchcock's films. Many of his films have a straightforward pattern of good triumphing over evil, ending with the villain dead or in police custody and the hero safe and free to marry the beautiful blonde heroine. \"North by North West\", the film which Hitchcock made immediately before \"Psycho\", and \"Spellbound\" are good examples of this pattern. In some films, such as \"Rebecca\", \"Notorious\" or \"Strangers on a Train\", there are elements of moral ambiguity, but in \"Psycho\" ambiguity seems to be replaced by a straightforward triumph of evil over good. Bates might end up under arrest, but not before he has murdered Marion and several other people.There is a clear contrast between this film and \"Spellbound\", another film which shows Hitchcock's fascination with psychology. In that film the character played by Ingrid Bergman is a \"healer of souls\", (the literal meaning of the Greek words from which \"psychiatrist\" is derived) a force for good who is able not only to cure Gregory Peck of his psychological traumas but also to clear him of unjustified suspicion of murder. In \"Psycho\" the psychiatrist is a more neutral figure, able to explain why Bates committed his crimes, but unable to cure him or to suggest how such crimes might be prevented.Yet on a deeper level there is more ambiguity about \"Psycho\" than appears at first sight. The character of Bates, with his split personality, symbolises the duality of good and evil in the human soul. Bates originally committed an evil crime- the murder of his mother and her lover- but has been driven mad by remorse. In his madness, the two aspects of his character have crystallised into two distinct personalities. His \"Norman\" personality (shown in a brilliantly subtle performance by Anthony Perkins) is that of a polite and inoffensive young man. His timidity, his apparent domination by his mother and his odd hobby of taxidermy might make him seem creepy, but never threatening. (His speciality is stuffing birds, and several examples of his handiwork decorate the motel, adding to the eeriness of the film and foreshadowing Hitchcock's next film, \"The Birds\"). Bates has, however, unconsciously projected the evil side of his character onto his dead mother, and it is when the \"Mother\" personality takes over that he commits further evil deeds. One of the things that make the film so frightening is that the crimes are committed by a seemingly inoffensive character.These two aspects of Bates come out in his dealings with Marion. The \"Norman\" side befriends her, the \"Mother\" side kills her. Before she is killed, however, she is persuaded her she must return the stolen money. One of the last things she says is that she must return to Phoenix \"to get out of a trap I've gotten into\". Unwittingly, Norman has persuaded her to cleanse her soul. He destroys her physically, but might have saved her spiritually. If that seems an over-portentous interpretation of this film, we must remember that Hitchcock was brought up as a Catholic and that themes of sin and redemption play an important part in his work. (Think, for example, of \"I Confess\"). There are also, of course, two sides to Marion, symbolised by the change in colour of her underwear from white to black after she has committed the crime.Two things remain to be mentioned. One is that harsh, driving Bernard Herrmann score which fits the mood of the film so well. The other is Hitchcock's direction and his use of black-and-white photography to convey a threatening mood. He said that he used black-and-white to make the film less gory; in fact, it seems far more eerie and frightening than a colour version ever could. (A pity that Gus van Sant did not understand that before embarking on his ill-advised remake).

I consider it Alfred Hitchcock's last great film (apologies to all Birds lovers out there \u0096 I'm sorry, but in Hitchcock's standards that movie really was mediocre at best) as well as the best he had made, and the one in which the efforts of terrific films like Rear Window, Vertigo and North By Northwest finally culminated into one timeless masterpiece. Hitchcock knew what most of today's directors of thrillers and horror movies have forgotten \u0096 how to build up tension and sympathy for his characters. In no film did he do it better than in Psycho. And so, even if it doesn't seem half as violent and horrific as it did four and a half decades ago, and even if the shower scene isn't as convincing as we'd like to remember, it's still one of the scariest and most effective thrillers ever made.Psycho was clearly years ahead of its time, and it laid the groundwork for modern thrillers from Taxi Driver and The Conversation to Fight Club, Se7en and The Usual Suspects. Other than the fact that it's a perfectly constructed film, from the opening titles (by the great master Saul Bass) and the wonderful music (by the irreplaceable Richard Herrmann) which compliments and build the tension and horror to perfection; to the editing, the subtle dialog and the construction of each scene and each shot \u0096 Psycho stood out for the focus Hitchcock put for the first time on the villain character, to whom the heroes \u0096 Janet Leigh as the victim, John Gavin as her lover, Vera Miles as her sister, and of course the great Martin Balsam as the investigating detective \u0096 all take second place.Norman Bates is not only a lifetime performance for the great Anthony Perkins; he is the single greatest creation in the entire Hitchcock catalog, and one of the most fascinating villain characters in film history. It may be remembered that in Hitchcock's previous films \u0096 Rear Window in particular springs to mind \u0096 the 'madman' or villain character was the most unsatisfying and undeveloped element of the film. The murderer's motives are tackled here head on, and in this way it foreshadows many of the greatest thrillers of the 70's, 80's and 90's. Psycho is not about discovering the identity of the killer \u0096 that much can be figured out by any viewer from the first time Norman Bates is on screen. It's about exploring Bates's mind and psych; his dialog is written to perfection and Perkins's performance goes without a hitch.The only scene I still have problems with is the one in which Simon Oakland appears as a psychiatrist to explain to us Bates's motives and his story, thus spelling out what it seems an observant viewer can figure out for himself. Still, maybe viewers in 1960 weren't as immersed in psychological thrillers as we are today and so needed the explanation. This scene \u0096 anticlimactic and slightly too long \u0096 aside, the finale is still one of the most memorable and chilling in film history, and in my mind more impressive that the famed shower scene, making the entire film an unforgettable experience and one of the most effective ever made.

Yet what terrific 'rot' this granddaddy of the horror genre is.So much has already been said about 'Psycho' that adding a comment seems unnecessary, but I'll try and give a brief summary of my feelings towards this film: Hitchcock created one of his most fascinating characters (and one of cinema's absolute finest) in Norman Bates. Anthony Perkins gives a performance that is nothing short of brilliant as the conflicted protagonist, evoking both sympathy for his loneliness and disgust for his actions. Hitchcock manipulates the audiences feelings towards the villain, as he did memorably in the earlier 'Notorious' and 'Shadow Of A Doubt'. Perkins would never break free of this role for the rest of his life, and his Norman is truly haunting. His chilling final scene (his face) will blow you away.Our supporting cast give varied performances. Miles is excellent as usual in her role as Lila Crane; her and Perkins carry the acting honours away. Both John Gavin and Janet Leigh are reasonably good (Leigh handles the notorious 'shower scene' very well), but noticeably weaker in support (particularly Gavin- he just isn't a leading man).Hitch shot this in black-and-white for a purpose- the gore of his scenes would not go down well in colour. Also, shooting in black-and-white gives 'Psycho' an even darker, mysterious quality, with Hitchcock's brilliant use of lighting and shadow to create mood and suspense. It has the feel of a low-budget, roadhouse film, and this effect suits it perfectly.The suspense flows nicely throughout, apart from a rather slow and, at times, frankly irritating, opening sequence. Hitch takes a long time to set this one up, yet once we reach the Bates residence we know that we are in for one hell of a ride- that's when the picture becomes great. The only other significant downer comes near the end where the shocking order of events are explained through some rather (for today) quaint psychobabble. Apparently it was added in to try and explain the horror and motives to terrified audiences in the 60's, yet it comes across as hokey today.'Psycho' deals with then-shocking elements of theft, necrophilia, incest (you'll look at the term 'Mummy's Boy' on an entirely new level after watching this), adultery and murder. This was shocking on first release and it's content is still powerful today, resonating with a modern audience.The murders are handled brilliantly- the amazing, classic shower scene that takes everything we have viewed in the first half of the film and distorts it completely. It is brutal, compelling and, accompanied by Bernard Hermann's screeching violin score, quite terrifying. We don't actually see the knife jabbing into Leigh, yet we still see so much. In this, Hitch effectively 'shifted' the role of key protagonist from one character to another.It's so atmospheric- look at the visual effects used in the Bates Motel, the predatory birds (a recurring Hitchcock motif)that surround Norman as he eats with Marion Crane (another 'bird' from 'Phoenix'). Vera Miles searching Mother's bedroom for clues. The revealing scene with 'Mother' and the swinging light bulb.To say any more would be to spoil a fascinating cinema experience- just go out and SEE IT.9/10.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Creating a Sympathetic, Multi-Layered Villain...", "date": "2006-07-01T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1408032", "sentiment score": [0.0202, 0.0823, 0.2005, 0.5395, 0.1575]}, {"content": "Marion Crane ( Janet Leigh) is a working woman in Phoenix Arizona who just took away some very important money from her boss and runs away to a motel owned by a strange man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins)who owns the motel and lives in a nearby house with his bizarre mother.

His other nominated films as a director were Rear window, spellbound, Life Boat and Rebecca. He never won the Oscar. This time around he lost out to Billy Wilder for The Apartment. What he accomplished from this innovative low budget film probably should have won him the Oscar. This is a low budget film for Hitchcock that in toady;s dollars would have cost about $5 million to make. The film was adapted from the 1959 lackluster novel by Robert Bloch by screenwriter Joseph Stefano. Cinematographer Jack Russell got an Academy Award nomination for photographing this film but no major film offers because of his work, He had did Orson Welles' Macbethe early in his career and was mostly involved in television and a few B movies before and after Psycho. He does a great job here along with film editor George Tomasini who edited Stalag 17, Vertigo, North By Northwest, The Birds and Cape Fear among his many fine films. A memorable music score from Bernard Herrman who did such films as Citizen Kane, The Magnificent Ambersons, The Day The Earth Stood Still, Vertigo and The Man Who Knew Too Much. This is the story of a woman who steals $40,000 dollars and has plans to run away with her married lover but sees her plans and the life she lived evaporate so on the run she stops at a rundown motel off the beaten path that sits in the shadow of an old decapitated wooden turn-of-the-century mansion where the motel keeper lives with his aged mother. It's a classic horror setting and filmed in black and white. Janet Leigh in an Academy award nominated performance as Best Supporting Actress is the woman on the run and Anthony Perkins is the motel keeper who has been hounded by his domineering mother all his life and functions in his lonely existence as a motel keeper of a motel that no one stops at anymore. Also among the cast are Martin Balsam, Vera Miles, John Gavin and John McIntire. This film also received an Oscar nomination for Best Art Direction for it's great set. It's a fairly simple story with twists and turns and a little black comedy thrown in.

The film follows Marion Crane, played by the legendary Janet Leigh, embezzles $40,000 from her employer. She goes and buys a brand new car with the cash, and hits the road to start a new life. That night she gets caught in a really bad rainstorm in the desert, and she spots the bright lighted sign of the Bates Motel, which she decides will be her destination for now. She checks in, and the owner, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), makes her a sandwich. He seems nice, if not a little strange. She then goes to her room, undresses, while Norman spies through a hole in the wall.She enters the bathroom, and begins taking a shower. And I'm sure most of you know what happens from there on. Anyways, Marion's sister and lover begin to worry about her disappearance and hire a detective to investigate.\"Psycho\" is a true classic, plain and simple, and one of the best horror films in history. The whole story (based on the book by Robert Bloch) is very interesting and the film keeps you guessing, because you never really know who Norman's mother is - the mystery shrouded around it all is effective and eerie. The infamous shower scene is now known by thousands of people, so it's kind of trademarked this series of films (although all of the sequels are awful besides \"Psycho II\", which was just alright), and the editing of the scene defines the \"less is more\" saying. The tricky editing used fools the audience into thinking they are seeing more than they are, and it is brilliantly done.After Marion's murder, Janet Leigh's presence is felt like a ghost throughout the rest of the film, while her sister and boyfriend try and find her. Anthony Perkins is near perfection as the kind but strange Norman Bates, he gives the character much depth and a feeling of unease. Janet Leigh is excellent as well in the role of her career as the ill-fated Marion. The film is black and white, which gives it that classic movie feel, I like old black and white movies, although you don't see very many horror ones. The pacing is excellent and the film holds interest wonderfully. The ending is a bit of shocker, and that final frame is one you won't shake easily.Ovearll, this is probably Hitchcock's best film ever. The story is great, the acting (especially by Perkins and Leigh) was pitch perfect, and the film was genuinely scary with some a heavy doses of suspense.

This movie has so many deeper meanings, it's impossible to list them all.

Whilst most commentators (rightly) praise Anthony Perkins for his astonishingly nuanced performance, many overlook the subtler, more measured work done by Janet Leigh.At first, it seems paradoxical that Leigh could be overlooked in what is certainly her most famous role (one of the most famous roles in American cinema, in truth), but it is that very fame that causes people to overlook the actual quality of the work she is doing. After all, the part of Marion Crane is seen almost entirely in relation to the plot's structure - the heroine who is killed half way through the film, and leaves us and the camera somewhat stranded in the Bates Motel, where we begin to follow the story of Norman Bates. It doesn't help that her death scene is probably the most iconic film sequence yet recorded (the Odessa Steps sequence in 'Battleship Potempkin' doesn't have the pop culture cache, trust me). Who notices the actress when Hitchcock's structural and technical experimentation come together with such incendiary force? And yet Leigh is extraordinary, giving what might be the performance of her career. She'd proved herself a winning comedienne and musical star in the fifties, but often seemed to be left on the sidelines - as in the enjoyable 'Scaramouche' and the turgid, tacky 'Black Shield of Falworth' (which nevertheless shows her at her most beautiful - the improbably gorgeous black gown she wears in one scene is the epitome of 'devastating'). Of the three dark thrillers she made in the late fifties and early sixties, she would be excellent in what amounts to three scenes in 'The Manchurian Candidate', and had been perfectly cast but arguably peripheral to the story in 'Touch of Evil'. In 'Psycho', she disappears after forty minutes, but for once gets to hold the screen absolutely in the time she does have.It's a precise performance that shows no strain. She's controlled, immaculate, yet also believably sexual. Mores were changing, and 'Psycho' was at the forefront. There's something oddly shocking about seeing Leigh in her underwear (it would have been taboo under the Hayes code only a short while before), let alone in the shower, but Leigh betrays no discomfort. It's all done so casually, it barely seems as though anything new is being done.What's striking about 'Psycho' on repeat viewings is how melancholy it is. It may be the saddest film the Master ever made ('Vertigo' is bleak in a different way; it has the structure of Tragedy. 'The Wrong Man', meanwhile, has a forced happy ending). A large part of this is down to Leigh, who has to make us care about this woman in a short space of time. She succeeds, but she also succeeds in drawing out the kinkiness and oddness of Marion - the smile she gives when she imagines what is being said about her, for instance, before it gives way to worry and even fear (I've always thought that Leigh was rather wasted as good girls and would have made a great femme fatale - those big eyes and heart-shaped face are perfect - and as Marion she plays on a lot of the qualities that would have made her ideal).A small word here for Vera Miles here, too. Her role is more restricted, but her brittle, guarded performance is another overlooked gem, probably because she isn't warm or sympathetic. Her character is flinty and highly competent, Marion's more respectable counterpart. Their performances resonate with each other astoundingly well given that they don't share any screen time - they really are believable sisters, despite not looking that much alike. Lila Crane is, in many ways, Hitchcock's most straightforward, unkinky heroine. She's also one of his most uncompromising, not brooking argument from Sam Loomis or the Sheriff. Only Arboghast ruffles her. She penetrates to the heart of the mystery with ruthless efficiency. And in a film well known for its ironic one liners, my favourite is Lila's 'I can handle a sick old woman', which works differently depending on whether you know the secret of the film or not (she can't handle that sick old woman - but actually, it isn't a sick old woman at all).", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 3}, "heading": "Janet Leigh - Hiding In Plain Sight", "date": "2006-05-14T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1367214", "sentiment score": [0.0243, 0.2255, 0.383, 0.3251, 0.0422]}, {"content": "Wow.

When people hear the word \"Horror Movie\" they think of butcher knifes into teenage beauties and screaming but no real meaning. In my opinion this is not true. Throughout history, horror movies have had many metaphoric and subtle yet deep meanings. Even the goriest as the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) is not just a movie about a guy in a mask chopping up teenagers. Now, about Psycho, this movie is very interesting. Starting with a plot about a young woman, Marion, who steals forty thousand dollars (More like 400 thousand now according to inflation) to have enough money with Sam, her lover, and live with him. When she gets passed the salesman and policeman she creates other people's conversation in her head as she heads off in the Bates Motel.As the viewer is interested in Marions life a brand new character is introduced, Norman Bates. If you notice Norman is very persistent that she calls him Norman instead of Mr. Bates. Twice he corrects her. This, i feel, is him trying to separate from his mother. He feels so controlled by his mother he doesn't want to be Mr. Bates, which contains his mother's last name in it, he wants to be Norman, himself. Now, as they talk about being stuck in a trap, both of the characters have been trapped into a situation. Norman with his mother, Marion with her money. Both characters have many similarities, split personalities, etc. And I think that is the main reason Norman felt such an attraction to her. Not because of her beauty and charm, but him and her connection. As she leaves he looks through a hole to watch her dress. (Notice what painting he removes from the wall, one depicting a rape) Here he watches her, like one of his stuffed birds, while she undress. I notice both their names have a lot to do with their reasoning in the plot. Norman \"Bates\" as he is awaiting to be caught, and Marion \"Crane\" a bird she is to catch Norman. Anyways, now Marion gets nude and takes a shower. Earlier she suggested returning the money so now the audience is nice and happy. As she is taking a shower, we notice a slight blur in the background. This blur turns into a maniac silhouette mother stabbing the young and innocent nude, blonde bombshell with her 12 inch long butcher knife. What makes the shower scene so intense is not the loud, intense music but the shots, from down watching the knife coming at you, to the mouth of Marion screaming in terror while a the violin is screeching.I have a lot to say, theme-wise about this film but then this will be too long, if you want to know give me a private message and I will send you all my reasoning for many lines.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Psycho, horror movies, and metaphors in psycho", "date": "2006-04-10T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1338194", "sentiment score": [0.0182, 0.0446, 0.0688, 0.2852, 0.5833]}, {"content": "I am 23 years old and have just gotten around to watching \"Pyscho\" for the first time tonight.

Hitchcock's Psycho was released in 1960, before most of today's cinema patrons were born, and today it is not often seen either in the few remaining repertory cinemas or even on TV movie channels. Younger viewers will never be able to experience the shock that this film created when first released. Seeing it on a home DVD can give no hint of its original impact in the theatre. In principle one might expect that by now this film would be nothing more than a fading memory for most of today's movie goers, but instead new comments on it are being submitted to IMDb on an ongoing basis and major film reviewers also continue to discuss it in numerous other publications. Such facts probably tell us all that we need to know about Psycho; but, even if they do not, there can be very little left to say to add to the 511 comments already published by IMDb.Although I originally had no intention of adding any comments, I have gradually become forced to change my mind by the flood of copies, near copies and look alike films that attempt in one way or another to trade on the reputation of Hitchcock's masterpiece. We have an almost shot for shot remake with the same title (1998), as well as Psycho II (1983), Psycho III 1986, Psycho IV (1990), and American Psycho (2000). In total IMDb now lists 97 films with Psycho in their title and many of these clearly hope to exploit the reputation of this 1960 film in one way or another. There are others which also exploit it, sometimes even more blatantly, without trading on its actual title; even though they may be released with titles such as The Psychopath or Psychotic. It is difficult to comment meaningfully on most of these films before my comments on Hitchcock's original are on record, so here goes: Firstly I must take issue with those who imply that Hitchcock was the originator of horror films per se, or even that he was the first director who understood how to use a movie camera to create horror, suspense and tension. If you really believe this, go back and carefully look again at the early masterpiece The Cabinet of Dr Caligari (1920) in which the use of many techniques later so effectively exploited by Hitchcock can be found. Although Hitchcock actually directed one film in 1914, long before Dr Caligari was released, only part of this survives; and even his greatest fans would find it difficult to claim him precedence in the exploitation of these techniques. Hitchcock success was due to his mastery of cinematographic imagery combined with a very adept hand in using whatever technological or artistic developments were available to the maximum advantage. Most of his early work was carried out in the period when colour stock was not readily available or was very expensive and potentially unreliable. Until his reputation as a director was firmly established, Hitchcock was not free to make his films in colour and most of his early ones were shot in monochrome. But before he created Psycho he had filmed a long string of successes, in full colour, starting I believe with the period drama Under Capricorn in 1949. He had also experimented with one important film released in 3D format (Dial M for murder), and his choice of monochrome for Psycho was clearly made because he believed that it would be artistically more effective made in this way. This judgement was so accurate that even today when every movie goer has some familiarity with the story, it is almost universally agreed the visual impact from watching Psycho is far greater than that from a whole library of more recently made horror films.Psycho did not however become the classic it is simply because it is a very effective horror film. The horrors of World War II and the fears associated with the development of the atomic bomb provided more than enough material to occupy most movie makers during the period immediately before 1960, but these horrors remained remote from everyday life in normal North American communities. Hitchcocks genius probably lay primarily in recognising this, and becoming the first major filmmaker to exploit the horrors that result when individuals with normally insipid personalities undergo some experience or trauma that leads them to behave in ways which those who know them can neither understand or comprehend. To see a Hitchcock film generally involves not viewing in a detached way what might happen in some remote and hazardous locale far away from home, but watching with mounting horror what might easily occur in ones own home community in the not too distant future. There are more and more directors who try to make horror films today, but unfortunately very few of them even understand this is why Hitchcock's films remain so much superior to their own.Hitchcock has frequently met well justified criticism for unduly cavalier treatment of the novels that he filmed - he regarded a novel as no more than a framework on which to hang an often very different story created in a different medium, and for this reason his films often irritated readers of well loved books such as Buchan's \"The ThirtyNine Steps\". Although this may also apply to Psycho, we should consider how many readers today would be familiar with the works of Robert Bloch if his novel had not been filmed by Hitchcock?", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "What made Hitchcock Unique?", "date": "2006-03-28T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1327874", "sentiment score": [0.2465, 0.2384, 0.1849, 0.1665, 0.1636]}, {"content": "For those who can stomach it, Psycho is a technical and visual chef d'oeuvre deserving of multiple viewings. It has yet to be surpassed in the horror/thriller genre. It participates in Hitchcock's lifelong fixation with sight, a theme addressed by these notes, which assume the reader's shot-by-shot familiarity with the film.Hitchcock's interest in the human eye is manifold: aesthetic, physiological, psychological, epistemological. Does eye imagery signify knowledge? Or its opposite? How? Eyes function as the mediating nexus between the unknown, outside world and our internal reckoning of it. But far from being the locus of strength and understanding for protagonist, audience, or even antagonist, eyes (and vision) instead serve Hitchcock's epistemologically sadistic project of illogic and fracture. Hitchcock delights in buffeting his protagonist's eye to assault who resides behind that superficies, just as he enjoys striking through the very screen at the audience seated uncomfortably behind it.That Marion's struggle (and our own) is fundamentally an epistemological one is made transparent by her run-in with the disembodied head of a highway patrolman, eyes shielded behind ludicrous sunglasses. His eyes are not the first to accuse her\u0097we remember her boss' glare\u0097and they signal her informational disadvantage. They take in information but betray none of their own secrets (or vacuity?). Thus does Hitchcock subvert Carol Clover's assaultive/projective/masculine\u0097reactive/introjective/feminine dipole: the patrolman's gaze is informationally assaultive precisely because it is introjective only. (We will see the assaultive power of the introjective gaze suggested when Norman eyes Marion through the peephole.)Hitchcock showcases his editorial encoding of the epistemological (pseudo-)order of Psycho's world in the driving sequence immediately following this encounter. This sequence intercuts with rigorous regularity among three types of shots: third-person shots facing Marion; POV shots through the front windshield; and POV shots of the patrol car. The exacting regularity\u0097facilitated by mirrors, a classic Hitchcockian trope\u0097pretends to signal an order, a logic. We imagine Marion trying to parse the auteur's sententious geometry. But no understanding emerges. Elegant as it is, the shot pattern means nothing and reveals nothing, since Hitchcock is a cynic. Alongside such theoretical obfuscations, physical objects designed to enlighten instead prove occlusive: rather than informing, a newspaper conceals (money); rather illuminating, headlights blind (Marion).Eye imagery participates in another spurious rule-of-thumb: the equation that height equals knowledge and therefore power. Hitchcock implies this parsimony in the dinner scene in the parlor. At first, level shots of Marion are interpolated with steep low-angle shots of Norman's birds eyeing her as their prey. Then level shots of her eating take turns with shallow low-angle shots of Norman, a subtler predator but a predator nonetheless. At the first mention of his mother, his eyes turn up the hill to her, the most psychically powerful predator of all. In contrast to the retina-dominated view we have heretofore had of him, his upturned eyes now acknowledge their own master (Mother) and expose their whites\u0097the polar opposite of the policeman's absorptive black holes. (There are several other eye references in this scene. For instance, Marion mentions wishing for her own \"private island,\" a pun on the \"private eye-land\" that the Bates residence will become when Abrogast arrives.)This particular ocular motif is one of several at work during the most profoundly dissociative crisis of the film: Marion's murder. The first noteworthy shot is Marion's POV as she looks up at the projective eye of the shower (a six-foot showerhead was built to get the shot). A virtually identical shot follows her murder. But whose POV is it now?! That the POV outlasts its owner is a callous offense to be sure, one which forces the viewer, in the name of consistency, to retroactively recast the first instance as an aperspectival moment of purely aesthetic cinema. Our identification with her is retroactively denied. As we fall into the black hole of the drain\u0097which, in concert with the projective showerhead to which it cinematographically replies, constitutes a further sham logic on the director's part\u0097and then emerge from Marion's vacant retina, we are cast out of all comprehension. The ultra-close-up dismembers her face, as if unseating her very self from her eyes and draining it out her gaping mouth and nostril. It is no accident that her eye now lies an inch from the ground. Her effacement from the land of the knowable is consummated when she is swallowed down into the swamp's mammoth retina. Culminating the corruption of the height heuristic is the relegation of the final battle to the Freudian basement, rather than the Freudian attic, the latter which is understood as the true pinnacle of psychodynamic knowledge and power for several reasons, viz: (1) topologically, the attic has the highest altitude on the Bates estate; (2) historically, it bears all the artifacts of Norman's imprisoned childhood (particularly ironic is the \"Eroica\" record), the personal font of his identificatory crisis; and (3) symbolically, it represents Mother, the ultimate authority. Instead, Marion discovers the truth in the unceremonious fruit cellar! And what a truth: far from projecting from on high, Mother's eyes are instead absorptive sockets, penetrable by a mere swinging light bulb. Meanwhile, the paradoxical co-location of Norman-qua-Mother in the same room with Mother's corpse collapses the Bates family structure, necessitating Norman's exile from Eden.Hitchcock's cinematic forked tongue utters its final deception in the spurious resolution of the last shot, the excavation of Marion's car. Structurally, the shot replies to the opening (rather than swooping down, we are dragging up) and, of course, to the film's fulcrum (the submergence of the car). Has the truth been excavated? The revelations from the exhumation will prove forensic at best, and the arbiters of forensic truth\u0097the police\u0097have been shown to be so off-base that we should expect little enlightenment from them. \"Murder will out,\" we hear Chaucer groaning.

Not in Psycho which is a brilliant study of suspense, horror, paranoia, mood and evil hidden under a mask of innocence. From its very beginning to its shocking and ironic ending, we have Alfred Hitchcock directing the audience and in his own words, playing the audience \"like a piano\" \u0096 leading us exactly where he wants. To call this a chilling masterpiece is a clich\u00e9 but it is no further from the truth.The film is filled with unforgettable sequences. From Marion's (Janet Leigh) escape always with the company of the police that seems to be following her \u0096 a great way of sinking us into Marion's paranoia to her arrival at Bate's Motel where we the audience believe are safe from all danger; the conversation Marion maintains with Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) about his hobbie as a taxidermist; and of course, the shocking shower sequence. The horror of this scene comes from the fact that it takes part at a moment of extreme intimacy and vulnerability and also due to Hitchcock's craftsmanship: the screeching violin and the camera which does not focus on the wounds the stabbing causes but rather, leaves it to our imagination which is much more effective than any graphical representation. But even before we arrive at the famous Bate's Motel, where the key events take place, Psycho already feels disturbing perhaps because we fear for Crane's plight, perhaps because of the chilling score, perhaps because we fear the police's intentions, perhaps because Hitchcock gives us minimal vistas except those of suspicion therefore we feel trapped in Crane's guilt and paranoia. Whatever the reason, Psycho has already established itself as a film that is more than anything else about our paranoia and uneasy feelings.Another key element is Hitchcock's character control. We never expect the death of Marion (the film's main character) so early on. But what could have been a dangerous move is handled brilliantly as Hitchcock shifts our sympathy from Crane to Bates so that when he attempts to sink he care, we fear for him (we know that if the car does not sink we will be jabbed by fear and we also feel that Bates is too innocent a character, to suspicious a person that he would inevitably be accused of the crime if the car is discovered), just as much as we feared for Crane. The performances are worthy of mentioning especially Anthony Perkins who embodies innocence but at the same time, a disturbing presence. The ending, a close-up of Crane's assassin is chilling, highlighting this character's evil.The genius of this film is that it is always in full control of the audience, always feels visceral and chilling.

It's the story everyone knows, with innocent worker Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) running from the law with a stolen $40 000, making the mistake of checking into a certain infamous motel along the way, run by a quirky and antisocial proprietor (Anthony Perkins) and his mysterious, never seen mother. The key to Hitchcock's classic as opposed to the hundreds of generic garbage teen slasher films theaters are unfortunately bombarded with every year, is the suspense element. Hitchcock proves his genius by realizing that the key to truly inspiring fear in the hearts of an audience is by showing less rather than more. Instead of having horrendously gory deaths every 30 seconds we have a single, infamous shower stabbing, which becomes all the more chilling by how we as an audience have to essentially imagine exactly what is happening. What is truly frightening about Psycho is the eerie tension constantly building throughout the film, reaching a point of almost feeling tangible it is so vivid. This is of course helped by the truly creative and innovative camera work, representing the film's spirit of being way ahead of its time. Psycho is perhaps one of the most cleverly shot films in cinema history, which only amplifies the feeling of dread throughout, ably backed by Bernard Herrmann's chilling score.The film also boasts some rather spectacular acting, especially for its time period. Anthony Perkins is nothing less than superb in his infamous performance as the eccentric, socially awkward Norman Bates. Perkins creates a genuinely believable character, who is all the more unsettling and yet captivating by how strangely realistic as a real person he is. Janet Leigh also helps maintain the excellent tone for the movie with her iconic performance as on-the-run Marion Crane. Vera Miles also gives a strong performance as Lila, Marion's concerned sister, and Martin Balsam is great as the Detective searching for Marion.Psycho can be considered as nothing less than a classic, withstanding the test of time and coming off as just as masterfully made and honestly tense and frightening to this day.

Marion goes into her room and hears from the house, Norman and his mom arguing. then Norman comes down the hill with the food. then him and Marion have a talk, and he says his mom is bed-ridden. after their talk, Marion goes back to her cabin. moments later, she takes a shower, which turns out to be the most shooking and most effective scence in film.

But \"Psycho\" is more than Perkins' extraordinary performance and Hitchcock's masterful direction. The movie offers a great plot of mystery and horror. It all starts as a dramatic situation but turns into a story of horror and beyond reason. Marion Crane escapes from his routine life and steals $40,000 from her work in order to start a new life with her boyfriend. Marion knows it's wrong but her moral won't stop her from doing her purpose. Everything seems to work on wheels until she stops in the Bates Motel where soon she will find her cruel fate. At this point of the movie you don't expect that it will be the main character's last scene!. This is where \"Psycho\" turns into a shocking movie, and at the same time the viewer is slapped in the face by Hitchcock's unique way of creating a suspenseful/creepy atmosphere. But it's until the audience meets Norman Bates (played masterfully by Mr. Anthony Perkins) when things start to get a new point of view. The story gets rid of the angelic heroine that turned bad and now focuses on the mysterious Motel's owner. Norman seems to be a shy guy with a dark vibe that makes his presence uncomfortable. His major problem is his over-protective mother than won't allow him to do anything that she considers is against moral. As Norman talks about his mother and how he's affected by her \"madness\", the viewer can determine that he is mentally disturbed but knows perfectly how to behave. Anthony Perkins acting is terrific because he knows how to create an uncomfortable atmosphere whenever he's on screen and mainly because he seems to be the kind of guy that is silent but dangerous at the same time. This is where the real suspense of the movie begins. And after Marion's murder things seem to get out of control for people who are used to scripts that don't get out of the standards. The main character is dead by half of the movie and from then, the situations become more interesting (in the point of view of a general audience) and you don't know what's gonna happen next, not even from a guess. This 180 degree twist has to be the most important in terms of contribution to any genre (being in this situation the Horror genre). What will happen to the people trying to find Marion? what about the $40,000? Who is behind Marion's murder? And most important of all, what's behind Norman Bates' behavior? Watch \"Psycho\" in order to witness one of the most important movies of all time. Even if you don't like the Horror/Mystery genre, this movie will leave you satisfied because it offers everything a good movie needs : Good acting, masterful direction, excellent script, and a perfect score.Anthony Perkins delivers a performance that needs special mention. The man knows how to portray a psycho like no other can. Thank you Mr. Perkins for the performance that most people respect in the genre. Janet Leigh also delivers a believable performance. She showed that she is a great actress. The death scenes are beyond great this time. You don't see coming Mother ! whenever she raises the knife! Excellent scenes. Always copied, never matched. Also, the score deserves a honorable mention. This is probably the best score in any Horror film! Followed by Carpenter's in \"Halloweeen\" maybe. Please, do yourself a favor and watch this movie in order to witness why this is the most influential movie of all time. The story is excellent and it's backed by solid acting and a wonderful direction by the master of all; Alfred Hitchcock.The shower scene is one of the most important scenes of all time, not to mention the shocking ending.

The key to \"Psycho\" is that it came out nearly 50 years ago and while viewing the film one should keep this in mind. Most of the surprises and tricks we take for granted today were at one point something totally new and different. Writers so often steal and copy ideas from others that everything becomes predictable--in fact, that is the major problem with today's horror flick: the viewer knows exactly what is going to happen. However, \"Psycho\" is sort of a first cause, it's a film that stole nothing yet inspired everything. Of course, to watch the \"Psycho\" in this day and age isn't nearly as exciting as it would have been back in 1960. But as I stated, in order to truly appreciate Hitchcock's genius one has to put himself back in a theatre during \"Psycho's\" release.The film begins with a young woman, Marion Crane (Leigh). She seems like a respectable girl, but she soon falls to temptation and steals forty thousand dollars from her employer. After this she immediately leaves town and heads towards California. Before she reaches her destination she must first take a night's rest at a roadside motel, the Bates Motel, and here begins our descent into the darkness. At the dilapidated motel, Marion meets the owner, Norman Bates (played brilliantly by Anthony Perkins), and they even have a nice dinner together. Hitchcock has set up the perfect thriller; he dupes us into believing this film is now going to somehow center on Marion and Norman, and in a way it does, but not in the way we anticipate. Hitch starts this film as a classic \"cat and mouse\" game: girl steal money, cops try to get money back. But all of our expectations are shattered as Marion is brutally stabbed to death while she is taking a shower in her motel room. We even discover that the perpetrator is Norman's crazy mother.Marion may be dead, but her crime is well enough alive. A private investigator (Martin Balsam) (hired by Marion's sister and boyfriend)is on her tail, and traces her to the Bates motel. He too meets and untimely death, and once again we are astounded. Hitchcock not only killed his main character, but now he has killed a cop. We are held in complete suspense; we know that Hitch is not afraid to kill anyone, and that means anything can happen. This is the kind of remarkable and groundbreaking stuff I was talking about. No other director before Hitchcock was as brazen as to knock off the female lead (and certainly not while she was naked in the shower). Could you imagine seeing this for the first time?Soon enough Marion's sister (Vera Miles) and boyfriend (John Gavin) decide to go find her themselves. They want to convince Marion to turn herself in so she may receive a lesser penalty for her crime. Right before the private investigator was murdered by Momma Bates, he told them that he had traced Marion to the Bates Motel, and thus the two of them head off to the hellhole. Shortly after this point the film ends, and what an end it is! Hitchcock has set us up for one of the most suspenseful, disturbing, and surprising conclusions in cinematic history. I can only imagine how incredible this experience would have been back in 1960, but alas, \"Psycho's\" ending is hardly a secret anymore and some of its more shocking moments are not nearly as jaw-dropping in this modern age. However, that doesn't change the fact that \"Psycho\" spawned the modern horror genre and gave us some of Hitchcock's best cinematography.We have been exposed to almost fifty years of copycats since \"Psycho\" and because of this I think we have forgotten just how amazing the original was. It is like living in Arizona: one sees the sun so often he forgets how glorious it was when he first moved there. So yes, \"Pyscho\" may seem a bit dated, but that isn't the films fault; that is our fault--we have seen to many duplicates. I will also admit that \"Pyscho\" doesn't really have much of a message (well, unless one counts the film's brief mention of how people create \"traps\" for themselves). However, this movie's goal is not to preach, but to scare and surprise, and I believe it succeeds wonderfully in this area (so long as we can imagine ourselves in a 1960's theatre). \"Pyscho\" is not only a part of American culture, but a milestone in American film-making, and probably Hitchcock's greatest achievement. For all these reasons and them some, I give \"Psycho\": 5 out of 5 stars.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Psycho (5/5 stars)", "date": "2006-01-21T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1271428", "sentiment score": [0.0336, 0.1593, 0.3548, 0.3903, 0.062]}, {"content": "Psycho is, without a doubt, one of the best thrillers of all time. here is a quick review.

The result was \"Psycho\".Loosely based on Robert Bloch's novel of the same name, \"Psycho\" is a superbly done film in almost every aspect, and shows the perfection of Hitchcock's technique. The Master was at that time at the peak of his art.Scripwriter Joseph Stefano makes a different take on Bloch's novel and tells the story of Marion Crane, a woman who in an impulsive act steals $40 thousand dollars from her boss; in her escape, she spends the night at the Bates Motel, only to discover the dark secret that hides the owners, Norman Bates and his mother.Done with a budget of $800,000, \"Psycho\" is perfectly conceived as it never goes too far from what it pretends to do. Hitchcock worked closely to Stefano in order to know exactly what type of take he was going to do.Filmed in Black and White in a time when color was already the dominant format, the sharp contrast between light and darkness is a beautiful remark of what lies hidden inside Bates Motel.Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, Marion and Norman respectively, give an outstanding performance in their roles. Perkins clearly dominates the character of Norman and it is obvious why was he type-casted as Bates, his performance and the character is so well developed by the script that is impossible to not feel empathy for him.Many words could be written about Psycho, but all that must be said is that this film shows what film-making is about.

We watch him as he begins to unravel when confronted first by Arbogast, and then by Sam Loomis. Mr. Perkins' performance is one of the best he ever gave in his film career.Janet Leigh who plays Marion Crane is perfect as the small would be criminal who happens to be in the wrong place, at the wrong time. It's a tribute to Ms. Leigh's talent that she underplays Marion because she is battling with her own conscience as she realizes the enormity of what she has done.

Having just watched this film again in honor of Halloween weekend, I was struck fresh by the movie's frankness, which had to have been beyond uncomfortable for film audiences at the time. Supposedly film executives on screening this film were shocked more than anything else by the shots of the toilet in the hotel bathroom. If that was enough to shock, then what about references to transvestites, sexual arousal and release, and the blood-splattered bathroom that Hitchcock shows Perkins cleaning up in rigorous detail? The movie is so honest about the human body, its more unpleasant urges and physical qualities, that when the camera follows a swirl of blood down the shower drain, you half expect to see a big clump of hair sticking out of it. And to think this film came out at the same time as Douglas Sirk was making his films, in which women are as carefully painted and polished as china dolls.The true test of a great film is how well it stands up to the test of time, and whether or not you can revisit it and find something new in it each time you do so.

Maybe it will shock you beyond belief. Or, it could make you weep. These are all reasons to love movies. But, what really makes a movie great is the fact that it has more than just on good point. Psycho has many great points.1) The story takes many twists and turns. It seems to change a bit after every set of minutes. The ending is the biggest twist of all. Psycho is nearly unpredictable.2) Perkins performance alone is deserving of an Oscar. We see him twitch and tremble as Arbogast interviews him. He slowly becomes mistrustful and dramatic as he talks with Marion. Anthony Perkin's performance in here deserves to be ranked among the \"Best Male Performances of All Time!\" along with Tom Hanks in Forrest Gump and Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs.3) Hitchcock knew how to work a camera! His creative style brings the film to life. He films on top of the car hood to see Marion and her stalker in the beginning. The camera spirals backwards, using Marion's eye as the starting point after the shower scene. During the staircase scene, there is a stunning bird's eye view so we can see the killer and Arbogast.4) The dialogue is fun and smart. How unforgettable is \"We all go a little mad sometimes\"? It will keep you entertained and thrilled to hear. Even if the film is full of dialogue, it manages to keep you interested.5) Do you know how much Hitchcock worked on this film? I heard the shower scene took days to film! Think about all those shots! Good thing it was all worth it, because the shower scene is one of the best parts of the film.6) Another small, but genius part in Psycho was the part in the cellar. Lila Crane accidentally falls backwards and hits the light bulb, causing it to swing back and forth, to create a spectacular lighting effect.7) The musical score is one-of-a-kind. I hear it re-playing in my head all the time. It's often parodied in shows and other movies. But, don't listen to them. The best music is in the opening credits.8) The murder scenes are visually fantastic. The staircase scene brings sickening pleasure to the mind.9) The voices we hear when Marion is driving away explain what's happening back at her hometown. This saves screen time and allows the story to continue without wasting precious time.10) The \"main character\" Marion is killed off right after the infamous shower scene. I guess she really isn't the main character, (Norman is.) but it makes a fun twist, and the story still continues to flow.Multiple things like this define a movie. So what if it isn't scary?

Unusual in itself, since I was in 10th grade and cannot remember EVER attending another film with Mom. Neither of us had any idea what we were in for.The audience was seated (as contractually required by Hitchcock) before the lights went down. The theatre was pitch black except for the small \"Exit\" lights. So effective was Hitchcock's pre-publicity for \"Psycho\" that everybody was already nervous: all we knew was that \"Psycho\" was going to be \"shocking.\" Suddenly, out of the darkness, Bernard Herrmann's immediately nerve-jangling score attacked and the massive curtains slowly opened in front of the screen. \"Uh-oh,\" I recall thinking. No one had ever heard a score like this.Once the title and credits ended and the quiet pan across Phoenix's skyline began, I relaxed -- but only briefly. For here we were peering into a hotel window where the magnificently endowed Janet Leigh (in a bra and half slip) and a shirtless John Gavin were concluding their lunchtime tryst. Not the scene I would have chosen to be sitting next to my Mother for.By the time the shower sequence stunned everybody, I can still remember my Mother squirming audibly and uncomfortably next to me with every stab.Happily, she and I had a healthy relationship. Walking out after the lights came up, we were as silent as everybody else until we hit the sidewalk and daylight. She shook her head: \"What did you think of THAT?\" \"Damndest thing I ever saw!\" She agreed.It would be 13 years later, after I'd moved to Los Angeles and was writing for films and television, before I attended another opening that had an equally jolting impact on the public: \"The Exorcist.\" I can't add anything to the comments already made about \"Psycho's\" technique and brilliance -- except perhaps to point out its film-making economy, still endlessly studied in film schools around the world.Try this: shut off the sound. \"Psycho\" STILL plays, coherently, as a maniacal SILENT FILM study of a psychopath.One shot in particular still haunts me for its storytelling simplicity. It's certainly not the most \"spectacular\" sequence in \"Psycho,\" yet its meticulous planning and perfect placement say perhaps as much about Hitchcock's command of film as anything else in his long career.After Marion Crane's brutal murder, and the camera pulls back from her lifeless eye, the camera moves out of the brightly lit bathroom over the sound of still-running water, across her empty motel room, past the rolled-up newspaper (containing the $40,000) on the nightstand, to the open window and the Bates house on the hill, where Norman is heard shrieking, \"Mother! Oh, God! Blood! Blood!\" After the assaultive flash-cuts of butchery (and the screeching violins of Herrmann's score, and the stabbing sounds) we've just witnessed . . . we're given a chance to catch our breaths over the near-silent sound of the shower. \"What on earth can happen NEXT?\" The lead character is dead.In this brief, quiet coda to one of the most electrifying sequences in film history, Hitchcock \"lets\" us recover . . . sort of. In fact, the camera's simple movement re-establishes the entire story arc of \"Psycho's\" first third, backwards from the murder to the reminder that Marion's stolen cash has led us here and lies in plain sight, waiting to be discovered, then forward in time again to the unknown horror on the hill. (The seemingly simple shot of the house through the window is actually a rather elaborate process shot that itself involves several elements, including that menacing sky.)Equally remarkable, Bernard Herrmann's disturbing score. If you can find it and listen to it apart from the picture, you'll appreciate its demented insect-like constantly unnerving, web-spinning, unsettling, biting, frightening power.Shockingly, Herrmann's score occupies barely thirty-minutes of the total screen time. Yet it's unforgettable.Here is a film, and a director, that is as effective and appreciated over 45 years later as it was the day of its release. Costing under a million dollars, it will retain its position as one of the finest, most visceral suspense films ever made . . . long after Spielberg's (another fine director) heartless, emotionless, expensive special-effects extravaganza, \"War of the Worlds,\" has been forgotten (if it's not already).", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Original Release . . .", "date": "2005-10-24T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1200733", "sentiment score": [0.1928, 0.3085, 0.1451, 0.215, 0.1386]}, {"content": "The movie is very good Anthony Perkins is so hot he's really a good actor boy he's handsome Vera Miles is freaking hot also!

I love all types: drama, comedy, action, sci-fi, foreign and horror. But I would have to say that my favorite genre is suspense. Something about thrilling audiences without the use of special effects, and creating realistic settings which cause a sense of dread for the audience. And nobody, in my opinion, accomplished this with a greater sense of style, polish, and dignity than Alfred Hitchcock. His films are full of great dialog, well-rounded characters, and genuine and original shocks.Of all of his films, my favorite would have to be \"Psycho\". This masterpiece uses amazing black and white cinematography and a very low bodycount (yes, that's correct, a very low bodycount) to weave a fascinating story of a woman caught in a criminal web of her own doing who stops off at the wrong motel on a wet and rainy night. She meets the inn-keeper, a fragile and soft spoken young man who is emotionally and verbally pushed around by his overbearing mother.What follows is a tension filled and horrifying tale of psychological suspense. I have heard others comment that this film is not really \"scary\", and I beg to differ. Nothing to me could be more terrifying than the reality that people like some of those presented in this film truly exist in our world. It takes a lot more than fake blood and overly-gory special effects to impress me, and the sad thing is that today's \"horror\" films and even some claiming to be suspense films rely too much on the supernatural or just plain disgusting to achieve their affect. None of that for me thanks.One of my true pleasures is to see someone view this film for the first time. Moments in the film tend to shock or surprise people who think they've seen it all. Those who have seen enough knock-offs (and there are a TON of them) may figure out some of the story's plot before it is revealed, but only because so many films have shamelessly ripped this one off.

What can be said that hasn't already been said? And how can I write a glowing review that offers up genuine love and appreciation for the film, and not just regurgitate some propaganda that Psycho is the greatest slasher ever made? Well, here goes nothing . . .From imitation and its popularity among film scholars and horror buffs, Psycho has no more surprises left \u0096 that's a given. However, Sir Alfred Hitchcock foresaw this problem and infused Psycho (as well as his other pictures) with the more effective element: suspense. We know where, why, and when the murders take place. So what? The key to Hitchcock's famous bomb analogy is that suspense comes from the audience's knowledge of the bomb, not a lack of knowledge. We know, but the characters do not. That's suspense.I watched Psycho again just recently, and felt an unprecedented excitement as those famous Bernard Herrmann strings began playing and Saul Bass' credits filled the screen. I was watching one of my favorite movies again, and I couldn't wait to dive into the film, itself. I couldn't wait for that opening shot of Phoenix \u0096 I looked forward to seeing that look of horror on Marion Crane's face as her bosses crosses the street in front of her car while she's escaping to Fairvale. I wanted to see Anthony Perkins to appear on screen with his brilliantly subdued performance of Norman Bates, and I leaned closer to the screen and smiled when he says, \"We all go a little crazy sometimes.\" Needless to say, I love this movie.What amazes me about Psycho, and I didn't consciously realize this until reading the Truffaut book \"Hitchcock\", is how the film manages to smoothly switch protagonists midway through the film (from Marion to Norman). As Hitchcock and Truffaut talk in the book, when the car is pushed into the swamp and it stops \u0096 the audience's heart stops. We want the car to sink, and we want Norman to succeed. More amazingly is how even after knowing all the revelations the film has to offer \u0096 the truth about Norman Bates and his mother \u0096 we still want that car to sink. We still sympathize with Norman Bates in that moment.That, in my opinion, is what truly separates Hitchcock's Psycho from the pack. Sir Alfred actually made us care about his killer. I can't think of any other slasher film that attempts this and succeeds. Most slashers are content to have a killing machine under a mask, but only Hitchcock has the balls to show us the face of his killer. Only Hitchcock would dare to make his killer a full-fledged characters with intelligent thoughts and complex emotions, and only Hitchcock was good enough to pull it off.As if that's not enough, in the final act Hitch plays the audience like an organ and switches our sympathies once again (from Norman to Lila) \u0096 and all the while, the audience never really consciously recognizes that their loyalties fly from character to character on a whim. We want Marion to succeed because the man she's stealing from is a prick, we want Norman to succeed because of the love for his mother and his humanness in reacting to the murder, and we want Lila to succeed because we want to know the truth behind Norman Bates' mother.One of my favorite moments in all of cinema occurs in Psycho. Watch the film while Sam Loomis is searching and calling out for Detective Arbogast at the Bates' motel. Then Hitch cuts to a slow fluid push in on Anthony Perkins at the swamp, and Perkins looks up at the camera with a mixture of emotions in his eyes. It's one of the simplest camera movements in the film. Perkins doesn't say a word - he just quietly looks on. Yet it's one of the most effective shots in the entire film. A simple movement and silent look is all Hitchcock needs.When the marketing gimmicks have all been forgotten, when all the surprises are known, and when imitators have sucked away and blatantly stolen whatever they can get to work for 45 years, Psycho still stands as solid as ever. It did not need the shock of killing its star, nor did it need the shocking revelation at the end, it didn't need the gimmick that \"audiences won't be admitted after the start of the picture.\" Psycho works just as well without them because Hitchcock delivered great characters played by competent actors, and he let the audience know there's a bomb waiting to go off that none of those characters know about.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 4, "votes": 5}, "heading": "Pure Cinema", "date": "2005-10-14T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1193723", "sentiment score": [0.1523, 0.276, 0.2063, 0.2289, 0.1366]}, {"content": "\"Psycho\" is the most astounding, daring, and successful scary film ever made...

Psycho is the film that inspired the entire 'slasher' sub-genre, and is also a textbook example of how to make a thriller. Every shot in the film is perfectly orchestrated, and by keeping the immediate action simple; the master director is able to fully focus on the proceedings, making the resulting film more thrilling. The influence that Psycho has had on cinema overall is astounding, and it's hard to imagine cinema now without this film. The fact that over forty years on, Psycho is still better than every film it influenced is no coincidence. The plot follows Marion Crane; an office worker who is entrusted with $40,000. Seeing her chance to escape her mundane life, she takes the money and runs. Unluckily for her, she stops at a small roadside motel; The Bates Motel. Managed by a quiet young man named Norman, the remote motel has more secrets than it's appearance suggests.Alfred Hitchcock creates a superb macabre atmosphere around the central location. Just the motel itself is frightening, without the rain effects and the psychopath that inhabits it. The master director has proved time and time again that he knows how to handle a movie; and the way that he orchestrates the surrounding here shows that implicitly. Everything about the plot is well worked, and the twist right at the centre of the film shows that. It's hard to carry off a twist like the one here and make it work, as the audience have put so much time and effort into the central character; but Hitchcock is more than equal to the challenge, and the way that he shifts the focus and still manages to retain all the intrigue is awesome to watch. The pivotal scene of the movie is, of course, the shower scene. The technicalities of this scene warrant the seven days that it took to film it, and the resulting montage represents some of the best footage ever to come out of Hollywood. I don't subscribe to the idea of 'less is more' usually, but the shower scene is so skilfully done that it's hard to not respect it.The central character of Norman Bates is, without doubt, one of the most frightening characters in cinema history. Unlike many of the resulting slashers' killers, Norman isn't overblown or even unrealistic; you can really imagine this character being real. Of course, the excellent performance by Anthony Perkins really adds to the character. There are some actors that were made by one role, and Perkins is one of them. The rest of the ensemble work brilliantly together, with Janet Leigh providing the central character until mid-way through, when Vera Miles steps in. It's a shame, really, that Psycho is so well known because now everyone knows it's twist, so it's hard to really enjoy the movie the way that it's intended. I knew the twist already before I saw the film for the first time - so it's lucky that the movie is so good, because otherwise, already knowing what happens could have spoilt it. Overall, there's a very good reason why Psycho is one of the most respected movies of all time. There are some films that you cant be a cinema fan without seeing - and this is one of them.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 7}, "heading": "The master director's most important film?", "date": "2005-10-07T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1188355", "sentiment score": [0.0092, 0.0942, 0.3483, 0.4857, 0.0627]}, {"content": "Alfred Hitchcock's 'Psycho' is arguably one of the most classic horror movies ever made. A great deal of iconography associated with the horror genre these days, for example eerie orchestral soundtracks and use of shadows and simplicity, appear to have originated in this movie.The narrative follows Marion, a young female secretary, who steals a large sum of money from her employer and runs away with the intent of building a new life with her lover. On her journey to her boyfriend's place of work, however, she decides against this action but as it is too dark to either go home or continue the journey she stops to spend the night at a motel. Namely the 'Bates Motel'... Many of the scenes that follow have become infamous in the world of cinema. When Marion is being shown to be stabbed in the shower very little is seen of the murderer and there is very little noticeable blood. Hitchcock clearly knew the way in which to create real horror is through what is NOT seen. Audiences' imaginations tend to scare them the most. The film continues to scare the audiences until the very last scene, which is unusual for a horror film. In typical, mediocre, horror films a new equilibrium is usually created and the horror dead or over. But although the film does typically end on a note of normality (albeit with characters having been murdered) Norman Bates is still alive and as creepy as ever, if not more than to begin with. The film works on a number of levels. It fulfils many different categories of horror, in the sense that it displays blood and murder, but also has psychological disturbances and thriller tendencies. It has continued to scare from the sixties to the present day and i am sure it will carry on scaring future generations to come. I am currently making a Horror Film Trailer for A Level Coursework and will try to feature many ideas from this film in my project!

Unable to continue to drive in a blinding thunderstorm, she loses her way off the main road and ends up having to spend the night at the Bates Motel.The infamous shower scene has been talked about ever since it scared the heck out of everyone who saw it and some women were so frightened they couldn't take a shower for days afterward. Even after all these years there are still some people who haven't seen this film and refuse to see it.The house behind the motel where Norman lives with his mother is a masterpiece of set design built at 3/4 scale to make it look more ominous, and it sure does look ominous. Anthony Perkins is totally convincing as the loner mama's boy.The movie was filmed by a TV crew in black and white which was a total departure from Hitchcock's widescreen VistaVision color films such as Vertigo. This is a movie that you can see many times and always take away something new. Once again Hitchcock creates a film that can be read on different levels.

He tells the story with lots of almost poetic like style of directing. There are many sequences that I truly regard as classic and renewing for the genre and no, I am not just only talking about the famous shower-scene. Also the role the characters play in the movie is really done superb. I mean, the character who we'll all think will be the hero and main character in the beginning, gets killed half way through the movie, how brilliant is that? This movie opened the door for more adult horror with layers. Before this most horror movies were movies with a supernatural story and monsters in it. This is one of the most important movies that made horror movies what they are today.Another factor that makes this movie a classic is the 'villain' played by Anthony Perkins. He plays a truly chilling psychopath what makes his character a truly classic one.Also the musical score only consisting out of stringed instruments by Bernard Hermann is a real classic. Most people will probably only remember the music used during the famous shower-scene, a shame because the rest of the score is also magnificent and deserves to be heard by everyone.

What can anyone say? Psycho is the greatest horror/suspense film classic of all time. Mr. Hitchcock, the master of suspense, gave 1960 audiences, a film they would never forget. And the film started an industry of slasher films. I don't even know if the master knew the impact it would have in film history.Most of you reading this have seen the film, know the plot, and the surprise ending. So I won't bore you all with going over all of it. What I want to do is go over some of my personal feelings about the film, and my reaction when I first saw it on video, in the 80's. I was only a teen, but enjoyed classic movies. Especially this one.WARNING AGAIN-SPOILERS, for anyone out there that have not been lucky enough to see this masterpiece.The shower scene. I remember seeing the figure beyond the curtain, slowly move in. I put myself in the mind frame of a 1960 audience. When that shower curtain was pulled aside, and the figure appeared, along with the screeching music, I was terrified, but could not take my eyes of the screen. How brilliant was Hitchcock? To have his leading lady, star of the film, stabbed to death in the first 40 minutes of the movie. This left us, not knowing what to expect next. Anything could happen now. And a piece of info I learned on the shower scene. With all the brilliant editing, it had always been said, that the knife NEVER touched Marion's flesh. As I studied the scene in slow motion and frame by frame viewing, I found something. There's a shot of the knife going into the stomach of Marion. As I went frame by frame, I found, not only does the knife touch her stomach, but the tip of the knife penetrates the flesh. You can only see this if you have a VCR or DVD player, that can go frame by frame. Try it sometime.Arbogast- The murder of investigator, Arbogast, almost gave me a heart attack. I thought he'd creep into the house, maybe get some answers from Mrs. Bates, etc. But I guess I need not say what happens when he reaches the top of the stairs. My dad told me how he saw Psycho in the theater, when he was a teen in 1960. He said the Arbogast murder made him jump out of his seat, with his heart racing for the next five minutes. He says it was the biggest scare of any movie he's ever seen. I agree.Lila and Norman- This time I thought I had it figured out. Lila would get to Mrs. Bates, and get some answers. Wrong. When Lila goes down to the fruit celler, and finds the dead Mrs. Bates, chills ran through me. But then when Norman appears, dressed as his mother, with the insane look in his eyes, I got more chills than the flu. It finally sunk in. It all came together. That's what makes the film even more frightening to watch now. To know what went on in that old house, overlooking the motel. The madness, the horror, the evil. That's what went on in that house, years before Marion Crane stopped for the night. Pure madness. Pure evil. Pure insanity.Well, that's about it on my comments. The film is the greatest horror/suspense classic ever made. If you haven't seen it for a while, set aside a night, and watch it again.

One Friday a man comes into her real estate office with $40,000 in cash to purchase a house for his daughter. Instead of taking the money to the bank as her boss directed, Marion packs her bags and leaves town with the money, presumably to give to Sam so they can finally make a life together. After driving for a day and a half, she ends up stopping at a motel only 10 miles from Sam's home. The Bates Motel, operated by one Norman Bates (Perkins) is a creepy place shrouded with mystery, particularly the mystery that is Norman's mother, a driving force that looms over the property and controls Norman himself. When Marion does not show up for work on Monday, her sister Lila (Miles) comes looking for her as well as a detective, Arbogast (Balsam) hired by Marion's employer. Unfortunately they all find that as one mystery begins to unravel, another one, more quizzical and shocking is ready to take its place, and none of them are safe from the danger of the Bates Motel.I'm pretty sure that there isn't much more to say about this film that hasn't already been said; \"Psycho\" being one of the most studied and analyzed films in film history. (I myself took a class in college that examined parts of the film frame by frame, and have read books analyzing the film) However, I have to wonder if the sensation of the film and the fact that it is an instant classic, regardless if someone has seen it or not (truthfully, I have heard people say, \"Oh, that is such a classic.\" And then later admit that they haven't yet seen the film at all.), sometimes waters down its mastery and the impact this film had (and continues to have) on the film industry as a whole. If you ever get the opportunity to see the art exhibit \"24 Hour Psycho\", wherein the artist slows the film down to make the running time span an entire day, or if you were to read the excellent book Shower Scene in Hitchcock's Psycho: Creating Cinematic Suspense and Terror by Philip J. Skerry, you can see how incredibly impeccable each frame of the film is. If you were to lay out any scene in the film and look at it frame by frame, you would have some incredibly compelling photographs, and that was exactly how Hitchcock intended his presentation to be.Aside from being a work of art, it is well known that \"Psycho\" changed the way that moviegoers attended the cinema. Because of the big event that occurs halfway through the film, Hitchcock could not have people continuing their normal practice of strolling into the theater whenever they felt like it. If any of these people came to see a Janet Leigh picture, they would be pretty confused at that point. So Hitchcock, ever the showman (and his own greatest publicist) announced that no one would be admitted into the theater after the movie began. This was HUGE for its time. Besides changing the attendance factor, it was one of the greatest publicity stunts of its time. If people weren't going to go to the film before, they sure were going to check it out now. I'm sure that \"Psycho\" doesn't have as much of an impact to people who grew up on slasher films or other horror films, but despite the fact it was released 45 years ago, its secrets are now the stuff of general film knowledge, and personally, the fact that I have studied it clinically, when I went to see it at the classic movie house two weeks ago, I still found that my heart was racing and the hair was standing up on my arms during the very last scene of the film. Even more of a testimony to its impact is the fact that a friend that I attended the film with, who isn't much of a film fan, much less a classic film buff not only said that he was so tense during the film that he was on pins and needles, but that he wanted to see it again, and soon. Why does this film have such a forceful impact nearly five decades after it was first released? I'm sure that one of the several hundred books written about this film and Hitchcock's filmography could give you several reasons at length.

For starters, when Marion and Norman first meet, you can see Norman's reflection in the window, as if there's two of him. When Marion and Norman are eating dinner in the room with the stuffed birds, you can see that some of the birds are positioned so that their beaks look almost as if they're pecking at both Marion and Norman; something is eating at Norman, and we get to see a premonition of Marion's impending fate. When Norman looks through the hole (which incidentally is behind a picture of two people attacking a woman), we get a POV shot; when Marion is in the shower, we get a POV shot. When Norman pushes Marion's car into the swamp, half of his face is in a shadow, as if he has two sides.On the subject of those birds, there are several references to birds throughout the movie: Marion's last name is Crane, she comes from Phoenix, and finally, the stuffed birds. The truth is, Hitchcock had a keen interest in avians; in \"Sabotage\", a woman finds her strength after watching \"Who Killed Cock Robin?\", then the bird references in \"Psycho\", and finally, the ornithological uprising in \"The Birds\". Speaking of the characters' names, there's Crane (a bird), Bates (bait), Loomis (gloom), and Arbogast (aghast).Another thing that Hitch does in this movie is play with the audience. First, the movie focuses on Marion. When she steals the money, you're not sure whether to root for her, because she is the main character and you want her to succeed, but do you want her to steal? Then, the movie focuses on Norman. When he hides Marion's murder, you want him to succeed, but succeed in hiding a murder? Finally, the focus shifts to Lila.Everyone remembers the shower scene, but what does it mean? It seems as though Marion, by flushing the paper down the toilet, was washing away her misdeeds, and taking a shower consecrated that.The dialogue is of course a key part. Obviously, \"Mother...what's the phrase...isn't quite herself today.\" and \"A boy's best friend is his mother.\" are premonitions, but there are others. In the discussion of institutions, Norman talks about \"...the cruel eyes studying you.\" Then, when he looks through the hole, his eyes study Marion. At the end, you might say that there are three explanations: first, the bombastic psychiatrist explains Norman's mental state; then, \"mother\" describes how her son is guilty; and finally, the car is towed out of the swamp, as though they have dug into the putridity of Norman's mind. They have penetrated Norman's mind, just like the knives penetrated Marion's and Arbogast's bodies.On the DVD, you should watch the original trailer, which has Hitch showing us around the motel and house. He was really playing with the audience there. First off, he looked into a toilet. No movie had ever portrayed a toilet (but everyone knew why toilets existed), so what must the audience have thought about that? Also, he looks in a closet, looks surprised, and closes the closet. Did he see something in there?

Sure, in the sixties, this must have caused a lot of nightmares, but we are used to a lot more nowadays. Still, that doesn't mean that this movie isn't worth watching anymore. It certainly is, I would even say more: this should be seen by everybody who is at least a little bit interested in movies...Marion Crane, working in a real estate office, hasn't had too much luck in life so far. She only sees her fianc\u00e9 Sam during her lunch breaks and they can't get married because they don't have enough money. Sam is divorced and still has to pay off his ex-wife's alimony. She feels like she is stuck in a situation she can't get out of, but then she gets a golden opportunity. When Mr. Cassidy, a rich oil tycoon, comes to the office to give $40,000 in cash to buy a house for his daughter's wedding present, Marion is trusted by her boss to bring the money to the bank. But instead of bringing it to the bank, she takes the money to start a new life. She packs up and heads for Fairvale to see Sam, but when the night falls, she ends up at the Bates Motel where she meets Norman Bates. Norman is a nice young man, but he seems to be obsessed with his mother. After lunch, Marion returns to her room where she will take a shower, the last thing that she will do in her life...As I said before, if you think this will be a horror movie like you are used to see, than you'll be disappointed.

The script for this movie is absolutely brilliant and the plot twist is timed perfectly. But \"Psycho\" is not only a masterpiece thanks to the story. The acting and the camera-work are at least as memorable. While all actors did a very fine job, it is Anthony Perkins who was the most perfect one of them all. Somehow he doesn't give the impression of playing his role, it's like the actor and the character have become one in this movie. Believe me, that's something you will not find very often. The same for the camera-work. Hitchcock understands the art (and you can take that word quite literally) of not showing everything and still making you understand what exactly is going on. There is only one other director who I know off that was also able to say so much with so little and who knew so well how to work with close-ups and that's Sergio Leone (Not that I'm comparing both men with each other, because the movies that they made couldn't be compared either, but in my opinion these are the two best directors ever).I really could go on for hours about this movie, but I believe that it is impossible to completely describe what this movie does to you.

More than forty years later, the movie's fame is such that even those who have not seen it are often able to sketch the basic outline of the story in a few words. This demonstrates the film's fame; what demonstrates it quality, however, is the fact that even those who know the plot before seeing it are seldom disappointed.Very loosely based on Robert Bloch's pulp novel, which was itself very loosely based on killer Ed Gein, PSYCHO presents us with the tale of Marion Crane (Janet Leigh)--who, in a moment of madness, steals forty-thousand dollars. Running scared, Marion checks into the out-of-the-way Bates Motel. And there, as production notes for the recent DVD release gracefully state, she becomes the most grossly inconvenienced hotel guest in cinema history.The late 1950s and early 1960s saw a deluge of low budget and badly made films that commanded box office business via tawdry subject matter, and according to lore director Alfred Hitchcock was curious to see what might happen if he himself made such a film--but made it well. Working with a remarkable script and gifted cast and crew, the result was a masterpiece. Although it is often described as a horror film, PSYCHO is less horror than it is a study in paranoia and suspense, and certainly a lesson in the fact that one need not bother with graphic gore or big budgets to impress audiences.Much of the film's success is in its detail. Joseph Stephano's script is memorable for its repetition of verbal motifs and its extremely disquieting tone; Bernard Herrman's famous all-strings score builds tremendously upon it. The simple yet meticulous sets communicate building unease, and the strangely flat, semi-documentary black and white cinematography has a voyeuristic edge that is extremely disturbing.There are elements that can be justly criticized--moments at which the script sounds a false note or characterizations seem a bit artificial--but these small points fade against the overall power of Hitchcock's vision, a vision that here makes viewers squirm even when there seems nothing tangible on screen to squirm about. But in the end, this is the film for which Janet Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, and John Gavin will forever be remembered... and one of the several films that will forever be associated with one of the twentieth century's most masterful directors.Gary F.

The shower is in the Bates motel, run by Norman Bates, and his 'mother'. Even today, if someone looks freaky, many still say he looks like Norman Bates. If someone has a clingy or naggy mother, many a Norman Bates allusion is referred to. Psycho has become etched into modern culture and become a household name. Why?...because the film was a milestone, not just of gore, but of cinematic effect and technique. Psycho is, all at the same time, taut, mesmerising and terrifying. It is a textbook example of how to captivate an audience, and then shock them right at the very end.The film starts by introducing a love-lorn and frustrated heroine, complete with a dead-end job, and a relationship that needs a jump start. The audience is introduced to her and her troubles; we follow her, and feel for her - then she is murdered right in front of us. The array of characters introduced in the first half of the film - the arrogant 'Texan' guy who flashes forty thousand dollars, the bumbling boss, the suspicious highway cop, the dumbfounded used-car salesman - all amount to nothing. This pioneering change in plot has the same effect as a tree which you collide with after pulling up the handbrake on a speeding car.Then enter Milton Arbogast, the private detective who begins the search for our slain heroin Marion Crane. He investigates the Bates Motel and finds something amiss. He reports the news to the worried boyfriend and sister of Ms Crane - they all develop some trust and repartee. Then he's dead. Then enter the local town cop who doesn't believe the boyfriend's and the sister's suspicions, while all the time the audience knows what really happened and why people are dying at the hands of an 'evil old lady' who the disturbed Norman Bates is desperate to protect.The whole film was a totally new way of writing a plot, and of manipulating a storyline. The supposed lead character is killed early on, a replacement protagonist suffers the same fate; and all the audience are then left with are the utterly desperate and confused Lila Crane (sister) and Sam Loomis (boyfriend), who have only their suspicions and fear to drive them toward finding the truth. The audience feels for them, because we know that Norman's mother murdered Marion Crane.....or at least we think we do.Psycho only runs for around an hour and a half. It is the tautest thriller I've ever seen. Not one scene is wasted on being filler. Each scene is purposeful, powerful, and extremely economical. The pace is cracking when it needs to be, and slow and hypnotic when emotion and fear need to be emphasised; note the long scene as Norman Bates cleans up the murder scene - this allows the horror of what just happen sink in.The script is rattling, with some flourishing dialogue that even overshadows some wooden acting from John Gavin. The cinematography is brilliant, with great use of lighting and shadows. And, of course, the directing is just simply cutting edge, even for today. Anthony Perkins does a perfectly chilling job as the psychotic Norman Bates, and Martin Balsam is a completely natural private eye. And famously, to complement these ground-breaking plot twists, are the chilling and perfectly executed murder scenes.And finally, the chilling revelation of what really happened at the Bates Motel is kept right until the blood-curdling end, and is realised through a ear-splitting scream, a rotting skull, and a naked swinging lightbulb; a scene which leaves the audience shocked, terrified and thrilled after such a roller-coaster of a movie. For those few people to whom the 'spoliers' warning at the start of this piece applies, go and rent this film. It is simply a must for everyone. It is a defining moment of modern popular culture, and as such if there ever was a convincing candidate for the greatest movie ever made title, well then this is it.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 7, "votes": 10}, "heading": "If there is one single film that can claim to be THE best of all time, then this is it....", "date": "2005-03-06T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1034606", "sentiment score": [0.0795, 0.2609, 0.3491, 0.2592, 0.0513]}, {"content": "This film is the most famous of all the films by Oscar nominated director Sir Alfred Hitchcock, unfortunately Rebecca was the most popular of his films, according to cinema tickets.

The build-up of Leigh's character being washed from existence doesn't become boring to me after multiple viewings. It's a Hitchcock movie. His style of filming leaves so much beauty to look at before the horror begins here. I found myself wandering all over the sets while re-watching this. And I think the first 45 minutes gives you a perfect introduction to Marion. At first you think she is going to get away with her spir of the moment crime, then you learn that the good in her knows what she did was wrong, and that she wants to go back and make the best she can of her mistake.

What begins as a story about someone stealing money becomes one about murder in a seedy motel shower. Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a secretary who is supposed to deposit a huge sum of money, but instead takes it and leaves Phoenix, Arizona, headed towards California. Along the way, she is shadowed by a cop (the classic Hitchcockian theme of distrust towards police) and finds her way to a rundown motel off the old highway, The Bates Motel. Running the once popular, now with \"12 cabins, 12 vacancies\" motel is Norman Bates, played by Anthony Perkins in wonderful manic weirdness. You know something is askew with young Norman in the very first scenes we see him, but we can't quite put our finger on it. Is it his stuffed bird collection? Is it how he talks about his mother? Is it the way he communicates to Marion Crane in their uncomfortable conversations they have? It's probably the combination of all of the above, but whatever it is, Perkins portrays Bates in such a manner that we know something is wrong with him. In perhaps the most famous scene in movie history, the switch to the money is made. The star of the film, the Marion Crane character is killed off while taking a shower by Norman Bates' mother in brutal fashion. We the audience think we see a lot more than we actually do, if you look at the scene carefully. The scene is 45 seconds long, but features over 90 individual cuts and camera angles, leading to a manic and desperate moment in the movie. The music during the scene, almost as famous as the scene itself, is cutting with the violins, replicating the action in the scene itself. The shower scene in Psycho is pure movie making, showing the audience what the director wants them to see, and in what he hides leaves the viewer to imagine, and sometimes think they saw what they think they saw. The rest of the film plays as an investigative film, as Marion's loved ones try to piece together what happened after she ran off with the money. The star of the second half of the film is Norman Bates as he tries to cover up the murder by his mother, and his paranoid ways really show up during this period. The film benefits from being shot in black and white and the violin-only musical score adds much more depth to the mood of the film. Made for less than a million dollars, Psycho is also an example of what a director can do for cheap. This movie touched a nerve with the movie-going public, as many people feared taking showers for months after seeing Psycho.

Anthony Perkin's and Janet Leigh's performances seem truly genuine and real all the way through. The shower scene is undoubtedly the most memorable horror moment in film history. There's something about that scene that makes it hard to watch even to this day. Notice when 'Mother' opens the shower curtain how you can just barely make out the eyes that stare so coldly at Leigh before the knife comes down on her. And the brief moment where we see 'Mother' leave the bathroom. The entire scene is just masterful. It never gets old, never will. It will remain the definitive piece of film-making and will remain the granddaddy of all horror pictures.On another note, Psycho II and III are actually worth watching, despite what some people may say. They aren't the masterpiece that the original is of course but the filmmakers wisely don't try to duplicate it. They are very different stories from the original. They are a (especially Part II) quite intelligent continuation of the character Norman Bates. If you are interested in seeing what happens to Norman in the years to come, they are indispensable.As for the remake... I'm not sure it's worth mentioning. As a movie, it stinks because it's already been done, and it just proved that the original can't be beat. Then again, I've heard it should be just looked at as a tribute.

Everything about that scene is classic, from the camera angles, to the music, to the blood running into the sink(which was chocolate syrup since the movie was in black and white).This is a very difficult film to write a review on.

The film \"Psycho\" starts out inside a darkened hotel room on a broiling Friday afternoon in December in the city of Phoenix Arizona. Marion Crane and Sam Loomis, Janet Leigh and John Gavin, have just finished off an afternoon quickie as they both get dressed to get back to their individual jobs after their lunch break. Depressed at having to meet and make love in the secrecy of a hotel room instead of at home like a married couple is getting both Marion and Sam very upset but they don't have the money to get married as well as raise a family. With Marion having a job as a secretary and Sam as a warehouse manager and also being very deeply in debt. Marion later that afternoon is called into the office of her boss George Lowery, Vaughn Taylor, and given some $40,000.00 in cash from a client of his Tom Cassidy, Frank Albertson,to put away at the local bank for the weekend. It's then that something clicks in Marion's mind where she decides to steal the money and use it to skip town and later marry Sam. Trading in her old car for a new one at a car dealership with $700.00 of the stolen cash Marion drives out west to California and as night falls it starts to rain very heavily and with the visibility next to zero she goes off the main highway on to a small country road that leads to the Bates Motel. Getting a room from Norman Bates at the motel Norman starts to become friendly and falls for the pretty sweet as well as obviously distressed Marion. This makes Norman's old and infirm mother Mrs.Bates very angry with him for not paying any attention towards her. Mrs. Bates also develops a very vicious and violent hatred towards Marion for what she thinks is her stealing Norman away from her.Later in her motel room Marion has seconds thoughts about her taking the $40,000.00 and plans to return it the next day to her employer back in Phoenix after having a good nights sleep at the motel but the bitter and vengeful Mrs. Bates has other ideas. Horrific film that has you at the edge of your seat and by the end falling off it. With the murderous Mrs. Bates on a knife wielding rampage attacking and slashing Marion as she's taking a shower leaving her to bleed to death on the floor of the bathtub. The shower scene is one of the most terrifying horror sequences ever put on film. The scene slowly builds itself up as the crazed Mrs. Bates enters Marion's room and creeps up to her in the shower. Quickly pulling the shower curtains apart Mrs. Bates lays into Marion with a large kitchen knife that had people in movie houses back them, 1960, choke on their popcorn and candy bars. Alfred Hitchcock set the scene up in a deliberately slow and deadly pace but when it exploded it left those watching, like poor Marion, in a state of first shock and then sheer terror. Even more effective, but not as popular with the movie going public, is when Mrs. Bates confronts private detective Milton Arbogast (Martin Balsam), who was hired to find Marion,at the top of the stairs in the Bates house. All at once when you, and Det. Arbogast, never expected it Mrs. Bates lashes her knife into Det. Arbogast face cutting it open. As Det. Arbogast falls to the bottom of the staircase Mrs. Bates pounces on him, like a cat, and savagely finishes him off. This all happened so fast that you, like Arbogast, didn't even have enough time to anticipate it which made it that much more effective. It later turns out that the insane Mrs. Bates had already murdered a number of people, before she murdered both Marion and Det. Arbogast, over the years and had them and their cars sunk in a nearby lake with the help of her willing son Norman to hide the evidence. The shock to end all shocks comes near the end of the movie when Marion's sister Lila, Vera Miles, goes down to the basement of the Bates house and finds out just who and what Mrs. Bates really is and who was the real person behind the bloody and brutal murders at the Bates Motel.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 5}, "heading": "Are there still any vacancies at the Bates Motel?", "date": "2004-10-31T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0955387", "sentiment score": [0.0324, 0.2, 0.5672, 0.1849, 0.0155]}, {"content": "I first saw this movie when I was a young girl and had never seen anything like it.

The movie is loosely based upon the novel by Robert Bloch and it was adapted by Joseph Stefano.

Hitchcock proved that he could adapt to the changing styles of Hollywood and make a true horror classic.

Anthony Perkins is very effective as Norman Bates, a young man who's life has been ruined by his overbearing mother.

Just when film makers such as himself where being phased out by Hollywood, Mr. Hitchcock redefined not only as a director but in the process changed the face of horror forever.The success of this movie spawned three direct sequels, a pilot for a t.v. series (Bates Motel) and a badly made remake (Although I have to say the cinematography was beautiful). It has also been parodied to death and referenced in many horror films and comedies. Psycho has not only achieved worldwide fame but it's also a part of Americana as well.

Sure, forty-plus years of pop-culture saturation had made me aware of the basic outline of \"Psycho\"--the plot, the music, the shower scene--but never had I sat down and watched it from beginning to end. Well, no time like the present.What is it that makes \"Psycho\" haunt and disquiet us, even today? Certainly there are plenty of movies out there that are more gruesome, with higher body counts and more graphic portrayals of sudden and bloody death. And there are many films good at providing sudden scares and shocking denouements. Yet so few make us glance uneasily over our shoulders or shiver in quiet moments long after they've ended. Perhaps it's because Alfred Hitchcock has created a picture of evil that is not only very real on screen, but is also disturbingly recognizable and accessible.In \"Psycho,\" we are reminded that darkness and death are far closer to us than we like to believe. That any person, given desperation enough and temptation enough, might resort to grand theft as Marion Crane (Leigh) does.That someone so shy and genial as Norman Bates (played to perfection by Anthony Perkins) can be possessed of terrible secrets. That the space between life and death is a brief one indeed, one which we can cross (or be pushed over) at any time or place: through a door, at the top of the stair, or--of course--when we are naked and vulnerable in the shower. We don't think about these things; we cannot if we are to function in life. But Hitchcock makes us pause and remember them for a few moments.With so much focus on that famous shower scene, it's easy to forget that there are many moments of brilliance here. Such as Marion's clearly-drawn paranoia when she's absconding with that money. The deliberate manner in which Norman cleans up after \"Mother.\" The death of Detective Arbogast, in its own way as sudden and shocking as poor Marion's demise. And the final revelation, which was no doubt a surprise to the first audiences and which now in retrospect makes the rest of the film even more chilling.And of course, there's Norman Bates himself. Nervous, accommodating, and seemingly harmless (at least until he's revealed spying on Marion's room), the last person you'd expect to have blood on his hands. But after all, isn't that what we always hear people saying on the news, as some neighbor or relative is taken away for a brutal crime? \"I can hardly believe it...he was quiet and kept to himself, but he seemed like such a nice person.\" Norman could be anyone we know--and that alone makes him more frightening than all the supernatural monsters and slashers you could name.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Chilling, even after all this time (spoilers)", "date": "2004-10-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0944597", "sentiment score": [0.0385, 0.1588, 0.2302, 0.4111, 0.1614]}, {"content": "*MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS*\"Psycho\" is a really good film.

Just this: If you've never seen it, you owe it to yourself to do so, not because it's a way of paying homage to the one true master of modern film, but because it's so fun to watch.Janet Leigh plays a bored office drone who decides to steal some loot from her boss's obnoxious client and parlay it into a new life with her all-too-distant boyfriend. All is going more or less according to plan until she stops in at the wrong motel, where she befriends a friendly if somewhat nerdy desk clerk only to find it causes problems with that clerk's possessive mother, who as her boy explains, \"is not herself today.\" I'll say she isn't, and so would Leigh's Marion Crane, who maybe should have put up that \"Do-Not-Disturb\" sign before taking a shower.You can feel the decade literally shifting out of '50s and into '60s with this one. Even the opening shot, where the camera looks over a Western U.S. city in the middle of the afternoon and zooms in on what looks exactly like the Texas School Book Depository overlooking Dealey Plaza. Norman Rockwell touches abound, like the decor of the motel, but look at what's going on around it. People dress well, they still wear fedoras and jackets, but in their tense conversations and hooded gazes you can feel the culture just ticking away like a time bomb waiting to explode.Most especially, there's Anthony Perkins, who plays motel clerk Norman Bates in a very oddly naturalistic way, complete with facial tics and half-swallowed words, not the polished image one expected to see then. Just compare him with John Gavin, who plays Marion's boyfriend in the standard-actor-of-the-day way. Perkins manages to be so weirdly magnetizing, even in small moments like the way he stumbles on the word \"falsity\" or notes how creepy he finds dampness to be.He shines in bigger scenes, too, like his tense chat with Martin Balsam's boorish but diligent private detective character, Arbogast, who along with Perkins and Leigh delivers a landmark performance. The way both actors play out the awkwardness in their conversation makes you literally sweat. Then again, you're always uneasy around Norman. You definitely feel wary of him right away, but you find yourself liking him, too, even when he's busy covering up \"Mother's\" misdeeds. Not since Bela Legosi played Dracula did you get a horror movie with such a compelling central figure.If you are sampling the many other comments here, be sure to look up Merwyn Grote's. He makes an interesting, compelling case for how director Alfred Hitchcock used his television series as a template for \"Psycho.\" Certainly \"Psycho\" looks more like early 1960s television than any of the more sumptuous fare Hitchcock had been bringing to screen at the time. Not only is it in black-and-white, not color, but the sets; a ramshackle motel, a mothbally old house, a couple of cheap looking bedrooms, a bathroom in a used-car dealership, are deliberately low class.It's thrilling to see Hitchcock move so effectively outside his normal element, and move things along with such clinical detachment and low-key technical finesse. Thrilling, too, to realize this is one of his most accomplished products; made by a man who was experienced enough to know how the game was played, and daring enough still to break the rules; indeed, start a whole new ballgame.Is it the best Hitchcock movie? It's definitely one of his best, right up there with \"The 39 Steps\" and \"Strangers On A Train\" and \"Sabotage\" and \"Shadow Of A Doubt.\" He only once again came close to making as good a film, with \"The Birds,\" while Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins never escaped the greatness they helped create here. Poor John Gavin had to quit the biz entirely, and became an ambassador.Often imitated, parodied, referenced, and analyzed to death, \"Psycho\" still isn't played out nearly 45 years after it came out.

Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is the heroine of the story who steals $40,000 of her boss's money and flees the city. Twists and turns abound as Marion is followed by a police officer for much of her trip neither her nor us knowing what he knows or why he finds her suspicious.Eventually Marion meets up with Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who runs a run-down hotel much like any you could find along any highway anywhere in the country. What follows is one of the most famous scenes and events in motion picture history.

So what happens when a film becomes a modern fable with every scene recognized and many of the twists expected, especially in a film steeped so heavily in suspense?Hitchcock's suspense is not simply based on the fact that the viewer doesn't know what's going happen, rather he turns those expectations into fears by limiting our scope to that of the camera. We all know THAT the investigator is going to be killed, it's in the trailer, but the exact moment is as much a mystery to us as it is to the victim.I was intrigued as to how much parts of the film resembled an Attic tragedy since there is some great foreshadowing (Bates's hesitance to show her the bathroom) and characters who bring something to the table, but who are ultimately lacking. Bates's own downfall would need to be explored more deeply (the psychiatrist's speech doesn't cut it) to really merit such a label, which the now infamously terrible remakes attempted to explore.What I find most fascinating is the shift, it's as if half the film is devoted to the aftermath and is exceeding the suspense structure that Hitchcock had created. It was daring and worked perfectly. It may seem not that the film was based too much on it's ability to frighten, but there are enough Freudian (albeit, relatively transparent) references as well as some clever arrangements of the camera and the props to keep today's sanest at the most, fascinated, and at the least, entertained.4 out of 5 - An excellent film.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Oedipus Unbound", "date": "2004-06-17T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0072349", "sentiment score": [0.006, 0.0148, 0.0137, 0.9316, 0.0338]}, {"content": "If you're reading this, chances are you've seen the film - so there is little point describing the plot. Okay. Why do I keep revisiting this film, and why do I hold it to such a high regard? Two words - acting and directing. If this is the first 'real' horror movie, or the first slasher film, it is the best because it doesn't fall into the traps associated with later (and cheesier) horror films. For one, all of the characters are 'real' and intelligent. Sure, Norman Bates is weird, and Marion Crane is scared of him, but she's also sympathetic to his plight. It isn't like he's waving around butcher knives and she says, \"Hmm, well, I think I'll go take a shower now!\" The conversation in Norman's parlour ends on a pleasant note (after having navigated through some very dark material) and she leaves to go prepare for bed - she couldn't have suspected what was about to happen or the audience would have suspected it too - the killing wouldn't have been a shock at all. Another thing about these 'real' characters. Arbogast starts out hard-boiled, but his conversatin with Norman in the motel office seems so real to the point where I suspect that the dialogue was ad-libbed. But of course Hitchcock wouldn't have allowed that. But the dialogue doesn't sound scripted at all. It's all in the delivery - very effective, we get to see that Arbogast is very good at his job - not an amateur at all. When Sam and Lila go to the motel to do their own investigation, there is inspired dialogue that you wouldn't hear in a conventional horror film. For one thing, when they enter the bathroom, the scene of the earlier carnage, Sam matter-of-factly remarks \"there's no shower curtain\". It's just a coment, and neither character dwells on this miniscule of details - how could they have guessed that it was used to wrap Marion's body with before she was dumped in her car trunk? As well, when Sam decides to occupy Norman while Lila searches the house, he says \"If you find anything, anything at all, don't stop to tell me\". See? Again, this wouldn't have occurred in a regular movie. The characters are intelligent and think out their actions before they act on them. And while Lila is put in the position of choosing to either run out the back door of Norman's house or down the flight of stairs and into the basement, she chooses the stairs (famous horror movie mistake) not because she is stupid, but because she is curious and wants nothing else but to find out what happened to her sister. It's one thing to have a main character massacred halfway through the film, but it's a much different movie that show's the intricate clean up of the crime scene - the mopping up of the blood, the wiping of the floor, walls and bathtub, the careful disposal of the body, etc, etc. While the murder last for less than 30 seconds, the clean up goes on for 10 minutes, and makes the scene far, FAR more disturbing. Watching dutiful Norman clean up his 'Mother's' mess, looking at the blood on his hands, smiling happily as the car sinks below the surface of his backyard swamp...well, it reaches a level of 'disturbing' that most movies hope to achieve but never reach.

It has been broken down and analyzed ad nauseam as an example of the fine art of editing. It is a great sequence, but to me the best scene in PSYCHO occurs just before that. Janet Leigh as Marion Crane, on the run from having committed a crime, sits in the parlor behind the Bates Motel's office and discusses nothing and everything with Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, the motel's lonely proprietor. It is a chat between strangers who desperately need to talk to someone, anyone, but have no one to whom they can confide. It is a beautifully written and acted scene, which serves as the calm before the storm. For all of its flashiness and sleight-of-hand gore, the shower sequence isn't nearly as effective at showing what a master filmmaker Hitchcock was. It is in the parlor scene that the entire narrative spins around; as the audience is prompted to switch their allegiance from Marion to Norman. Nothing really happens in the scene, other than two characters talking, but how things are said reveals as much as what is actually said. Here Marion comes to terms with her mistake and decides to pull herself out of her \"private trap.\" Norman introduces us, indirectly, to Mother and wins our sympathy, which is vital to the way the rest of the film plays out. The scene very skillfully sets the mood of uneasiness that propels us into the upcoming murder, even as it suggests that Marion is achieving a sense of inner peace. Madness is revealed, danger is suggested, yet the audiences is coolly and cruelly lulled into an almost tranquil state. It is obvious something is coming, but not so soon. Then the shower curtain is ripped aside and blood begins to splatter.The measure of a film like PSYCHO is not how cleverly it fools you the first time, but how irrelevant its surprises are to enjoying it time after time. Indeed, compare it to Gus Van Sant's 1998 remake, or even Brian De Palma's 1980 semi-remake, DRESSED TO KILL, and the power of the film is obvious. Van Sant's version, though a scene for scene imitation is barely watchable even once, especially if you are already familiar with the plot; and while De Palma's homage is stylish and intriguing the first time around, its psychology and plot tricks don't stand up on repeated viewings. By contrast, Hitchcock's PSYCHO can be viewed repeatedly with full awareness and appreciation of knowing what is coming up next. I think an element of Hitchcock's genius is apparent in that he doesn't treat his major plot twist as a just a gimmick. The entire first half of PSYCHO could have been treated as just a shaggy dog story, a prelude marking time until Norman Bates' story takes center stage. But Hitchcock realized that Janet Leigh's story had to be presented with all due gravity, otherwise the shift to Anthony Perkins' story wouldn't be nearly as effective. Neither Van Sant nor De Palma seemed to understand this, especially De Palma who treats the Angie Dickinson scenes in DRESSED with a cruel, condescending sense of humor. Hitchcock's PSYCHO works as a whole, but could very easily have been presented as two independent episodes of \"Alfred Hitchcock Presents.....\" Marion Crane's story is not just a build up (though Hitchcock himself claimed that killing off his leading lady was all meant as a joke on the audience), but as a complete story unto itself, replete with the type of shocking twist ending that was the hallmark of Hitchcock's television anthology. Likewise, the Norman Bates half of PSYCHO, is a complete suspense tale in its own right. The shower scene is the bridge between the two stories, but it is the scene in the parlor that cements the two tales -- and the fates of the two protagonist. And if you look at PSYCHO as two separate parts of a whole, then Marion's story is revealed to be the more complete of the two. Norman's story, while beautifully done, is essentially a mystery story; Sam, Lila and Arbogast are trying to solve a whodunit: what happened to Marion and the $40,000? The cleverness of Hitchcock and screenwriter Joseph Stefano is that they let us think we know the answer right off the bat, building to a conclusion where it is revealed how completely we have been fooled. In the end, we know little more than Lila and Sam. To some extent, this is the real gimmick of the film. On the other hand, Marion's story allows Hitchcock to make so much out of so little. He creates tension, even though there is no tangible threat. Marion is on the run with stolen funds, but the theft hasn't even been discovered yet. All of the danger is strictly in her mind: What will happen when...? She is a smart woman who has done something very stupid, but proceeds even as her fears grow and grow. But cinematically the suspense is created out of mundane things: a policeman's face at the car window, rain and windshield wipers slashing across the screen, the glare of on coming headlights. Mix this with the haunting voice overs of accusing voices and Bernard Herrmann incredible musical violence and the effect is hypnotic. But these imagined dangers do not prepare Marian or the audience for the real dangers ahead.And something has to be said for Janet Leigh. Always overshadowed by Anthony Perkins' iconic performance, Leigh never gets her due (though she was nominated for an Oscar, she lost to Shirley Jones in ELMER GANTRY). But she dominates the first half of the film with a vivid performance that is sexual, humorous and bittersweet. So much of her role depends on the subtlety of her facial expressions: her sad smile at pretending to believe Sam's excuses for not marrying her, her bemused glances at the flirtatious old millionaire, her self-satisfied smirks as she thinks about how people will react to discovering her crime, her mixture of concern and fear as she talks to Norman in the backroom parlor. Plus, she displays an attitude that is both smart and sexy. It is one of the great film performance.It's easy to take PSYCHO for granted now; it has been imitated so many times in so many ways by far lesser talents. Indeed, it's one negative is that it inspired so may pale imitations, including its own three sequels and a very bad remake. Yet even so, PSYCHO remains a one and only original. And its iconic status can't be denied; it redefined the concepts of what a Hitchcock film was and what a horror film could be.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 19, "votes": 22}, "heading": "It was a dark and stormy night...", "date": "2004-06-13T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0072347", "sentiment score": [0.0072, 0.0722, 0.3656, 0.503, 0.0521]}, {"content": "Oft-cited as one of the top horror movies of all time, along with such fare as \"Jaws\" and \"Alien\", \"Psycho\" is Alfred Hitchcock's most well-known film. Why would this one film, made before the peak of his career, come to be the most famous? It's simple: Hitchcock was at his best when he toyed with audiences' expectations, and \"Psycho\" did that in a big way.Viewers in the 1960's were not as jaded and suspicious when they waled into theaters as they are today. Now, people try to guess the endings of M. Night Shyamalan movies before the first hour is up, whereas the audiences of Hitchcock's time were more passive. Hitchcock took advantage of this quality by establishing a seemingly unstable character -- the titular psycho -- only to force us later on to question who was really most deserving of that dubious honor.The plot is simple: Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a struggling office worker, carrying on a relationship with a man she knows can't support her. Faced with these pressures and an opportunity to change them, she steals $40,000 from her workplace and goes on the run. She stops at the Bates Motel, a forgotten little establishment strapped for visitors ever since the highway was diverted elsewhere. The caretaker there is Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a charming young man who exudes an aura of strange intensity. It is there at the motel that the fate of Marion and her stolen money will be decided, by forces outside her control. The nature of those forces is not truly revealed until the last minutes of the film, in what was an truly outrageous ending for a movie of the 60's.The performances of the main characters are very good, with special attention being paid to Anthony Perkins. Perkins never got another major role after his turn as the conflicted Norman Bates; his stellar performance in \"Psycho\" cementing him in audience's minds as a certain kind of character actor. Janet Leigh as Marion Crane acts just as you would expect a desperate and paranoid criminal on the run to. The supporting cast is capable, with the exception of Marion's love interest, Sam Loomis (John Gavin). He comes off as the typical, brutish boyfriend type, a one-note character with little to do other than exist in various stages of outrage.The camerawork in \"Psycho\" is exceptional, especially considering the tools available to Hitchcock at the time. The long zoom in to the room where Sam and Marion are meeting is phenomenal for a 60's movie, as is the way Hitchcock stages the infamous \"shower scene\" that so scared the public. As in the aforementioned classic horror movies, Hitchcock deftly hides his \"monster\", his \"psycho\", allowing us only brief glimpses at it to let the tension and suspense to build. Perhaps the ultimate failing of \"Psycho\" is in its lasts minutes, when the unmasking of the true \"psycho\" leaves audiences over-saturated with information when they had so long been left in the dark. There is such a thing as \"too much information\", and the end of \"Psycho\" suffers for it.\"Psycho\" is and will continue to be remembered as the seminal Hitchcockian film, whether it is his best or not (I, for one, find \"Rear Window\" to be a better film). With the way Hitchcock played the movie-going audience of his time, it is little wonder why this is.

She ends up being killed that same night she checks in, in the infamous shower scene that will ALWAYS be a classic moment in film history. The rest of the movie is basically the murder scene being investigated, and everything is brought up to one of the most chilling and shocking conclusions you can imagine.What else can I say about PSYCHO? Great in every aspect. Acting, scripting, casting, directing (of course)... everything is so natural and subtle. The way that Hitchcock prepares everything for the viewer ultimately leads to total surprise when you least expect it.There's really not much else I can say about this movie, not much more praise I can give. It's a horror classic and deservingly so. It's also one of the first psychological thrillers, and, I believe, manifests Hitchcock's genius best.

Marion is a woman who has no idea. We are told by Hitchcock to not feel sorry for her because she is someone who has just robbed a man of his earnings and is on the run. Whilst she drives to her destination she is hearing all the voices of the people she had cheated and feeling guilty and on her way she bumps into many situations with a policeman and a car salesmen who make her feel un comfortable even more than she already is. She then arrives in the place where she thinks she is safe in the form of The Bates Motel. A secluded place where not to many visit. Here she bumps into the shy and vulnerable Norman who takes an interest into Marion the moment she steps into the motel. With Norman being so alone at many times except when his mother wants something from the house just above the motel he takes a shine to Marion as he is never bothered with guests and they bond over some tea.

Psycho is one of the films which I do find terrifying and it must have been even more terrifying when it was released back in in 1960.

Now that I've seen it, I'm not suprised. The basic plot is: (even though people who haven't seen it already know)The story is about a woman named Marian Crane who steels 40,000 dollars (at that time a 10 years salary!) and runs off to meet her boyfriend. On the way she stops at the BATES MOTEL, a hotel with \"12 rooms and 12 vacancies\" that is owned by a young man named Norman Bates. Norman has his own troubles, he lives with his mother, a spiteful and controlling woman. After a long and moving talk with Norman, Marian makes up her mind to return the money. She goes and takes a shower and is murdered by who appears to be Norman's mother. A few moments later Norman finds her dead. The remainder of the movie is about Marian's sister and boyfriend attempting to find out what happened to Marian, and Norman is trying to cover for \"mom\". Mom ends up to have been dead for 10 years. Norman killed her (for why see movie) and couldn't live with what he had done, so he tried to recreate Mom, in the end he developed Multiple Personality disorder. HE killed Marian and 2 other women before her AS his mother. He would later \"awake as if in a daze\" to discover what he had done. \"Mom\" killed because Norman had been in love with Marian, and the 2 other women and he NEEDED his mother to care about him enough to do anything to keep him with her.

Honesty and lies. Infidelity, trust, and honor. Light and Darkness. Black and white. Life and death. Freedom and traps. Sanity and psychosis. Male and female. Alfred Hitchcock studies each of these in Psycho. In fact, it is the study of these dichotomies, these human conditions that make this thriller timeless and allow it to be considered a true classic.Each of us has human fallibilities. It is the struggle between the perfectibility of man and the imperfection of the human condition that creates the traps that Norman Bates speaks of. In the foretelling rendezvous in the office parlor, Marion and Norman focus on the human condition and how we each weave our own tangled webs. In this scene, Hitchcock clearly shows the fragile female, using sinister lighting and superior camera angles to make her appear vulnerable and susceptible. Hitchcock pits her against the male on the prowl who is conflicted with his own demons and trapped, seemingly, by a traveler's hotel that gets no travelers. Marion is uncomfortable, alone, and on the run straight into a trap of her own making; Norman is uncomfortable, alone, and trapped on what may as well be a dead-end road. Norman is more than a hotelier; he is clearly the nervous suitor, fetching homemade sandwiches to feed the lovely visitor. Marion is registered under a false name, believing that the police will catch her at any moment. If only she were so lucky.When Norman reveals his sexual interest by peering through the hole in the wall, losing yet another struggle to be good, Marion is exposed at a time when each of us would be vulnerable: as we disrobe in an unknown environment, to prepare to rest from a long day. As the characters lose the struggles that they are fighting, Hitchcock reveals more about ourselves than he does about Norman.Hitchcock's sense of pace throughout the movie, starting slowly and building to a climax, with various false summits along the way, are combined with the musical score to keep the audience attentive. We find ourselves rooting for the adulterous embezzler, even after her fall from grace, partly because of her decision to extricate herself from her trap while there was still time. Our desire to find out who done it, even after Marion is no longer a part of the story, is a credit to the skillful manipulation of the audience, and of the realization that any of us could find ourselves in a similar predicament, and we would want justice to be served.

Nothing in the story stands out in the first forty-five minutes or so which I think was meant to build suspense. The first part of a story is the crucial time to grab the audience's attention so that it can hold it for the rest of the tale, any attempt to grab their focus later is too late. The dialogue and action is very low energy and uninteresting, it was nothing worth wasting your time watching. \t To be fair, the frame of mind before you watch the 1960's movie Psycho is important. One must realize that at the time of the movie's release, the public hadn't been desensitized by excessive violence in the media yet, and that the standard for what was suspenseful was very different then.

This film had all the right elements: a good solid plot/storyline filled with scandal, deceit, horror and MURDER which was all backed up with excellent camera work, cinematography, and good old fashioned directing from the one and only, Alfred Hitchcock.Being a Hitchcock creation, there is much to be expected from the flick and needless to say, the man delivered to the fullest. Well-choreographed camera movements strongly portrayed the emotion of each character within the shots and captured the audience's attention right from the get-go. Every shot had life and individuality. Creative camera angles and close-ups illustrated the characters' movements/interactions with Swiss precision. The shadows that were used in the murder scenes were a nice touch. This gave away the premonition that obviously, something bad was about to happen, but was still very intimidating and spooky and worked well with the classic black and white tinge the film was presented in.The film's soundtrack did more than just add suspense. The music made the scene a lot more believable and provided a brilliant hook for the viewer to latch onto. The gut-wrenching stroke of each string given by Herrmann's mini orchestra brought out the obvious emotions in every scene it accompanied whether it was worry, fear, despair, etc.The inner monologues were another nice touch. If the shots and the soundtrack weren't enough for the audience, Norman and Marion's inner monologues filled in the blanks. They both showed not only their thoughts, but also, their persona. It allowed the audience to tap into their minds and really see what was going on inside of them.Of course you can't talk about Psycho, without talking about the legendary shower scene. Honestly, this reviewer got more than a few hearty laughs in when watching this `horrific' display of violence. The scene was obviously needed, but could've been a lot more believable. The sound effects were okay, but the actual knife slashing and the body contact were\u0085dare I say\u0085CHEAP! This reviewer is fully aware that it was the 1960's, but come on! Hitchcock was a cinematic genius! He could've made the scene a little less comical and a lot more horrifying. But hey, it was good, almost as good as the ending. Now this reviewer doesn't like to reveal secrets, but would like to say that the ending may not have the same effect to a modern-day audience as it did to a 1960's audience, because inconceivable endings like this one have been duplicated and butchered by following directors over the past 40 years. Just try to keep in mind that this film is an original masterpiece and maybe, you'll see a hint of Hitchock's creativity and brilliance.All in all, it was an superb film. This psychological thriller undoubtedly deserves the prestige and positive reviews it has received from countless critics. It has set the standard for what a good cinematic thriller should be. Psycho is for anyone who loves a good mystery and/or overall excellent film. Do not let the black and white discourage you, instead, embrace it and welcome it.

Made in 1960 this film was well ahead of its time. The movie stars Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates, a curious motel manager, Janet Leigh as Marion Crane, John Gavin as Sam Loomis, and John McIntire as Sheriff Al Chambers.Psycho forever changed the way films were made in Hollywood. Alfred Hitchcock's genius shaped this masterpiece in such a way to draw the viewer in and keeping them on the edge of their own seat. With his experience in movie making, Hitchcock knows just how to influence and play with the mind.Alfred Hitchcock is considered `The Master of Suspense,' and has earned that name rightfully. He created movies that one would have to watch over and over again in order to get all the little details of a film. Psycho is a perfect example of that, using lighting and camera angles to give the watcher a feeling of being anxious, scared, or weary of what is about to happen. One might notice that when any certain scene is shown, the camera gets closer and closer to the actor or actress's face, making it very uncomfortable to watch. Every aspect of this film is amazing for it's time, with a score that has been nominated to be one of the top 100 most influential pieces of music in American history. \nOverall, I give Psycho a 9 out of 10 stars, for being a good movie in general. It's a powerful film that goes deeper than just scaring people. I would recommend this movie to anybody who loves old horror classics.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 4, "votes": 7}, "heading": "Genius", "date": "2004-02-20T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0072319", "sentiment score": [0.0037, 0.0124, 0.1074, 0.7848, 0.0916]}, {"content": "Knowing all of Hitchcock's little quirks makes watching one of his films more interesting. His preference of blondes, his obsession with the bathroom and the letters BM are just a few. Hitchcock liked to use foreshadowing also in his films, which makes the film more interesting to the viewer because while some would think it distracts from the element of surprise, it's done in such a subtle way that it only makes a difference if the viewer is looking for it. The viewer isn't sure what will happen next but there are little clues to add more of the mystery element to the suspense story. Also, the actors play their scenes well\u0085 especially Anthony Perkins who seems to have schizophrenia down to a science. Janet Leigh does well as a confused girl gone bad, (Not so much a good girl because she has hotel rendezvous with a certain non-committal man.) her character Marion Crane, takes a drastic measure in hopes to seal the deal with her boyfriend and things don't work out so well for her. In this process Janet has to act out the famous `shower scene' and does so very well; it has to be difficult to play a naked woman in a distressed situation but the viewer wouldn't guess so from her performance. Anthony Perkins, who plays Norman Bates, also does very well, he is truly an amazing actor. When Anthony plays the actual Norman he's so convincing as a charming young man, as a female viewer it's almost hard to not fall for the boy-next-door facade he puts on; then there is Norman's alter-ego, his other half, that the viewer gains full details about at the conclusion of the film. This alter ego is not displayed until the ending also in a very creepy moment that takes the cake for this performance. The little clues that Hitchcock places in the story are very subtle but are fun to think about after viewing the movie, for instance, Norman's love for stuffing things and keeping them `alive' so to speak; after watching the film it puts a few more pieces of the puzzle together. Another of Hitchcock's quirks is to show up in his film at random spots, one of which is in front of the business where Marion works. Hitchcock has a hat on and is standing on the sidewalk waiting to cross the street in the scene when Marion comes back from her lunch break. The work scene also displays yet another of Hitchcock's loves: blondes. There are two secretaries in the office, Marion the blonde and her opposite the brunette who doesn't even get named. A very wealthy businessman comes into the workplace and immediately gives his attention to Marion, not only that but her opposite is a complete ditz. She doesn't sound very intelligent and seems very oblivious, especially when she makes the comment that Mr. `Wealthy' must have seen her wedding ring that's why he didn't flirt with her. (When in fact it's obvious that she's NOT very attractive. All in all this movie was very good, the suspenseful moments are very effective and this viewer found herself plugging her ears and turning her head at some moments. Psycho has received many outstanding reviews and they are justly given, this reviewer would recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys suspenseful movies even if some of the `fight' scenes are a little corny.

Becoming a director in 1925, he has been entertaining people ever since. One of the classics, and probably close to the most widely known, is Psycho, made in 1960. Now putting into fact that they didn't have much to work with concerning special effects in those times, this movie may not be the most frightening ever. But, special effects aren't what Hitchcock was all about. He was a man of mystery and always wanted to keep tension between the viewer and the film. He could create the perfect scene by moving the angle of the shot just one certain way. Filming techniques and plot seem to be his forte.\n In Psycho, one method that Hitchcock used to create a dramatic scene is the placement of the camera shots. For instance, in a \"get away,\" he would film the character while they were in a car, then show a scene out of the car. He repeated this same idea, coming closer to their face every time it re-entered the car...so close that it almost makes the viewer uncomfortable.\n Another aspect of Hitchcock's movies that makes them very memorable are the sets and the way that the characters move, talk and act. For example, a character may stutter, fidget, or talk fast when presented with certain situations. With sets and designs, he always tried to play with the look and feel of a scene. The mansion that was used in this movie created a very mysterious aura around it. This could be because of the placement, which was, on top of a dark hill with many ascending steps. It could also be because the lighting was always dim and never really showed the details, creating wonder and mystery. Obtaining an overall 8.6/10 stars, this movie is clearly brilliantly made, being loved by millions.

Alfred Hitchcock was very smart and creative about the techniques that he used which is why they have become a major part in filmmaking today.The movie starts out with Marion (Janet Leigh) and her boyfriend Sam (John Gavin) in a hotel room. She wants to marry Sam, but neither of them have the money, especially Sam; he had to give most of his money away in alimony. When Marion goes to work, her boss asks her to deposit $40,000. Knowing that she could start a new life with the large sum of money, Marion takes off with it and the suspense begins. While she is driving down the road, the camera zooms in very close to her face, making it awkward for the audience and the screen seems to get tighter and tighter and with the terrifying music playing it has you on the edge of your seat. Not all of the techniques that Hitchcock uses are technical; a lot of what makes this such a great movie is all the twists in the storyline. When Marion arrives at the hotel she is staying at there is a huge mansion in the background that appears to be very spooky. The camera shoots up at it making the viewer feel very small and intimidated. The shadows that are seen behind the curtains were a great effect and added to the spookiness of the movie. I thought that the music was one of the best techniques. A movie isn't scary unless it has the right music. I'm sure the audience could tell that he must have been a perfectionist; there was so much effort put in to this movie beyond what most would expect.

During a time when the main character is scared Hitchcock will show the face, then quickly, move to something else.

The fact that she has just commited a sin, and is now dressed in black, is a great example of powerful symolism. \tThe camera work was most definetly phenomenal.

At that point, she is stopped at a traffic light, and people are crossing the cross walk. The man who walks in front of her boss in the crosswalk is Alfred Hitchcock.

After Alfred Hitchcock Walks in front of her car, her boss walks right behind him, and notices Marian in the car. She then notices her boss, and took off. As she is driving down the road, she has voices running in her head about stolen money, while the dissonant music plays in the background.

In the bathroom at the Bates motel, also known as the classic shower stabbing scene, Marian gets murdered. As Marian is screaming, this reviewer noticed that she giggled a little bit.

If you've seen it once do see it again and enjoy Hitch's story-telling. He is quite good.

The reason it was so scary is probably because of a few reasons: DEFINITE SPOILERS!1. Obviously, the shower scene is the most terrifying part of the whole film. After I saw that, it was truly hard for me to take a shower for a while. And, of course, my mom's bathroom (we lived with her brother and mother, and there were three bathrooms in the house) was being fixed up by her brother, but she wanted me to shower in that one to test it out. But there was no door to lock, so I was almost in tears.2. The ending freaks me out every time I see it. Not because Norman was the killer, but because of the cars we see being pulled out of the swamp. I always wonder what was in there. Well I know what it was (the bodies), but what did it actually look like? That thought always scares me.3. The fact that mother says that she would never hurt a fly. that was pretty weird!Now, most people say that \"The Exorcist\" is the scariest movie ever, but I just thought that it was an excellent, not scary, movie, and I saw it when I was about 11 or 12. But \"The Exorcist\" was shattering when it was first released. No one had ever seen that before in a movie, such as the foul language said by a 12 year old innocent girl, the whole concept of possession, the vomiting, a very bloody crucifix masturbation scene with a 12 year old girl, the head spinning. That to me doesn't make me afraid of anything, but Psycho does. That is what I think makes a truly frightening film.

I recently had been hearing great things about \u0091A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum', and was disappointed in that, so my solely-based-on-reputation expectations were a little shot, plus I'd heard so much about the shower scene I figured that was the big payoff.

Why should one want to watch \"Psycho\" again? The plot is so easy to guess even when seeing the movie first time that I find there not too much excitement.What's the plot and idea of this movie? Some nut just goes killing innocent people, because he's crazy, and that's the whole story. Period. Scary? Well, as much as irrational violence is scary.I also find it disgusting that in many horror movies psychotic people are often portrayed as the cause of all evil, when most of them are only very sick and mostly not particularly harmful to anyone. What is really scary - in real life or on a film - are people basically having everything ok and a good mental health, but still often doing horrible things, including irrelevant violence. Most violence in the world is done by such \"normal\" people.I think that Hitchcock has many better movies than \"Psycho\". For example \"Rear Window\" is a true classic in its minimalism, though maybe not particularly scary, at least in the way modern horror movies playing mainly on special effects are.

It was released in 1960 (And then remade in 1998), and regarded as Alfred Hitchcock's greatest film. I made the mistake of watching the remake first, but I watched the original while at my sister's house and could tell which one was better. I could clearly see why this is probably the greatest horror film ever made, and by history's best director.The events of the movie left me in awe, and an instant Hitchcock fan. The film starts in Phoenix, Arizona where Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a real estate agent receptionist, is trusted to deliver a large sum of money from a customer and put it in the bank. However, Marion's wicked side takes control and causes her to flee from the city to her boyfriend's (John Gavin) house in California. Due to her suspicious acts, she attracts the attention of a policeman, forcing her to trade her car in. Soon the trademark stormy weather causes more troubles for Marion, making her spend the night at the mysterious hotel, with 12 cabins, 12 vacancies, and 12 showers. Marion's story soon evolves when she meets the owner, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), and learns he has a dark past of his own. From then on the plot twists will shock you, and the suspense will certainly keep you on the edge of your seat.Perkins is very convincing as Bates, and the way he fills the role of mother's-boy Norman is certainly impressive. Janet Leigh offers a great supporting role, and makes you feel sorry for throughout the film, despite her character's evil deeds. Balsam, for the short period he is in the film, gives that classic detective character whom we all know and love.The setting is possibly one of the best sets in Hollywood, because it is so eerie and mysterious. The Bates mansion, which overlooks the motel, sends chills down your spine as you see the dark silhouette sitting by the window. The camera work for the film contributed greatly to its success, like many other Hitchock films. The affects are astounding for a 1960 film. Hitchock's decision to film in black and white paid off, as it gave the movie charm, and hid the fact most of the blood was just chocolate sauce. The music is the most famous movie music ever- the screeching violin in sync with the killer's knife landing on their victim. Psycho has been parodied again and again, because it so popular. It was followed by Psycho II (1982), Psycho III (1986) and psycho IV: The beginning (1990). The movie may not be appreciated so much by younger viewers, but anyone old enough will love how the film is shot, written and acted, as well as making you think. Watch this classic at night, with the lights off.

Much of the praise is due to three ingenious elements directed by the great auteur Alfred Hitchcock: camerawork, editing, and sounds. Cleverly, our sympathy for first-half protagonist, Marian Crane (the beautiful Janet Leigh-mother of Jamie Lee Curtis), shifts towards a creepy commiseration for antagonist (?), Norman Bates. Both characters are indeed psychotic, though on different levels. We feel for Crane, knowing that her misdeed-scamming her boss out of $40,000-is wrong; and we're just as sure to be annoyed when an ominously curious state policeman tracks behind. Indeed, several could relate to Marian Crane, having had the feeling of splitting from the real world and all its dilemmas before, or merely Arizona, in her case. Crane's destination is Los Angeles, assumingly comparative to the numerous venturing for more glory and escapism. On her way she decides to spend a night at an off-road dive; it's raining hard and who needs more with another pesky trooper? Rather than using the typical fat, old, balding loner from the Psycho novel, Hitchcock and screenwriter Joseph Stefano employ a relatively more normal, attractive personality to exemplify the Bates Motel manager. With that, Anthony Perkins sets off one of film's greatest performances. For much of the second half, mama's boy Bates becomes the character we are more concerned about.The cinematography in Psycho is as creepy as the plot. Shot in black and white, not because Hitchcock had to, but because he wanted to, our two main characters are followed in medium shot thoroughly at every step. Every reaction is recorded to its highest definition, from Bates searing eyeball scheming on his guest's undergarment, to Crane's multiple changes of expression when the pursuing officer veers right. Psycho is a non-stop showcase of vigorous zooming and follow-framing. What makes this formalist approach to film-making so great is its unconventionality. Alfred Hitchcock was keen on every detail, providing a window for viewers to snatch every bit. Hitchcock also provided psychological clues to the story in his score, perhaps one of the top three to five greatest ever composed (even Busta Rhymes wanted to `Gimme Some More'). The screeching violin play chillingly reflects the screeching sounds of birds, symbolism often found throughout Psycho. Even the sudden clash of windshield wipers during Crane's stormy drive to Los Angeles is a conceivable preview to what lay ahead.Perhaps nothing is more impressive, however, than the editing. Oftentimes the first thing mentioned about Psycho is the notorious `shower scene.' Aside from changing the entire landscape of the film, from a quickly-paced protagonist goal to a slower-moving character study, the scene contains a barrage of amazing edits. In this horrific slashing scene, we miss nudity and contact-gore if you will-yet, to much of our delight. The pacing of this classic montage is more attractive, in essence, because of its unpredictability. And with Hitchcock, why expect nothing else?\n5/5 stars", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Psycho review", "date": "2003-10-22T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0072294", "sentiment score": [0.0243, 0.0593, 0.0755, 0.3535, 0.4873]}, {"content": "\"Television has brought murder back into the home - where it belongs.\" - Alfred HitchcockI am often asked what my favorite film of all time is. My reply is always the same: I do not have a favorite from all the genres. But from the thousands of films I have seen, I have not seen a film more horrifying nor terrifying as Alfred Hitchcock's \"Psycho,\" the only movie that has ever truly scared me in my entire life. And so I can honestly say that \"Psycho\" is the scariest film I have ever seen, and is quite probably my favorite horror film of all time.This is the movie that redefined the genre, and literally gave birth to psychological thrillers. By today's standards, \"Psycho\" may seem - at the most - tame. Audiences may not be scared by the plot anymore - a plot that was, at the time, unlike anything other, but nowadays quite normal. Gus Van Sant remade Hitchcock's classic in 1998 with both critics and audiences blowing it off. Modern audiences of today are used to slashers such as \"Halloween,\" \"Friday the 13th,\" \"A Nightmare on Elm Street,\" \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,\" etc., and so Van Sant's \"Psycho\" did nothing but disappoint them. But I guarantee that if you place modern audiences in front of Hitchcock's \"Psycho,\" they will come out of the film terrified to death (like I was when I first saw it).Why is this? It is simply because modern audiences don't expect such creepiness and evilness to be in a 1960 film. Most modern audiences think that \"Star Wars\" (1977) was the start of motion picture history, that anything beforehand is stupid, cheery and not worth their time. They will go into Hitchcock's \"Psycho\" and expect a happy little picture, which is why they will come out pale with fear.It all comes down to the fact that in 1960, mainstream films did not have such subject matters as split personality disorder (seen in this year's \"Identity\"), figures with homicidal tendencies (like John Doe in \"Se7en\"), or characters who are literally insane (like Hannibal Lector-type-criminals). \"Psycho\" set the course for these films. It blew audiences out of the water. They had never seen anything like it before. It is probably the only film that has ever really, truly scared me to death. I didn't want to take showers for weeks.Hitchcock once said, \"Cartoonists have the best casting system. If they don't like an actor, they just tear him up.\" I'm glad Hitchcock didn't try to tear up Anthony Perkins, who plays Norman Bates in \"Psycho,\" as a shy, awkward fellow living off of a re-routed highway. He is perfectly cast and soundly directed by Hitchcock, coming off as a somewhat strange, implacable fellow. We aren't quite sure what to make of him.Phoenix banker Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) is a poor creature living off of practically nothing. She wants to get married to Sam Loomis (John Gavin), but the costs of a wedding outweigh both their incomes. And so one night when her employer entrusts Marion with 40,000 dollars, she flees with the money in the back of her car to go find Sam. However, tired from a long drive, she stops at the Bates Motel for the night. She never leaves the motel, because Norman Bates' reclusive mother becomes jealous of Marion and kills her. Or does she?Hitchcock masterfully weaves the suspense and horror in \"Psycho,\" so much so that we simply do not know what to think until everything unravels towards the end. The infamous shower scene remains one of the most impressive and wonderful segments in all motion picture history, ranking up there with the unveiling of Harry Lime in \"The Third Man,\" the revelation by Darth Vader in \"Star Wars,\" and one of my personal favorites, the part in \"Planes, Trains and Automobiles\" when Neal Page and Del Griffith wake up in bed entangled with each other. (\"Those aren't pillows!\")I think that the anticipation of fear, or the insinuation of something sinister lurking behind a shadowed doorway, is much scarier than blood and guts. Freddy Krueger does not scare some people. Modern horror films tell us what we are supposed to fear, whereas films such as \"Psycho\" leave the images up to us. Not every person may leave a Jason Voorhees movie scared. Everyone will leave \"Psycho\" scared. Because as our mind tries to place a face on the fear, our mind incorporates our very fears into the image.Alfred Hitchcock is undoutedly one of the greatest and most influential film directors in the history of motion pictures. He can create suspense like no other and he can make even the simplest story the most nail-biting, terrifying picture of all time. I recently purchased a DVD with four of Hitchcock's early British films from the thirties, including \"The 39 Steps\" and \"The Lady Vanishes.\" Hitchcock's sense of solid suspense can be felt even in those early films. He is, quite simply, the master of suspense. Is it no wonder he has gained the exact reputation as mentioned?Some films land on greatness and don't always deserve their reputation quite so much as everyone seems to think so. \"Psycho\" is not such a film. Here is a movie that bent and broke every set rule of film making for the time, and changed the course of horror films for the better. The nineties have shown a return to the classic horror/mystery/thriller mix of Hitchcock and Agatha Christie. Here is the granddaddy of them all.

So great is the film's influence on modern cinema that this fact is, in itself, amazing. Psycho broke cinematic ground in many areas, and immediately spawned countless imitators (William Castle's \"Homicidal\" comes immediately to mind.)First, consider the elements of the film's success. A razor sharp script. One of the 5 best musical scores in the history of film. One of the best acting performances (and certainly the most underrated) in film history by Anthony Perkins. Near perfect black and white photography. All these things fit together so seamlessly that it is easy to overlook them.Second, consider (and it is difficult for modern viewers, since so much of Psycho has been imitated to the point of becoming a cliche) the ways the film broke new ground. (WARNING -- SPOILERS FOLLOW)a. It killed a central character, in a completely shocking and surprising way, halfway through the film. It killed a female character! It killed a *sympathetic female* character!! These things *just weren't done* in a film before then. Let me tell you, I watched the film, at the age of 16, on the big screen. After the shower room scene, people were in a state of complete shock. My mother, who sat next to me, had dug her fingernails about a quarter inch into my forearm. The man sitting in front of me had an asthma attack. The impact of Psycho on film audiences was so powerful it is really difficult to imagine.b. It completely succeeded in fooling the audience with a major twist.Let me assure you. Virtually NO ONE who watched Psycho had ANY IDEA Norman Bates was the killer until the final scenes. The killer with a split personality has now become a tired cliche in cinema, but at the time it was revolutionary. EVERYONE thought the killer was this crazed woman we hadn't seen yet. Every one of my friends and all the adults in my neighborhood saw Psycho. Everyone admitted, laughingly, that they had been completely fooled.c. It actually created a phobia for many of its viewers!For me, and for many other people, Psycho actually created a phobia. For years after watching it, many people actually felt creeping fear every time they drew a shower curtain shut. For the master of suspense, there could be no higher tribute.I cringe when I see people call Psycho \"overrated\" or wonder aloud \"why it wasn't shot in color.\" Good grief!To understand the true genius of the film, you had to be alive at the time and watch it on the big screen. But please, please go back and watch one scene -- the \"sandwich dinner\" and ensuing conversation between Tony Perkins and Janet Leigh. Watch this scene, and all it manages to convey, then watch the identical scene played, in color, by two pretty good actors (Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche in the dreadful 1998 remake.

This poor fool wallows into a trap of her own making, wanders into another set for her by the amazingly weird Norman Bates, played intently by Anthony Hopkins.After the prime horror of the story is completed, no one can do anything.

But you're in Hitchcock land now, and what seems clear, beautiful and all-American is hiding a deep corruption steeped in fear of sex and death, and that is heavy indeed. A film like this reeks of a certain conscious angst, which is perhaps why the full color remake of a few years ago was so presumptuous. Psycho works because we have Robert Bloch and Alfred Hitchcock playing out some of the darkest realms of the subconscious in black and white. It is we, the audience, who add the color, in this dream that surrounds the dream.

(may contain spoilers) Psycho was released during the year of 1960. It was director Alfred Hitchcock's response to a frenzy created by the media's first publicized serial killer Ed Gein. Psycho brings back memories of a time when film was just as much about story as it was style. Hitchcock embodied that, a true storyteller at heart. He was an inventor, using misbegotten images and twisting them into something darkly erotic through voyeuristic tendencies presided inside of characters. Hitchcock didn't make films to scare the audience with what happens, he made films to scare the audience with what they shouldn't see but can't help but want to. I have always said that it is not hard to scare an audience if the initiative is there, but it takes a true mastermind to produce scares that will not take away from the films point, rather uphold it. Hitchcock was that mastermind. Who else could have made a murder scene in which we see a victim stabbed to death but never once actually witness the knife penetrate the flesh and still have it disturb audiences forty years later? The story to Psycho is simple, given the routine inspection. The idea, on the other hand is complex, twisting and turning around corners and bends, leading the audience to grasp onto central ideas and characterization only to turn it around and reinvent itself, as if to have never even implied any motives in the first place. That was Hitchcock's way. Janet Leigh is Marion Crane. We open to a scene of her with her secret lover. She has a headache and is going to work; they may never see each other again. Our interest has already flared. After arriving at work Marion asks for the rest of the day off after she takes an envelope filled with forty thousand dollars in cash to the bank (a client's payment on a new home). But instead of depositing the money she skips town without telling anyone and checks in at the Bates Motel. Here she meets the owner, Norman Bates, who ensures her that he has a vacancy, `in fact I have twelve. Twelve cabins, twelve vacancies.' Normal takes a liking to the girl, he is lonely and has no one but his mother. He watches Marion through a hole in the wall of his parlour; he even invites her up to his hillside home for diner. His mother won't allow this, she is much to overbearing we learn, not from seeing her but understanding her through voiced assumption. Mystery begins to peak. This all seems minimal, it isn't. These opening scenes are a form of admission to the good ones, not to say they are any less enjoyable. They build up character, making us feel like we are part of something that we aren't through melding words of falsehoods. We see them as important to building story, they are really a distraction through explanation. Now comes the shower scene, one of the most famous scenes in film history. I should not be giving anything away by saying that Marion is killed off during this scene, that was one of the many twists. When it was first released audiences could not understand why Hitchcock would be killing off his main character in a climatic occurrence a mere halfway into the film. There is a reason for it as far as I can see. A lot of people regard it as the pivotal scene in the film, it isn't. The scene on its own does not have enough constitution to regard an explanation for itself. The key scene occurs mere minutes before, in the parlour, a scene that coined the popular phrase `A boy\u0091s best friend is his mother.' It represented a breaking point in the life of Ed Gein that could explain the motives behind all actions to follow. It was speculated that Gein killed his brother after talking ill of his mother (Marion\u0091s murder), but there was never any proof found to support this logic (we never see the face of the killer). It is for that reason why the parlour scene is to be placed in such high regard. Listen closely to the dialogue in comparison to such a true-life event and then survey the shower scene as, not an action on its own, rather a physical reaction from an emotional exploit. The remainder of the film is almost of an entirely different ilk, as Marion's sister and lover search for an explanation as to why she has gone missing, and a deeper pursuit into the Mrs. Bates character. I won't get into it, for these scenes are so full of uncomfortable mystery and bitter intrigue that they almost need to vindicate themselves. But what I lastly wish to touch upon is the Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. Perkins reminds me of an old Vince Vaughn (who ironically played Bates in the Gus Van Sant remake of Psycho). He delivers a chilling performance from his nervous paranoia, what he says doesn't scare us, but what we think he isn't saying gives reason to worry. Perkins gives a truly masterful performance. There is not a lot of stones left to be turned when talking about Psycho. It has been receiving critical praise for over forty years. And though Alfred Hitchcock died in 1980 he is still greatly missed and still considered one of the most influential and important directors of all time. Revisiting this film only reminds us that, even though he has been taken away from us, his vision will forever live on through his timeless classics.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "***** out of 5", "date": "2003-07-31T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0072279", "sentiment score": [0.0525, 0.1712, 0.2941, 0.3872, 0.095]}, {"content": "This is possibly the most brilliant movie ever made.

Marion Crane, a young woman who works at a real estate company, steals a large sum of money from her office and makes a run for it. She arrives at the seemingly innocent Bates Motel, next door to an old mansion, run by young Norman Bates and his unseen, tyrannical mother. Norman is a friendly but quiet fellow who stuffs birds and runs the Bates Motel primarily by himself, and explains to her that his mother raised him alone, but has become deathly ill, and he now looks after her. When Marion asks why he doesn't leave his mother, he explains how he is psychologically chained to her. Later, when Marion goes back to her room to take a shower, she is stabbed to death by a mysterious figure in a dress, who we assume is Norman's mother. The next day, Norman, mortified by what his mother has done, puts Marion's body in her car trunk and buries it in a swamp. Later, a private detective comes searching for Marion, who meets his end when Norman's mother stabs him and pushes him down the stairs. Convinced that something is horribly wrong, Marion's sister, Lila Crane, and fiance Tom go to the motel to investigate. Lila is horrified when she goes into the basement and finds Mrs. Bates's carcass down there, still dressed in her clothes and wig. Suddenly Norman bursts through the doorm, about to kill her, when Tom wrestles him to the ground. When Norman is finally in jail, a psychiatrist explains to Lila and Tom about his bizzarre split personality. During Norman's growing up, his mother had found another lover, and Norman had gone insane and poisoned them both. He then dug up his mother's corpse from the cemetary and kept her in the house, pretending she was still alive, imitating her voice and conversing with her, dressing in her clothes, and pretending to be her. He developed two seperate personalities- one that was his own, and one that was his mother's. Because Norman was attracted to Marion Crane, \"his mother\" became jealous and killed her. Norman was completely oblivious to any of this happening, but when he was caught and arrested, his personality was completely erased and his mother's took over him completely. As he says at the film's end: \"They're probably watching me. Well, let them. Let them see what kind of person I am...I hope they are watching. They'll see. They'll see, and they'll know, and they'll say...

Anthony Perkins is brilliant as Norman Bates, who goes from being cheerful, intimidating, and truly disturbed, and leads the audience through the film to its conclusion. There are times when the audience even feels sorry for him, in all of his madness, which is more than can be said about a buttload of modern movie serial killers.

This film starring Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins attracted never-ending lines at the box office and sent the viewers home fearing for their own lives. `Psycho', which is referred to by Robin Wood as `perhaps the most terrifying film ever made' did not become a classic because it is an excellent shocker, but because it contains immensely deep themes, images and ideas that came together perfectly. This is a film that will never be duplicated, not even by the great Gus Van Sant. There are many elements that fused together to make this film the ideal horror film of all time. One major component that was essential to the effectiveness of `Psycho' was the casting. Janet Leigh plays the typical 1950's bombshell. She is calm, reserved, and very lady-like. However she shares something in common with almost all the other characters in this movie. Like her coworker with her tranquilizers, her boss with his bottle of whiskey, Cassidy with his tax-evading ways, and Norman with the obvious twist, Merion has a secret. She is involved in a sexual relationship with a man that is deeply in debt. This ultimately leads to her stealing the money and winding up in a disastrous situation. To the audience Leigh represents a good-looking version of an everyday American woman, letting the audience know that this kind of thing can happen to anybody. Norman Bates, played by Anthony Perkins is also perfectly cast. He is a very sensitive, vulnerable, and nervous character. He also seems to be stuck between boyhood and manhood, which is evident from his messy room and sworn allegiance to his mother. Together with Leigh, the two are able to create the friction and tension that is so evident throughout the entire movie. This was something that Van Sant was unable to do by casting Anne Heche and Vince Vaughn in the same roles. Heche has been a very controversial figure in the public eye over the last few years. As a result, the audience is unable to pick up the same sense of guilt that was so beautifully displayed by Leigh. Vaughn as well may have performed well in the role, however he was clearly not meant for it. One cannot simply jump from being a `swinger' to being a reserved, childish momma's boy. One of the many themes of `Psycho' is the idea that this sort of thing can happen to anybody. This is seen in the opening shot where the camera is weaving through the city, and randomly chooses a hotel room of a random high rise building. There we see two young lovers doing something that is for the most part human, although not ethical at this point in history. Merion the pockets a little cash to help her boyfriend get out of debt, so they could proceed to have a happy life together. Once again, although it is not ethical, it is not unheard of. On her way out of Phoenix Merion experiences some turbulent weather, forcing her to pull off to the side of the road to check into a motel. We all know what happens from there. The point is that it could have been any car pulling into that motel. Perhaps if another car had pulled in just before her, this never would have happened. It could have been your car. What makes `Psycho' one of the greatest thrillers of all time is audience identification. This is achieved through a series of point of view shots coming from the eyes of Merion, as well as an eerie score performed by Bernard Herrmann. This can be easily observed for the moment Merion gets in her car to leave town. By letting the audience look through the eyes of Merion, we the audience, essentially become her. The audience is in the mindset that we want her to get out of town unseen, and we hope that her boss doesn't think twice when he sees her on the road out of town. When the audience is introduced to the police officer, it is once again through the eyes of Merion. We feel her anxiety, and we want to get out of there just as much as she does. `Like her, we lose all power of rational control, and discover how easily a 'normal' person can lapse into a condition usually associated with neurosis' (Wood, 124). In the second half of the movie, the audience floats away from Merion, and to Norman. Although he has committed a harrowing act, we are still pulling for him to cover up each detail. For example, as he covers up the crime he committed, we see only hands mopping up the bathroom, our hands. The audience thinks, `Oh my, what have I done?' (Wood, 128). One thing that the remake of `Psycho' was able to do was let movie lovers realize how good of a film the original was. By assembling a perfect cast, interweaving a series of deep themes and ideas, as well as forcing the audience to identify, Hitchcock was able to take this simple film costing less than a million dollars and turn it into his masterpiece, as well as an all-time classic.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Greatest thriller of all time", "date": "2003-04-22T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0072264", "sentiment score": [0.0077, 0.0324, 0.0997, 0.5495, 0.3107]}, {"content": "Hitchcock was a master of his art, and this thriller is an evidence of it.

Norman takes care of Mother and, in return, she protects the disturbingly boyish man from temptation and corruption, particularly in the form of attractive single women who come to stay at the motel. Marion Crane stops at the Bates Motel after impulsively fleeing from her workplace with a large sum of stolen money. She had hoped this cash would allow her married lover, Sam Loomis, to marry her. After chatting with Norman, Marion appears to resolve to return the money. However, someone intervenes, leaving a bloody mess for Norman to clean up. After he's scrubbed down the bathroom, the dutiful son places the corpse in the trunk of Crane's traded car and sinks all the evidence in a nearby swamp. The situation gets tense for Norman when Marion's sister, Lila, Marion's lover, Sam, and private investigator Milton Arbogast arrive to ask some questions.\nThis movie is an all-time classic. Horror at it's finest. Mystery also at it's finest. Anthony Perkins was so good that I think that he should have been atleast nominated for an Academy Award.

Janet Leigh plays a secretary on the run after embezzling money from her boss. After a narrow escape from the law, she winds up at the run-down Bates Motel (and she was afraid of prison!) At this point, the movie takes a detour from its rather-tame opening half hour and takes viewers on a frightening ride of murder, madness, nagging mothers, stuffed birds, skeletons in cellars and ill-fated showers. Hitchcock's direction is top-notch, and the editing during the murder scenes is almost as schizophrenic as the title character. The only part that doesn't work quite so well anymore is the needlessly extended epilogue sequence, where a psychiatrist gives us all a lengthy explanation about split personalities and transvestism. But, otherwise, this should be studied as a textbook on how to make a horror film -- make the audience uncomfortable and uncertain, then gradually reduce their expectations and get them relaxed again, and then -- WHAM! -- knock them over the head with the flat side of an ax. Anthony Perkins (unsettlingly brilliant here, but forever-after typecast), as mama's boy Norman Bates, is the original, cinematic psycho killer and Leigh is the original scream queen. Also stars Vera Miles as Leigh's suspicious sister, John Gavin as the concerned lover, and Martin Balsam as the too-snoopy-for-his-own-good detective on the case. Aside from the infamous and oft-duplicated shower scene, there are a number of shocking and suspenseful sequences, and all of it is punctuated by Bernard Herrmann's classic, frightening score. Based on Robert Bloch's novel, who loosely based his character on real-life serial killer Ed Gein.HIGHLIGHT: The shower scene's too obvious, so I'll throw another one out here: The scene where Norman tries to get rid of a car with one of his victims inside by pushing it into a lake.

I remember the taunt from grade school, directed at introverted and overly sensitive boys who had little athletic vigor. Momma's boys were always objects of social opprobrium, because they were exceptions to the rule. Or were they? At the time that Hitchcock directed Psycho, Western society had been through several industrial revolutions, which removed the father from the traditional household industry, so that the sons received their fathers' discipline, not their teaching. And, lacking initiation rituals that removed older boys from their mothers and initiated them into the society of other men, most young men were insecure in their manhood, momma's boys who were wannabe men. Unlike the archetypal hero of Norse mythology, who stole the key to the wild man's cage from under his mother's pillow in order to free him, these men had never released the wild man from within themselves, from their mothers' control. And that's why Psycho is so terrifyingly brilliant: it taps into the hidden fears of a society in which young men enter adulthood overly attached to, and overly socialized by, their mothers. Psycho illustrates the hidden dangers of a fatherless Western society. Norman Bates, for example, the disturbed young man of Psycho, has twelve cabins, all empty. They represent his masculine development, perhaps even the twelve labors of Hercules, all of which have been usurped by his mother. He's content to leave the cabins unused, changing the sheets once a week, watching the sun rise and set every day without incident. He's totally emasculated by over attachment to his mother. Never having released the wild man, he's incredibly passive; but, his passivity is precisely why he's also a homicidal maniac. He's sensitive and overly delicate, unable to mention the toilet to a woman. If he had any male friends, he wouldn't be able to belch or fart in front of them. But his sexuality is so repressed that, when it breaks forth to the surface, it manifests itself as the fear of voyeurism or the angry control of violence. Is it a coincidence that, at the time the film was made, the larger society as a whole was becoming obsessed with pornography, which offers both voyeurism and the false empowerment of imaginary control? Is Norman Bates an aberrant microcosm of the rest of us? Is that why his character is so scary?Watch it for yourself, and decide for yourself.

Not just obvious films like William Castle's 'Homicidal' or Brian De Palma's 'Sisters' (and let's not even mention Gus Van Sant's misguided remake of some years back!), but Italian giallo and the whole slasher sub-genre wouldn't be the same without 'Psycho'. Even film makers outside the horror/suspense field have been influenced by it, Quentin Tarantino for example. One very famous shot in 'Psycho' is deliberately quoted in 'Pulp Fiction'. The cast of 'Psycho' are all very good, particularly Janet Leigh ('Touch Of Evil') and Vera Miles ('The Searchers') as the Crane sisters, and Martin Balsam ('Cape Fear') as Detective Arbogast.

She then decides to check into the Bates Motel and chats a bit with loner owner Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). She then takes a shower\u0085.Everybody knows the plot, everyone knows the shower scene. What most people also know is how great this film is. It's finely crafted with superior music and terrific acting all around, with some symbolism all around. First, the music.Bernard Herrmann, who produced the score for most of Hitch's other movies, did a top-notch job here, also. His strings orchestra really brought out the noir-ish mood. Even when Marion is just driving, you still feel tense because of his A+ score. The superimposed voice-overs that weren't very frequent were also quite good; it seemed like you couldn't tell whether Marion was thinking that or not. Hitchcock is a great directory; his camera shots and precise timing are superb. Most horror filmmakers try to carbon copy his style, but never succeed, because they don't have any of his wit and superiority. This is a fine craftsman at work.Perkins is eerily great. He manages to be vague and yet vulnerable. He's being overpowered by his overbearing mother who lives in the house behind the motel. He seems like he could be a nice guy\u0085until he snaps. Leigh is also great, along with Vera Miles (Marion's sister Lila), John Gavin (Marion's boyfriend Sam), and Martin Balsam (P.I.

It probably would have been a lot better if Gus Van Sant (who directed the new one) did a `reimagining', like Tim Burton and Planet of the Apes. Sure, William H. Macy is in the new one, but I've seen some of it and it's just horrible.Reading up online, I see some symbolism throughout the movie. Norman's obsession with birds (his middle name is Francis in the movie) means he wants to fly away from his mother. Something that I always love in movie is when they put `hints' of the movie in. For example, in the office where Marion works, there are two pictures: one of where she will be pulled over by a cop and one of a swamp that comes into play later. That type of stuff I always find fascinating.Look for Hitchcock's cameo (like he always has) as a man in a cowboy hat around four minutes into the movie, outside of Marion's office.My rating: 10/10Rated R for two scenes of violence.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Psycho: 10/10", "date": "2003-01-19T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0072245", "sentiment score": [0.0103, 0.0546, 0.1562, 0.5287, 0.2502]}, {"content": "I dont know.

He was a serial killer before there was such a thing in mainstream media...I even wonder if there was such a term as \"serial killer\" when the movie was filmed, (if anyone knows please let me know).A young woman stops at a roadside motel to spend the night, she meets an unassuming shy and attractive young man. She checks into her room and she takes her last shower. But the question is who kills her, is it Norman or his mother? Regardless of who it is, the point is that what happen isn't as far farfetched as hockey mask wearing madman or a halloween mask wearing escapee from a mental hospital, stalking his sister, Norman is really the boogie man. He is what goes bump in the night, he is the stranger that your mother told you not to get into his car! However unlike Bundy and the others, you actually find yourself feeling sorry for Norman Bates, he he truly tortured and definetely psychotic, but you really want to know why he is in such a state, what drove him to madness and then ultimately murder.Psycho was a rude awakening for movie audiences in the 60's, it was a lost of innocence. How appropriate that a movie that started off the 60's was a preview of things to come...the murders of Martin, Bobby, John, Malcom and Medger. The Vietnam War, the civil rights movement and race riots in Los Angeles and Detroit.

Because, let's face it, one way or another, you have seen or heard of this film. It's been made fun of, been remade(unfortunately), not to mention that this movie's word will be spred from generation to generation. I came across it very young, my parents used to tell me how scary it was and how I wouldn't want to take a shower after watching this film. I didn't believe them, but when I watched it, I for the first time pulled the blanket over my head, it was that frightening! The thing that is so amazing about Psycho is how much of an impact it made, and understandably why it did. It ranked in over 60 million dollars at the box office, now this was the time where tickets were like 50 cents at the theater, now if you compare that to today, that's Titanic like money! It broke many taboo's, like this was the first film to show a toilet being flushed, isn't that interesting? My high school teacher said that her and her mom saw Psycho when it was first released in theaters and she actually ran out of the theater terrified! Alfred did so well keeping us glued to our seats with all his great twists! This was before The Sixth Sense, I mean, the ending is just such a mind blower! But I won't give spoilers.Janet Leigh plays Marion Crane, a woman who is in love with a divorced man Sam Loomis. He says once he pays his ex wife off with the alimony, they'll get married. When Marion's boss asks her to put their most valued client's money, $40,000 to be exact, and bring it to the bank. She has other plans though, she takes the money for herself and flee's the city, but not before her boss sees her driving off. Shaky enough, huh? But she pulls over to get a nap in, and a police officer asks if she's OK, but she gets shaky and just wants to drive off. The policemen fallows her since she is so shaky and she ends up buying a different car. She gets caught in a giant rainstorm and pulls over to the Bates Motel.She meets there, the owner, a pleasant and polite young man, Norman Bates. He lives in the house next to the motel with his mother. Marion checks in and Norman offers her dinner, they have a conversation mostly about his mom and Marion is concerned when she heard screams from the house that sounded like his mom. Norman gets on the defenses and asks Marion some questions as well, she says she is going to a \"private island\". Norman is very attracted to her, you can tell immediately, and she leaves knowing that she has to get out of the trap she set for herself back in Phoenix. As she's taking a shower before bed, a mysterious figure comes to the curtain and opens it stabbing Marion violently several times causing her to die. Norman cleans up the mess and gets rid of her body not knowing about her money and throwing that away too.Marion's boyfriend, Sam and her sister, Lola, hire a private detective to find her. The private detective comes across The Bates Motel and doesn't end up coming back after trying to \"talk\" to the mother. Lola and Sam are concerned and decide to investigate for themselves, but will they end up coming back to the city alive? Psycho is just one of those movies you have to see before you die. It's one of the most important films of our time and will never be forgotten. It's a true treasure with terrific actors and a terrifying plot that will give you nightmares for weeks! Please don't let that scare you, I'm just having fun, but it is a freaky film! Watch it in the dark! It has a better effect, I think.

Nobody. And Hitch gets to show off the full scope of his directing talents with Psycho, his 1960 masterpiece of terror, suspense, drama and mystery. Drawing the audience in from the first scene, seriously screwing with their minds, then throwing them back out again, the Master of Suspense more than lives up to his prestigious title.In a classic bit of directorial finesse, Hitchcock throws the audience for one of the biggest loops in movie history 50 minutes into the movie. Until then, the film has focused on Janet Leigh's character and the money-stealing plot. Who knew she would die so suddenly? From there the movie goes on to focus on the likable yet obviously troubled Norman Bates and his somewhat suspicious relationship with his mysterious mother.Toying with our emotions like no one else could, Hitch forces us to root for Norman through the rest of the movie, even to a subconcious degree. We know that Norman is covering up a murder, but, admit it, when that car was sinking in the swamp and it stopped, you wanted it to go all the way down just as much as Norman, didn't you? Taken on an intellectual standpoint, this movie can make you question your morals, beliefs, and ethics. Or you can just relax and let it scare the hell out of you. Both ways are equally effective.Words like \"thrilling,\" and \"disturbing\" are thrown around a lot these days. However, this movie inarguably sets the standard by which \"thrilling\" and \"disturbing\" movies will forever be measured.

My grandma, a big Hitchcock fan, used to class it as one of her favourite films of all time, and I used to always see it on the 'Horror' or 'Thriller' shelves of the video store. I guess I knew that it would be good, but never really wanted to get it, as it was old for my generation, being made in 1960, and it was in black and white. Films like that just don't suit most kids in my generation. When I first discovered the IMDB a few years back, I saw it in the Top 250, and thought that it would have to be good. And just yesterday, in fact, I finally got around to seeing it, and was I in for a treat.The film starts off with Phoenix bank worker, Marion Crane (portrayed very well by a young Janet Leigh) spending her lunchtime with her boyfriend who owns the hardware store, Sam Loomis. They both want to get married, but Sam has to pay his ex-wife's alimony, and Marion isn't exactly Bill Gates. That day at work, Marion is given $40,000 in cash by a man who is purchasing a new house for his daughter who is getting married. Her boss tells her to put it in the safe, and they'll get him to give them a cheque on Monday, as they can't have that kind of money just lying around. After work, Marion takes the money with her, and runs off. It is raining very heavily, and she can't see where she is going. She takes a wrong turn off the highway, and ends up at a place called The Bates Motel, where she decides to stay for the night. There, she meets a nice young man by the name of Norman Bates, who runs the motel, while his 'mother' lives in the house up the hill from the Bates Motel. At first, Norman seems like a nice enough guy, but soon, Marion discovers that he is rather peculiar, and may not be all he is cracked up to be. When Marion does not come into work on Monday, and the money is gone, Sam and her sister Lila investigate, as does a Private Detective Arbogast, who has cracked onto Norman, and learns that kindness is only skin deep.The ending was not a surprise to me, as I had already read a review of it by someone who hadn't bothered to put a spoiler warning on it, and it was not as much of a shock to me as it could have been, so even though I have put a warning above my review, I will not ruin the awesome ending for those of you who have not yet had the pleasure of viewing this cinematic gem. Hitchcock chose to film in black and white to give it more of a scary feel, and he has done a great job.

You actually find yourself sympathizing with Norman, which you really don't do with movies of its kind. Janet Leigh was great as Marion Crane, as well. Another thing: ALFRED HITCHCOCK. He is by far the greatest director of all time. All of his films were brilliant, and you always found yourself on the edge of your seat during the major climactic scenes.

I was pleasantly surprised to see that the film was even better than I'd remembered. It may be my favorite film from the master of suspense, Alfred Hitchcock.\nGiven the fact that horror films have become increasingly macabre and disturbing over the years, \"Psycho\" does seem to have lost much of it's ability to frighten the viewer. Just imagine how this movie must have effected audiences in 1960. They'd never seen anything remotely close to this. I wish I could have been there.Sadly, I'm a member of the younger generation, who has had the plot twists and famous moments spoiled for me. I can't appreciate the shower scene as much as most people because I probably saw dozens of rip-offs and spoofs of it before seeing the real thing. I was immune to being truly shocked by \"Psycho\", but it's an amazing experience, nonetheless.Besides Hitchcock's ingenious direction, the key reason for the film's greatness is Anthony Perkins. He totally masters the psychotic Norman Bates with understated nervousness and desperation. Bates is the true main character of the film, and we can identify with him more than we can with any of the other characters.I don't find \"Psycho\" to be terrifying; it's more thrilling and fun than scary. There are a few ominous moments to be found, though. My favorite is the final scene, with Bates in the asylum. It is genuinely uncomfortable to look at as the camera slowly zooms in closer to Bates' facial expressions, leaving the viewer in a state of claustrophobia. His final grin at the camera is truly spine tingling and unforgettable. It's one of the many images in \"Psycho\" that is imbedded in my mind.There is only one set of scenes in the movie which I find to be a bit tedious, and that would be Norman's clean-up of the bathroom. Not that it isn't necessary, it just seems as if we see him doing more cleaning than we really need to.

When Norman's mother first does the killing he has no idea what he is doing because the \"mother\" in him takes over and Norman blacks out and after he awakens he cleans up the bloody mess in which he believes that his mother has commited.

It began in 1960 with the release of Alfred Hitchcock's all-time masterpiece PSYCHO.The story of Marion Crane stopping off at the Bates Motel and taking the shower which would live in cinematic history and infamy is so well known that no regurgitation of the plot is necessary. But what is important to know about PSYCHO is the fact that it introduced a number of important elements to the genre that had never been used before. It introduced us to the \"slasher\", in the form of Anthony Perkins' off-balance Norman Bates and his \"Mother.\" It bought the horror film firmly into contemporary times by being set in the present. It also took a very unique approach to psychology and murder in a way that no film had done before, and few films have done since.What is the most significant about PSYCHO's celebrated shower murder, besides the literal knife-edge editing and Bernard Herrmann's classic shrieking strings, is the way Hitchcock depicts this scene. So many slasher films entirely miss the point of that scene, focusing only on the (limited) blood. But Hitchcock manipulates the film in such a way as to make this scene LOOK much more graphic than it really is. It is a brilliant feat of movie-making on the part of the cinema's ultimate Master Of Suspense.Even the much-criticized final scene involving the psychiatrist (Simon Oakland) isn't very bothersome; he brings up the first real honest-to-goodness explanation of a disturbed killer. As he relates Norman's story, he tells the group there in the room, \"He was never all Norman. But he was often ONLY Mother.\"Scripted by Joseph Stefano from Robert Bloch's novel of the same name, and loosely based on the case of Wisconsin mass murderer Ed Geinn (which also inspired the 1974 cult masterpiece THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE), PSYCHO remains a masterpiece to this very day, even after more than four decades of sequels, imitators, imitators of imitators, and an atrocious remake.

But the reason for that isn't Hitchcock, it's the cast and story. Hitchcock is the kind of director who succeeds best when his movies deal strictly with person to person situations, and \"Psycho\" does this best. I have seen many, many Hitchcock movies and my peak of interest in all of these movies is when there is an intriguing situation between two or more people, such as the one-sided murder plot and its resulting conflict in \"Strangers On a Train,\" and the attempts of Barry Kane in \"Saboteur\" to clear his name of sabotage. However, in the case of these two movies and many other Hitchcock films, the person to person situation is almost destroyed by an overly large climax that is ridiculously corny. The merry-go-around scene in \"Strangers On a Train\" is an embarassment, and the Statue of Liberty scene in \"Saboteur\" is a few steps too far. Other bad climaxes include the hilariously bad fall Jimmy Stewart has at the end of \"Rear Window,\" and the lackluster mountain climax in \"North by Northwest.\" \"Psycho,\" however, avoids these kinds of climaxes. \"Psycho\" stays on a person to person level throughout the entire movie and does not include a terribly corny ending (unless you count Norman being able to perfectly imitate an old lady's voice). Considering the odd set-up, a man assuming the role of his mother, the story of \"Psycho\" is executed rather realistically. Also (and I don't mean to slam Hitchcock) \"Psycho\" contains far more realistically portrayed characters than any other Hitchcock film. In other Hitchcock films, only one or two characters have any depth, while in \"Psycho\" there are five characters (Norman, Marion, Lila, Arbogast, and Sam) that have depth (though John Gavin's performance is a little stiff). Even supporting characters like Al Chambers and the detective at the end are very believable. Pat Hitchcock, however, as Marion's friend at work, does her part in destroying depth (as she did in \"Strangers On a Train\"). But most of the scenes in \"Psycho\" are very well-acted, especially the questioning scene between Arbogast and Norman and their light-weight argument outside. As usual, \"Psycho\" contains the Hitchcock knack for irony (\"The first customer of the day is always the most troubled,\" and \"Insect or man, death should always be painless), but, for the most part the realistic performances save the movie from too-much corniness and truly make it one of the finest movies ever made (one of my top five). 5 stars out of 5. The underrated \"Psycho II,\" (released in 1983) contains excellent performances all around and contains no irony whatsoever.

Everyone is familiar with the famous shower scene. Bernard Herrmann's score evokes memories and moods instantly. Psycho is a film masterpiece. It is a wonderfully chilly tale of sexual repression, of madness, of the effects that living alone can have on an individual, and finally on the rural aspects of horror in the life of rural America. It is a cheaply made film, but accomplishes so much with so little. The credit goes to a handful of people. First and foremost in this group stands the master of suspense himself, Alfred Hitchcock. It is Hitchcock's best film in terms of utilizing the minimal for the most shocking scenes ever filmed. His shower scene is forever etched into the mindset of people all over the world. When the film came out, people were afraid to take showers afterward for quite awhile. The camera lens sets the pace for the film, and my favourite scene is Janet Leigh driving in the car. Extremely well-shot scenes with a steady current of tension. Hitchcock was ably assisted by all concerned. Herrmann's score is awesome. Joseph Stefano did a wonderful job adapting the wonderful novel by horror legend Robert Bloch. The acting is first-rate. Anthony Perkins did such a good job that he never could escape the role of Norman Bates. Martin Balsam, Vera Miles, even John Gavin do credible jobs. Janet Leigh is very good, and looks quite fetching and provocative in a black brassiere. Watch for cameos by Simon Oakland(from The Night Stalker fame) and Ted Knight as a guard.

It's often the little things that make a film work. Here are a few examples:a.) The absolute realism of the first twenty minutes of so, which are so true to life that they might have come from a documentary on how people lived in America forty years ago. There isn't a false note,--or a missed one--as each vocal inflection and raised eyebrow carries great meaning even if, on the surface, not much appears to be happening.b.) Marion and the motorcycle cop. The cop is dark and sinister in appearance, due mostly to the bright desert sun, and never takes off his sunglasses. His conduct is at all times professional; he never raises his voice, and comes across as calm and rather perceptive; and he seems truly concerned over Marion Crane's fate, though he is unaware of her actual predicament. Marion is, alas, a bad actress, and the cop sees through this, if not to the heart of the matter, yet we don't want him to follow her. Despite his appearance the cop is not the angel of death but rather Marion's last chance. Had she confessed to her crime she would have escaped the fate that awaited her; and if she had just been a little less clever, and driven more slowly, and the skies remained clear, he might have followed her to the motel and intervened on her behalf.c.) California Charlie. John Anderson is wonderful as the fast-talking, semi-streetwise small town used car salesman. At the end of almost every other line of dialogue he seems on the verge of discovering who Marion really is, then pulls back or comes to the wrong conclusion. He senses that she is being watched by the cop; but he also wants to make a sale. The scenes at the used car lot are both highly realistic,--and perfectly acted and timed--and also a little frightening, from the opening, \"I'm in no mood for trouble\", to the final \"hey!\" just before Marion drives away. We know that something isn't right, but the problem isn't with the car lot; it's Marion's plight casts a dark shadow over all her scenes there, despite the brightest sunlight imaginable.d.) Chitchat with Norman. Once Marion and Norman settle down for a light meal in the parlor their conversation turns to general things, and Norman is a good observer, if a bit awkward socially. Without actually lying Marion gives herself away with a throwaway line (\"Sometimes just once is enough\", in a reference to private traps) and Norman seems to catch her drift, if not the actual meaning of what she's saying, and allows it to pass. We can see that he is moody when he angrily leans forward and delivers an angry, though controlled tirade against putting people in institutions. Every camera angle and line of dialogue in this scene has meaning and carries enormous weight, and yet the drama plays out in a light, relaxed mode, and the performers seems truly connected to one another at its conclusion, strangers no more. This is in my opinion the best written and most beautifully acted, edited and photographed scene I have ever seen in a movie. The handling of every nuance is prodigal and masterful, and the end result nothing less than staggering.e.) The sheriff's house. When Sam and Lila wake up the sheriff and his wife in the middle of the night we see a splendid example of people talking to one another without either party understanding what is in fact going on. The result is a mini-comedy of manners; but it is also good exposition, as we learn of Mrs. Bates' death (and the dress she was buried in, \"periwinkle blue\"). John McInyre's sheriff dominates this scene (and no other), and expertly delivers its punchline, \"Well if that's Mrs. Bates in the window, who's that buried up in Greenlawn Cemetary\".f.) Arbogast and Norman. The private detective's interview with Norman is played low-key, and yet we sense the tension in Norman's voice and manner, and know that Arbogast does, too. Something is amiss. This is beyond the question of who killed Marion. The stakes feel very high in this sparring match, and though Norman wins on a technicality, we know that Arbogast is coming back for more.g.) The shrink's explanation. This part of the film has been criticized by many for being a sop thrown to the audience. I disagree. After all, the movie came out in 1960, and by the standards of the time some explanation seems in order, and Dr. Simon Oakland is as good a man for the job as I can imagine. His analysis of Norman's pathology is cogent and extremely well delivered. Yet throughout his speech, with all its Freudian brilliance, the doctor offered a take on the story that we in the audience, even if we can accept it, can never be satisfied with. He can explain the character of Norman Bates rationally, but he cannot make our response to his story and its effect on us feel ultimately safe, feel somehow in control and finalized. Yes, one can put people like Norman under the microscope, and even dissect what one sees, but this doesn't stop such events as unfolded in the movie any less likely to occur. Ask Milton Arbogast.\nIn conclusion I'd like to say that great films are made up of outstanding little things, not just big moments or fancy effects. There is in fact nothing fancy about Psycho, which is on the surface is a somewhat plain-looking movie. Only when one looks beneath the surface does one see the teeming millions of small things,--gestures, glances, sudden changes in lighting, razor-sharp editing, and all above the refusal on the part of the director to let any one factor dominate--that we understand the meaning of the word genius, the meaning of the word creative.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 348, "votes": 369}, "heading": "It's the Little Things", "date": "2001-09-05T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0072083", "sentiment score": [0.0115, 0.0604, 0.1827, 0.5359, 0.2095]}, {"content": "Psycho is the best horror and slasher film ever made!

However, there are certain elements which make this film the best horror movie of all time.Considering the era (1960) Hitchcock used innovative camera angles to build up the tension and fear in Psycho. For example at the beginning the camera pans down on the motel giving the impression that the house is watching the motel. This personification (that the house is alive) is used again when Marion's sister (Lila) approaches the house near the end. The camera changes from objective to subjective numerous times to give the impression that the house is watching Lila. More camera actions which are innovative is when Bates and Crane are talking over supper. The low camera angle gives the impression that Norman Bates is bigger and therefore more menacing. This is an early indication of the horror which is to come. These are just examples of the clever use of camera.The music and lightening is a major strength of the film. For example when there is the scene with the corpse the mummified mother is a mixture of dark and light. This represents the good and evil side of Norman. Moreover, there is light shining at the backs of the eye sockets which makes the corpse appear alive. Hitchcock innovated with the signature tune (\"screeching violins\") and that builds up the suspense. Such directors as Speilberg have copied this idea (e.g. Jaws)Symbolism is a good part of this film. For example Bates has an unusual hobby of stuffing birds. By analyzing Anthony Perkins performance he perches on the edge of his chair as if he is a bird seeking his prey (i.e. Crane). He also acts like a bird when he twitches his head from time to time. Another clever use of symbolism is when Lila picks up the book in the Psycho house. She is unsure which side is what as they are equally patterned. This represents Norman's character; you can't determine his side as he has two personalities. More symbolism is Marion's change in underwear when she packs her case; white represents purity and black represents evil/wrong doing. Symbolism like this is also used when the camera shows the stuffed bird towering over Bates when he becomes uneasy with Marion's conversation. This represents his mother watching over him and changing his personality. By watching the film other examples of symbolism can be depicted throughout.What made Psycho so remarkable at the time was realism. The setting was a realistic place and familiar to American and worldwide audiences (i.e the motel, the city - Phoenix, Arizona) rather than fictional places like Transylvania. Also, Norman had a medical condition (he was a psychopath). This was a breakaway from the previous unrealistic films, such as Dracula. This made the film even more frightening and people were scared that such events could occur with \"real\" people. Also what was realistic about this film was that the characters were neither \"goodies\" or \"baddies\" - they had transformations. Marion was a mixture of good and bad (the color of her underwear she chooses represents this and the color of the car she buys.) This makes the film more realistic as it shows that people all have good and bad in them, which is true.Moreover what stood out in the film was what happened to Janet Leigh. She was killed of very early into the film and this shocked audiences that the A-list Hollywood actress was so brutally murdered. This is nearly on a par with what Drew Barrymore chose to do for Scream when she chose to be Casey. This fact shows Hitchcock has influenced the thinking for other horror movies.Therefore, although you will be better of with Scream or Scary Movie to scare you this film is an example of cinematography at its best.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 2}, "heading": "The best horror movie of all time", "date": "2001-08-04T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0072070", "sentiment score": [0.0079, 0.0447, 0.2416, 0.5339, 0.1718]}, {"content": "Yes, everything you've heard is true.

Nothing even comes close...maybe \"Les Diaboliques\" (1955) but not really.\"Psycho\" has one of the best scripts you'll ever find in a movie. The movie's only shortcoming is that one of the characters seems to have little motivation in the first act of the movie but as the story progresses, you realize that Hitchcock (GENIUS! GENIUS! GENIUS!) in a stroke of genius has done this on purpose, because there is another character whose motivations are even more important. Vitally important. So important that you totally forget about anything else. I was lucky enough to have spent my life wisely avoiding any conversation regarding the plot of this movie until I was able to see it in full. Thank God I did! The movie has arguably the best mid-plot point and climactic twist in thriller history, and certainly the best-directed ending. The last few shots are chilling and leave a lingering horror in the viewer's mind.Just as good as the writing is Hitchcock's direction, which is so outstanding that it defies explanation. Suffice it to say that this movie is probably the best directorial effort by film history's best director. I was fortunate enough to see this movie at a big oldtime movie house during a Hitchcock revival. Janet Leigh, still radiant, spoke before the film and explained how Hitchcock's genius was in his ability to 1) frighten without gore and 2) leave his indelible mark on the movie without overshadowing his actors (like the great Jean Renoir could never do). \"Psycho\" is clearly its own phenomenon, despite all the big-name talent involved.Hitchcock does not disappoint by leaving out his trademark dark humor. His brilliance is in making a climax that is at once both scary and hilarious. When I saw it in the theatre the audience was both gasping in disbelief while falling-on-the-floor laughing.One more thing...Tony Perkins. Janet Leigh got much-deserved accolades for this film, but it is Perkins who gives what remains the single best performance by an actor in a horror movie. He is so understated that his brillance passes you by. He becomes the character. The sheer brillance of the role is evidenced by the ineptitude of the actors in Gus Van Sant's 1998 (dear God make it stop!) shot-for-shot \"remake.\" Though the movies are nearly identical, Hitchcock's is superior mostly because of the acting and the atmosphere (some of the creepiness is lost with color). This is made obvious by the initial conversation between Leigh's character and Perkins, a pivotal scene. The brilliance of Perkins in the original shines even brighter when compared with the ruination in the remake even though the words and the shots were exactly the same. The crucial chemistry in this scene lacking in the remake gives everything away and mars our understanding of upcoming events. The fact that Perkins could never escape this role - his star stopped rising star as it had done in the 50s - proves that he played the part perhaps too well.I keep using the word brilliant, but I cannot hide my enthusiasm for this movie.

Gavin's practically nonexistent screen appeal reminds me of those anemic actors in \"Strangers on a Train\".

Its effect is maximized by skillful build-up and by the atmosphere that Hitchcock so carefully created. The pacing is masterful, slowly building up the tension and only releasing it when it will have the maximum effect - that is why it creates such a sensation. The main settings - the Bates Motel and the Bates' old house - are perfectly designed to create an atmosphere full of possibilities. (Hitchcock also made a terrific trailer in which he took the viewer on a tour of the house and motel.) And it is not possible to say enough about the famous Bernard Herrmann score, which always fits the mood and action perfectly. The exciting music makes even the opening credits fun to watch.The fine cast is led by Anthony Perkins, who is simply outstanding in a very challenging role. The movie would not have been quite the same without his underplayed but thoroughly memorable performance.

It's the ship that launched a thousand blood-spurting imitators, although that was never Alfred Hitchcock's intent. Unfortunately, 90 per cent of those writers and directors inspired by his unprecedented work in \"Psycho\" never got past the initial primitive thrill of seeing on-screen violence for the first time. They didn't \"get\" the homework that went into this brilliantly macabre masterpiece. Just what DID make the infamous shower scene and \"Mother\" Bates' stairwell confrontation so shockingly memorable, other than providing front row forum seats to the carnage?With \"Psycho,\" the master of suspense would tempt us to enter the intricate, insidious mind of a violent, psychotic killer, something he surely tampered around with in \"Strangers On a Train.\" Hitch himself created the essential tool kit for modern day terror \u0096 implementing story, set-up, characterization, photography, camera technique, mood and music in order to weave an elaborate spider's web that would playfully entice, then seduce his intended victim, the audience.Norman Bates will forever be enshrined as THE infamous poster boy of cinematic psychosis. As expounded by Simon Oakland's psychiatrist in the last reel, Norman was an isolated, terrified, severely undernourished man-child consumed by a hideously abnormal fear of change. In the end, the self-suffocating Norman lashed out like a wild, kicking, screaming child at a world he never knew or understood. Smart enough to distance himself and the Bates Motel as far from the highway of humanity as possible, it still wasn't far enough. For somewhere down the line, fate, coincidence, or maybe just a primal need for human contact, would inevitably lead a John Doe (or Marion Crane) to his door.The most compelling scene for me is when the verrrrrry brave Lila Crane sneaks into the decrepit Bates' house behind the motel to investigate her suspicions as to sister Marion's disappearance. After coyly tormenting us throughout the first three-fourths of the movie, Hitch finally lets us in on the equally decrepit world of Norman Bates and his mother. Norman's bedroom holds the key elements to his enslaved childhood. The pathetic little bed with his careworn stuffed animal nearby, the little phonograph with Beethoven's \"Eroica\" record in place. It's such a private, eerily invasive moment that one feels guilty for possessing this natural \u0091Peeping Tom' curiosity.Seeing Norman huddled up looking maniacally serene, immured within the confines of a \"new\" prison and armed only with a security blanket, you know that the poor innocent fly that lands on his hand, a fly he promises to respect, will never see the light of day again. And neither will Norman...despite the inferior sequels that tried to alter his obvious fate.We can only thank Anthony Perkins for sacrificing a brilliant, promising, and highly versatile film career after bestowing upon us the most definitive, sympathetic creature of violence ever to assault the eyes. There will never be another one like him. Janet Leigh, one of Hollywood's biggest, fluffiest stars at this juncture, graciously cut short a dramatic \"starring\" role and instead offered us the screen's most tragic golden girl of all time. Both of their sacrifices were rewarded with film immortality.I was introduced to \"Psycho\" at the age of 9. My older brother and I had the option one night of seeing \"Psycho\" or Jerry Lewis' \"Cinderfella\" at the local Riviera Theater. I wanted Jerry Lewis but my older brother had clout and, of course, won out. Needless to say I lost a good portion of my innocence (and my hair!) that night, succumbing to the frequent nightmares and shower traumas that obviously accompany such a youthful experience. Oh, yes, there is that abnormal fear I developed of screeching violin strings...On a bright note, my faith in today's horror suspense was restored after experiencing the bravura Shyamalan-directed \"The Sixth Sense\" and \"The Blair Witch Project\" a raw, but creepy and effective little thriller filmed on a pittance. Both took stock of Hitchcock's tool kit for terror. \"Blair Witch\" proves once again that the real horror of shock films today lie not in its low-grade budgets, but in its third-grade scripts and mentality.Alfred Hitchcock opened our eyes in awe, wonderment and, yes, horror.

It is simply a fantastic screenplay that keeps me on the edge of my seat at all times.This is Hitchcock's best work as a director in my opinion. Though he rarely made a bad film, most of Hitch's films are commercially-directed. I think of North By Northwest, Suspicion, Notorious and The Man Who Knew Too Much as examples. Though each is a fantastic film, they are not terribly stimulating too watch and have minimal artistic merit. Psycho, by contrast, is a true work of art.

So much of it has become clich\u00e9 in the four decades since its release, including the famous shower scene, Perkins' oedipal relationship with his mother, and even Bernard Herrmann's unsettling score. I had known the identity of Perkins' \"mother\" even before I saw the film and had to be told by a sibling that the audience was not supposed to be aware of this up to the last. It was like knowing the punch line in advance and not really getting the joke once it was actually told. It is, to be sure, a tribute to Hitchcock that this film has become so much a part of North American popular culture, but the downside is that the element of shock that so affected audiences back in 1960 is almost entirely lost on a later generation of viewers. One thus has to imagine what it would have been like to see it during its first run in the movie theatres.Had I been there at its opening, I think I would still have judged this film to be inferior to the string of excellent Hitchcock offerings preceding it during the previous decade\u0096from \"Strangers on a Train\" to \"North by Northwest.\" Why? So much of his previous work had relied on the use of suspense to draw the viewers into the plot. A good thriller builds this up carefully and deliberately until the final climax at or near the end of the film. Good suspense leaves much unstated and works its way subtly into the imagination. It's what you don't see that's the scariest. Think, for example, of the murder in \"Rear Window.\" You hear a crash and a short, shrill scream followed by ominous silence, but you're not really sure what's happened until much later. Here, on the other hand, Hitch kills off his heroine brutally near the beginning of the film, leaving little if anything to the imagination, and largely putting aside the issues we had been misled to think the plot was building up to.Moreover, despite Hitch's tongue-in-cheek claim that he had intended it as a comedy, there is little of the director's famous humour so much in evidence in the immediately preceding film, \"North by Northwest.\" There is not much humour to be found in shock, while there is great humorous potential in suspense. He should have stuck with suspense and left shock to a lesser director.I alluded to Herrmann's score. Without it, I think this would have been judged a far less effective film and less the classic it is generally reputed to be. Imagine Leigh driving along the highway without the composer's jittery music in the background\u0096or, perhaps more accurately, the foreground. In such scenes it is the music that almost entirely creates the suspenseful atmosphere. Without it there is nothing of the sort\u0096just Leigh driving and looking in her rear view mirror. Period. Not very scary.Is it a classic then? It is, insofar as it influenced a whole generation of movie-goers and film makers who sought to imitate it.

And now-- forty years later-- even in an age of jaded, desensitized sensibilities, graphic horror and the likes of Hannibal Lecter and `American Psycho,' Hitchcock's masterpiece remains, even after repeated viewings, truly frightening and intrinsically disturbing. Just as Ingmar Bergman did with his character of Karin in his landmark film, `Through A Glass, Darkly,' Hitchcock presents a character (Bates) at the psychological crossroads of his life, a pivotal juncture wherein he is required to make a conscious decision that will determine the course of the rest of his life: Whether to reach for the light (and healing), or succumb to the voices beckoning to him from the dark, a place from which there will be no return. Norman, however--like karin-- is incapable of making that decision, and ultimately must adhere to the resolution of the subconscious, which takes him past the point of no return and subsequently beyond the reach of any help forevermore. The rest of the characters in the story-- Marion Crane, Lila, Sam Loomis, Arbogast-- are all mere pawns who happen to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and are forced by fate to help play out the drama of Norman's twisted existence. \tJanet Leigh gives a memorable performance as Marion, creating a character that was not only destined to go down in cinematic history, but one that would make women everywhere afraid to shower at a motel. Vera Miles is effective as Marion's sister, Lila, and John Gavin gives credibility to Marion's lover, Sam Loomis. Martin Balsam gives a solid performance as well, as Arbogast, the ill-fated Private Eye whose encounter with Norman's mother on the stairs is a scene nearly as famous as that of Marion's `shower.' But the real star of the film is, of course, Anthony Perkins, who gives an Oscar worthy performance as Norman Bates, a character even more chilling than Hannibal Lecter, in that his outward appearance is so deceiving, so contrary to the evil dwelling behind his unintended facade of normalcy. His gentle countenance and boyish charm are so `real' that after being exposed to him it forever after makes anyone and everyone you encounter in your own life suspect. And Perkins plays him to perfection, in arguably the best (and definitely the most memorable) performance of his career. \tThe supporting cast includes John McIntire (Sheriff Chambers), Simon Oakland (Dr. Richmond), Vaughn Taylor (George Lowery), Frank Albertson (Tom Cassidy), Lurene Tuttle (Mrs. Chambers), Patricia Hitchcock (Caroline), John Anderson (Charlie) and Mort Mills (Highway Patrolman). If there was any doubt by the time this film was made, `Psycho' once and for all proved that Hitchcock was, indeed, the Master of Suspense. There have been many imitators before and since, but all of them, good and bad alike, only serve to point out that nobody does it better than Hitchcock.

One of the more famous settings ever (the motel), one of the most famous movie names (Norman Bates), and of course, probably the most memorable killing on film (shower, anyone?). There's no real point in summing up again, but, what the hay. Leigh embezzels money and skips town. She ends up at a remote motel and has dinner with the owner (Perkins). Though long winded, the scene in the parlor stays captivating with the dialogue and the subtle music softly in the background. They both discuss the things wrong in their lives, his biggest problem, his domineering \"mother\" (and I always wondered if people who haven't seen the film thought of when every critic always put quotations around mother). She retires for the night, and while unwinding with a shower, is brutally knifed by some woman. The mother? You'll find out if you haven't seen it. The rest of the film deals with Perkins trying to cover up the crime, as others come looking for Leigh. I say it's Hitchcocks best, but that's mostly based on the fact that I didn't like his other movies (\"Frenzy\" was ok). Performance wise, you couldn't ask for much more, as Perkins is terrifically understated as Norman, the role that pidgeon-holed the rest of his career. He pretty much carries the film as the others, good actors no doubt, have little screen time. A sequel followed 23 years later(!), one I went for more being a kid of the 80s. Part III was good as well (Perkins directed nicely), but IV was a lame made for cable film. There was also an awful remake in 98, check it out at your own risk.

Anyone interested in learning how to develop dramatic, and/or psychological tension, should study this scene. Sharp dialog, mood swings, marvelous camera angles and great character reactions permeate the scene. Much of the scene, and it's darkly humorous lines, hint at the truth about Norman and his mother without actually revealing it. For example, as Norman is bringing the tray of food into the office for Marian after an argument with mother, he says, \"My mother is ...what's the phrase...she isn't quite herself today\". In the parlor while Marian eats, Norman defends his mother with, \"We all go a little mad sometimes\". And just before Marian leaves the office she tells Norman, \"I stepped into a private trap back there. I'd like to go back and pull myself out of it...if it's not too late\". The irony being that Marian may have decided to try to escape her trap, but she has already, unknowingly been ensnared in Norman's private trap. Yes Marian, it is too late.In another sequence while Norman and Marian are talking in the parlor, the camera is at eye level on both characters. Suddenly, when Marian brings up the subject of Norman's mother, the camera angle changes. Norman is now being viewed from a lower angle. We are looking up at Norman and, in the background, his stuffed owl with it's wings spread, clearly in an attack posture. At the same time, we are now seeing Marian at slight downward angle. Norman has become the predator and Marian the prey!Now, how about lighting? In a scene very near the end of the film, Marian's sister has made her way into the fruit cellar, lit by one bare bulb, where mother sits in a wheelchair. Lila touches her shoulder, the wheelchair swings around revealing mother's well preserved corpse. Lila screams and draws her hand back hitting the light bulb, causing it to swing wildly. The end result is that the remainder of the scene is played out in alternating light and shadow due to the swinging bulb: Lila's terrified face, mother's corpse, Norman running into the cellar in mother's clothes wielding a butcher's knife, Sam running in behind Norman and dragging him to the floor, Norman's face becoming a twisted mask of despair as the knife falls to the floor and the wig slips from his head. It all has the look of a nightmare...macabre, surreal, and sheer genius!I have always loved Hitch's brand of humor, dark or otherwise. Here are some of my favorites from this film: Marian talking to Sam in the motel room at the beginning of the film, \"You make respectability sound...disrespectful\". Charlie the used car salesman, speaking to Marian, who is obviously intent on trading in her car, \"First time I ever saw the customer high pressure the salesman\". Arbogast, the private detective, speaking to Norman at the motel, \"If it doesn't gel, it isn't aspic...and this ain't gelling\". Norman speaking to Sam, after Sam has implied that Marian may have made a fool of him, \"She might have fooled me, but she didn't fool my mother\". Lila to Sam, defending her decision to try to talk to Norman's mother, \"I can handle a sick, old woman\". How about the fact that Norman's hobby is stuffing birds, and in cleaning up mother's mess he stuffs a \"Crane\" into the trunk of a car. Classic Hitch!Let me leave you with one last tidbit. In the final scene of the film Norman is sitting in a cell, wrapped in a blanket, and we hear mother's thought that is the last line of the film, \"Why, she wouldn't even harm a fly\". The scene then dissolves to a shot of Marian's car being dragged from the swamp. Just as Norman's image disappears from the screen, look closely and you will see the face of mother's corpse superimposed over Norman's face for a fraction of a second.

From the beginning theme to the last view of Marion's car being pulled from the swamp, this movie is outstanding. Hitch really knew how to fool around with the audience and created some terrifying moments that still scare even after 40 years. The shower scene still scares me!

There is a difference between a great film, where the cast and technicians seem inspired and the project is carried along on the energy of its ideas, and a merely good film, in which the cleverness is calculated, and the tricks are consciously inserted. \"Psycho\" is merely a good film. But what cleverness! The incidental music of Bernard Herrman, Hitchcock's composer of choice, has a discordant, staccato leitmotif in the strings which repeats constantly, building almost hypnotically towards the shrill climax of the shower scene. Hitchcock deploys a battery of subtle devices to keep the viewer feeling vaguely uneasy. Sexual frankness was a shocking thing in a mainstream movie in 1960, and the opening scene (showing Marion's \"extended lunch hour\" with Sam) is so sexually honest that it cannot have failed to disturb contemporary cinema audiences. Faces are lit from below or the side, creating an inchoate sense of foreboding. Owls and ravens, traditional omens of evil, preside silently over Norman's parlour. The windshield wiper which fails to clear the rain is a symbol of Marion's guilty conscience. The film's abiding mood is one of creepy uneasiness, and this is reinforced at every turn by Hitchcock's system of visual imagery. There is, of course, the Old Dark House, but far less obvious techniques are also at work. As Arbogast mounts the stairs, the camera retreats disconcertingly before him. The tines of the rakes in Sam's store are raised like bony, clutching fingers behind Lila's head. Marion's unblinking eyeball is compositionally echoed by the circular plughole, the water draining out as her life force ebbs away. In the long dialogue scene between Norman and Marion (\"We all go a little mad sometimes\"), the rhythm of the cutting is exquisite. Sometimes we see the speaker, sometimes the listener, as the rapidity of the cuts forms a counterpoint to the text, and emphasises the discomfort of the characters (Marion wary but self-possessed, Norman outwardly affable but painfully shy). The cinematic axiom, \"Show it, don't tell it\", is beautifully illustrated in the scene in Marion's bedroom. The camera closes in on the bundles of banknotes lying on the bed, then pans to the packed suitcase, telling us without the need for words that she has decided to take the money and run. Then something puzzling happens. The film seems to lose all belief in its own precepts, and the rich visual symbolism is abruptly abandoned. Lila opines, \"I'll feel better when all this is explained,\" but she is wrong. The explanation is a huge let-down. We get Dr. Simon, a psychiatrist, lecturing us at tedious length about Norman's condition. \"Show it, don't tell it\" flies out of the window. Maybe Stefano, the scriptwriter, realised that the running time was already over two hours and the thing needed its loose ends tied up rapidly. Perhaps the flat, prosaic ending is the price Hitch has to pay for the slow painstaking build-up in the early reels (it is almost half an hour before Norman makes it onto the screen).

(in my opinion) There's just so much to say about this film I hardly know where to start.I first saw this movie about five years ago and wasn't impressed at all. Of course, I was about ten years old at the time. I didn't think that the famous shower scene was anything to frightening and the characters seemed a little boring. A little less than a year ago, I became very interested in the history of the film and not so much of the film itself. I read articles, reviews, anything that I could get my hands on. Then, Psycho was shown on AMC and I immediately thought that it was a masterpiece. Shame on me for not appreciating it sooner.The film as a whole is spectacular, but I like to break it down into little sections. First, I was very surprised and impressed with the actors that played Marion Crane and Norman Bates. Janet Leigh isn't given to much exposure to the film since she is killed off in about the middle of it. I thought that she did a good but not great job. On the other hand, Anthony Perkins blew me away. Both Norman and Anthony are very interesting. Norman's life that is set up and shown to us is so well depicted that I can't imagine anybody else playing the part. All of the characters including Arbogast, Lila, and Sam are so well created. Obviously, the plot is so unique and odd that you can't help but smile at it. A young woman on the run after stealing $40,000, and then accidentally falls into the wrong hands of a psychopath. It's great! The best thing is that nobody has ever done anything quite like it, and they won't be able to because then the magic will be gone. Even though the ever so famous shower scene is said to be one of the most chilling death scenes in history, I think that it may be a little overrated. I love it as much as the next person, but it's not all that scary. Who said it was supposed to be scary? Nobody, I know. But the majority of the Psycho audience gathers it to be very frightening. I do still think that it is one of the greatest and shocking scenes ever. The setting is very well set up as well. The Bates motel and house is so cleverly created that it brings a special atmosphere to the audience. It has something about it that you just can't forget.Finally, that music played throughout the film is one of the most spookiest sounds I have ever heard.

The first time I saw Psycho as a kid and seeing the shower scene it terrified me so much I actually became afraid to take a shower I had great fear of getting stabbed to death even in my own home. As any child would do myself included they grow away from the terror of scare scenes as age increases, but recently I have looked at the famous shower scene from a different perspective. Many are unaware but it took seven days to shoot the shower scene, seventy camera positions for the forty-five seconds of very famous footage not an actual bare breast or plunging knife is to be found in the final cut, just illusion through montage. Now I begin my discussion on montage for those who don't know it's meaning or importance. Montage is a distinct type of editing that brings more drama to film and it links shots of film together and the editing separates and makes a film different from other forms of art. Montage was developed from the Soviet Union. Montage was used in very distinct ways in Psycho mostly crafted from Russian editor and director Eisenstein whose editing technique clashing of images or more properly known as a graphic match in film. Actually both similar terms can be explained first clashing of images create conflict just as in the shower scene the images flashing quickly of the knife and Janet Leigh's body symbolize the action and drama of the film while tied to the music of the Psycho shower scene. The term graphic match is very symbolic to show that life goes down the drain. To explain in the shower scene as Janet Leigh is stabbed and her body slides down with the shower curtain breaking the camera does a very close angle shot of her eye and then the camera slowly but surely makes it way to the blood and water flowing down the drain to symbolize death. This is a great example of graphic match it does exactly what it says by taking two unlike objects as in this case an eye and a drain of a tub to compare the action and drama that just unfolded in a scene with blood and water going down the drain symbolizing death while the eye open and an open drain show that life is no more. Finally enough about the famous shower scene everyone should know by now the story and technique behind it and how it was done to perfection, but I end my discussion of the scene I don't what you to think that your in a cinema history class! Hey don't forget how great a film Psycho is it has several other good reasons for it's classic ranking besides the shower scene with montage to start the intelligent directing of Alfred Hitchcock he simply was the master at keeping people in suspense and Psycho is full of suspense from start to finish. Also another interesting moment is to notice Hitchcock as the pedestrian outside the office in the very first few minutes of Psycho it was common for Alfred to make small appearances in his movies. And Anthony Perkins was great as the best and most liked Psycho character of our time the famous Norman Bates. The character had such intelligent wit and yet evil twisted means. So make reservations to the Bates Motel you will enjoy this classic of strange happenings at a rundown motel. I added this movie to my video library just this year and I recommend that anyone add Psycho to a personal movie collection of their own.

If you don't go to the movies just for fun, answer me: what is the first name that comes to your mind when someone talks about suspense/mystery films? FRIDAY THE 13TH? No. SCREAM? No. Wes Craven? No. John Carpenter? No. Brian De Palma? No. Of course the answer would be \"Alfred Hitchcock\", if you really like cinema. Hitch is an unanimity today among film critics even more than 20 years after his death, something that never happened even with Kubrick and Bu\u00f1uel, for example. Not every film of his is a masterpiece, but at least one is an unquestionable classic, an icon when you think about suspense films: PSYCHO. It was released in 1960, shocking audiences and slowly becoming a classic. Considered by the American Film Institute the 18th best film ever and being one of the most well-known pictures of the American cinema, it was obviously ripped-off lots of times, even remade by Gus Van Sant in 1998 scene by scene. But, in opposite of what we would expect, it never became stale. It's still the same PSYCHO, an unique, chilling, spectacular work of art that entertains audiences and makes them think. A masterpiece!It's amazing how this film still remains unique 40 years after its release. Every generation enjoys it, every person who watches it for the first time has a strong opinion about it, it is always a good subject for talking. Some of the most remarkable moments of the cinema are on PSYCHO, at least one: a shower scene. But first let's get back to the beginning of the story. Marion Crane works as a secretary and her boss gives her a huge amount of money to deposit. Her boyfriend has to pay some debts and they want to live together without trouble. As the smart girl she is, Marion decides to run away with the money. She knows she is doing something wrong, so she changes her car and keep going on the road. On a rainy night, she realizes that is difficult to drive more and decides to stop at a motel she doesn't know: the decadent Bates Motel (\"12 cabins, 12 vacancies\"). There, Marion is received by a young man named Norman Bates, the motel owner, and checks in. He invites her to come to dinner, but Marion hears the voice of Norman's mother, who refuses to let the girl enter at her house. He takes to her a small dinner on his office and they talk a little. Norman lets to know that his mother is invalid and was involved in a tragedy on the past, and he works with dead birds. He seems to be an insecure person because of his mother attitudes. They finish to talk and Marion goes to her room in order to have a shower. That seems to be a calm place, uh? Well, Marion is taking shower and... you know what happens... Poor girl! Norman gets disturbed with the fact and hides Marion's car with her body (and the money) on the swamp. Some days later, Lila Crane, Marion's sister, and Sam Loomis, Marion's boyfriend, are searching for her. A private detective, named Arborgast, will appear to help them. The secret they will find out involving the insecure boy and his mean mother is something very, very weird.With an unusual story, Hitch made the one that is the best film of his brilliant career, along with VERTIGO. The story of PSYCHO could turn into a mess, but the screenplay is perfectly written, with all the ingredients to surprise and scare us. At the screen, what we see is even better. Not one disposable scene, great situations, involving characters. And Hitch... it is not even needed to say. Helped by a wonderful cinematography and Bernard Herrman's chilling, unforgettable score, his camera takes and the angles he uses are just brilliant! The two murder scenes are just perfect, especially the one in the shower, which I don't need to say that is one of the 3 most well-known scenes of the American cinema, and also one of the 3 best, scariest etc. Oh! And the actors! Who could think that Janet Leigh would be killed on the first half? And who could think Anthony Perkins was such a mad guy? The conclusion goes to the right way, being smart and haunting.I could write all my impressions about PSYCHO, but I don't want to take this much longer. It is one of the films that most influences the American cinema of our days. It is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. And that's it.\nTo finish, I just wanted to make a parallel between a scene in PSYCHO and a similar one in Brian De Palma's DRESSED TO KILL, obviously influenced by it. When they sum up the crime in PSYCHO, the police officer say that Marion Crane was kind of an alert for the mother to show up into Norman Bates-- the rigid mother who wanted her son only for her. In DRESSED TO KILL (you may think I'm a perverted), Kate Miller and Liz Blake were alerts for the psychiatrist's male side to show up. He wanted to change his sex, but they were obstacles to him because he got \"excited\" with them. I don't know why I'm writing that...

Though I was not around the 1st time the movie came out, I was lucky enough to recently catch a screening of it, with a guest appearance by Janet Leigh. I had already seen the movie twice, and anticipated everything that was about to happen, but it didn't really matter. It still scared me so much, I was petrified to think how terrified I would be if I saw it in the theaters in 1960, not knowing what was about to happen. We all know the plot--Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) embezzles 40,000 dollars from her company and is on the run. She stops at the Bates Motel where she meets Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), a friendly young man who is restrained from being close to anyone but his possessive mother. They talk, and she gets in the shower. Before she is done her shower, she is stabbed to death by Norman's mother. But who really stabbed her? And is she really dead? Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) and Marion's boyfriend (Jon Gavin) hire detective Arbogast (Martin Balsam) to investigate. Then he is similarly stabbed to death before he can question Norman's mother.... Psycho is simply amazing, one of the true artistic pieces of the cinema. Joseph Stefano's disturbing, sick screenplay will not soon be forgotten, though the plot is not the main part of the movie. The cinematography is some of the best ever put on the screen, from the several pans from the Bates Motel to Norman's house to the opening shot across the city. It is dark--undeniably bleak and dark, as is the mood of the movie. The art direction is necessarily scary--Norman's house is perfectly secluded from the rest of the world, and looks very spooky, as does the motel. As Balsam notes, the hotel seems to be \"hiding from the world.\" The acting varies--Balsam is quite good as the always suspicious detective, Leigh is ideally cast as the every day woman who sees a chance to get away from life and takes it, and Perkins is nothing less than fantastic as Norman Bates, a roll that would define his career, and one he will always be associated with. However, Miles and Gavin are wooden anti-characters with no personality whatsoever showing. But that really doesn't matter. Hitchcock liked the idea from the start--getting a big star and killing her off in the first reel. It certainly shocked audiences, who before came into movies whenever they wanted, sometimes even 30 minutes to an hour into the movie. They were not allowed to do that with Psycho. \"The film you should see from the beginning--or not at all\" the taglines stated. Psycho is a perfect example of audience manipulation--everyone assumes that the story is about Leigh, and when she gets bumped off, Hitchcock takes the audience down a completely different road. The shower scene is one of the most memorable and suprprising scenes in film history. The scenes in which Leigh is driving are suspenseful, even though there's nothing really happening. And when Perkins is trying to dispose of Leigh's car by pushing it into the swamp, the way the car stops sinking for a second--everyone suddenly wonders what he will do now--but then it sinks away again. Surprisingly enough, the audience wants the car to go down--we want Perkins to get rid of the evidence. And untrue to Horror formula, the climax of Psycho takes place not in a rainy dark night--but in the bright, sunny daylight. These are all examples of audience manipulation--which no one does better than Alfred Hitchcock. But yet--Hitchcock's direction, I think, is not the best part of the movie--or at least it is tied for first. The best? BERNARD HERRMANN. If you do not know that name yet, write it down. BERNARD HERRMANN. He has done the score to the Hitchcock movies Marnie, The Birds, The Wrong Man, North By Northwest, Vertigo (ohh, the Vertigo score), and Psycho. He also did the score to Scorcese's Taxi Driver, and Orson Welles' Citizen Kane. He won an oscar for his score for The Devil And Daniel Webster. His score for Psycho is certainly his most well known--especially the shower scene part. Though not his best (Vertigo is his best) the score is the part of Psycho that stays with you after the film is done, days after. That keeps haunting you, that keeps scaring you. Psycho would be three or four times less scary without the shrieking violins of Herrmann's score. Herrmann also pulled an exercise in audience manipulation--for the score, frightening as it is, consisted of only 4 violins. The music truly sets the mood for the movie. Creating the madness and worry in Marion's mind while she is driving, creating the true horror of the murders, and creating the calm but suspenseful serenity of some of the dialogues, where there is no music at all, and the film is eerily silent. You know the shrieking violins are soon. Bernard Herrmann's scores are not often enough credited as a huge, HUGE part Hitchcock's success with his pictures. So write that name down if you don't know it already: BERNARD HERRMANN. And see Psycho. If you've already seen it, see it again to catch the little things you missed before.

Apparently when it was made (1960) filmgoers were in the habit of wandering in & out of films at the theatre irrespective of the film's starting & finishing times. Trailers for \u0091Psycho' blazed the message: \"Make sure you watch this film from the beginning\". Those who heeded this advice could have been forgiven for wondering why: a young woman (Janet Leigh) steals a large sum of money from a business partner of her employer. On the road, she stops at the Bates Motel in order to divert attention from a suspicious cop, & with her boyfriend, her sister & a private detective also on her trail. The proprietor is one Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) who, although a little edgy, seems basically OK \u0096 apart from a slight maternal fixation. What's the big deal , they might ask \u0096 psychological drama, girl on the run etc. etc.: so far, so Hitchcock. After chatting with Bates for a while she retires to her room for a shower, which in hindsight was probably not such a good idea\u0085In an age when Hollywood was still largely dominated by the star system, half an hour into the movie Hitchcock takes his main lead - an attractive, curvaceous blonde - & kills her off, & with a savagery rarely portrayed on the big screen. He then takes what seemed like a fairly conventional movie & turns it on it's head. No longer is the lead character an attractive yet vulnerable young woman on the run, it is now a twitchy nervous antithesis of a Hollywood or even a Hitchcockian leading man (i.e. Cary Grant, James Stewart, Gregory Peck); no longer is the film a run-of-the-mill crime thriller, it is now a journey into the mind of a madman.I have heard that Hitchcock himself regarded this film as a comedy, & although I've never seen it this way myself I wonder if this is where for him the humour lies: the delight of taking accepted movie conventions, turning them upside-down & inside-out & yet still producing a hugely successful blockbuster by mangling all the rules. I'm sure it made him laugh anyway!Mention has to be made of Anthony Perkins' portrayal of Norman Bates - he is simply magnificent & puts in one of cinema's greatest performances. His representation of an unhinged madman masquerading as normal is brilliantly done & totally believable: his desperate attempts at normal behaviour & conversation are overlaid with a nervy touchiness; & his twitchy, constantly changing facial expressions make it clear before you know anything more about him that you're looking at a man torn with internal conflict. He delivers lines such as \u0091Mother isn't quite herself today' with a superb drollness that is somehow also loaded with hidden meaning, & in hindsight also quite funny. The end scene where we finally see Norman in his true colours done by anyone else would just look silly (i.e. the recent remake) but he makes it extremely chilling \u0096 for me one of cinema's great scenes.The directorial craftmanship is equally suberb: who else but Hitchcock could come up with anything like the famous shower scene? Shot over 7 days using 70 different camera set-ups for a minute or so of a naked girl being stabbed in a shower - & yet not once is there visible any of the girl's \u0091naughty bits' or of the knife plunging into her flesh, such was the attention to detail. In my opinion it probably still is the greatest cinematic sequence ever made.The scripting, the cinematography, the acting, the sets, but particularly it's subversive delight in turning conventionality on it's head to stunning effect make this film a masterpiece by any standards, a description that still applies 40 years later & I think will do for generations to come.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 5, "votes": 6}, "heading": "A touching tale of a young man & his mother", "date": "2000-05-02T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0071979", "sentiment score": [0.1099, 0.4101, 0.3844, 0.0882, 0.0073]}, {"content": "My mother always used to complain about this movie, it being the one suspense/horror film she actually went to.

From the point of the unknowing 90's viewer, this movie still holds up superbly, and becomes even more amazing if enough Hitchcock documentaries are watched. I find a couple of things are overlooked though. The greatest scene in my opinion is not the shower scene(although having the billed star die halfway through the film is incredible). It is the conversation between in the hotel room with the stuffed birds in the background. Subtle with so many distinct ironies and fantastic underplayed acting, mixed with the eerieness of that background creates maybe my second favorite scene in film(the first being the ending stairwell scene from Vertigo) Perhaps what creeped me out the most was the visual of that lonely forgotten house atop the hill, definitely embued with some unknown prescence that the audience cannot quite put their finger on. Like all stellar pieces of film or theater, there is a great deal of humor despite the premise of the work. The most amazing part of this film is its implication on cinema as a whole - the disturbing material inspired countless psychological thrillers and changed film forever. Although none will be able to match this movie for the sake of pure cinematic beauty, that's where the genius of Hitchcock comes into play.

More than anything why it's Hitchcock's triumph as a commercial filmmaker - past the shower scene and the camera tricks and the notorious finale - is that it's (not so) secretly a monument to what we hide in all of us.What I love about the movie seeing it again after so many years is seeing how in her own way Marion Crane is a bit of a psycho, just not quite at the level of 11 that Norman Bates is. There's an interesting parallel to make to how voice-over is used; Marion's imagination gets the better of her for a moment as she drives along and she makes up what the cop that pulls her over, her boss, her boyfriend, etc, all say. Watch as her face contorts into a little grin, almost against her better judgment, when she imagines the more twisted portion of the dialog.

After what is an amusing parody of exposition (the psychologist goes on for so long that it's the only logical explanation aside from dated, clunky writing - I prefer to think Hitchcock was smarter than that and was mocking what would or could be an exposition on Norman Bates + Mother and then just \"Mother\"), Norman/Mother is in his/her room, and the camera closes in as the voice-over gets intense, plotting, paranoid, not wanting to swat a fly.

It was a masterpiece then and remains a masterpiece today. Superior direction and camera work, and as one person commented, the film was released at a time when [psychological] monsters in the form of the \"boy next door,\" was not explored in films. Yes, Psycho started slow by today's standards, but the style back then was to move from the pleasant familiar to the darkest of horrors. Hitchcock understood how to create atmosphere and mood. His shower scene, while some today wonder what the hoopla is all about, set a standard of horror in an ordinary setting. How many films have copied this scene? I remember as a kid, fearing showers and hotels after seeing this flick. Hitchcock reportedly said that it was a good thing he didn't place Crane on the toilet (sic), or people would have a phobia about toilets.

His films defined horror for generations, especially with what many people are still calling the scariest movie of all time: \"Psycho.\" Over the years, the movie has been given much praise. It has had the honor to be placed in the American Film Institute's best 100 movies of all time list. The film has had the privilege to be re-created in 1998 by great director Gus Van Sant, who also added new actors and coloration to this classic tale. \"Psycho\" also has had the fortunate pleasure to have been followed up by several time-lapsing sequels, although not equal in quality, which continued the story and characters beyond the original film's restrictions. On top of all this, the movie has a unique story line, unusual characters, imagination-provoking motives, and manages to conduct its rare structure like no other film. \"Psycho\" is one of the better thrillers of our time. \tFirst lets take a look at the unique but perfectly organized structure of this classic horror tale. It beholds what I call a false first act. The first act opens by introducing a character named Marion Crane, sister of Lila Crane, who steals $40, 000 from her employer one day and is in the process of leaving town when her situation is complicated even more. Marion is pulled over by a mysterious police man, who checks out the circumstances, and then allows her to continue on with her journey. He then follows her many miles to a car dealer, where Marion cleverly trades her current car in for a used junkie to camouflage herself from peering foes. Marion then continues to drive along the busy highway until a shielding rainstorm persuades her to stop to rest at The Bates Motel. (spoilers ahead) Then she meets the owner, Norman Bates, who explains to her that his mother is a lunatic. Marion then goes to her cabin where she is stabbed to death in the shower by an unknown predator who looks like an old woman.\n\tExtraordinary, a simply flawless false first act. The movie introduces a character, a problem, and complicates it for the character involved. Then the conclusion (the murder of Marion) solves the first initial problem, throwing us off balance. While we recover, the filmmakers open a brand new series of events, this time detailing the missing Marion Crane. A detective, Milton Arbogast, who tries to investigate Norman's mother, is also killed in the process of doing so. Lila's investigation of her own evolves the second act problems, all winding towards the same awe-inspiring denouement, which I will not have the audacity to reveal to you. \tNow for some nice pointers for \"Psycho\": The opening scene develops Marion Crane's romantic characteristics as well as her personal morals. The scene in which Marion decides to commit theft is never explained to us through dialogue like many lesser films would do, but through Marion's complex stares at the cash and her reactions to it. The police officer's behavior is a whole plot in itself, and since the character's point of view is so focused, we know nothing more about this suspicious man than Crane herself. The Atmosphere of the Bates Motel is one of the creepiest moods I have ever experienced in the movies. Not to mention the famous shower scene, certainly the most shocking and grisly slasher moment of all time. The investigation of Marion's disappearance has a specific odyssey to it--intriguing and unsatisfying. All these minor elements contribute to making \"Psycho\" the most talked about films ever. \tThere is a small, but quite noticeable, opinion flaw in the last ten minutes of \"Psycho,\" however. It is the scene where the detective explains the disturbing behavior of Norman Bates to the film's remaining characters, but also to the audience. This scene has never been necessary. The picture would have ended with much more controversy and fantasy if the writers would have left the strangeness of Norman to the imagination rather than explaining elements to us, not to mention the fact that all answers are revealed in the many sequels. I think it would have been interesting to see what happened if Gus Van Sant would have left that sequence out of his re-make, after all, he added a lustful masturbation scene, so why couldn't he have taken out some unneeded material as well. Oh well, I guess, until another actor attempts to master the terror found in the eyes of Anthony Perkins, we'll just have to juggle around these ideas in our minds of how this near-perfect movie could have been better.

Could you possibly imagine anyone other than Nicholson in the role of Randall P. McMurphy in \"One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest\" or Dennis Hopper as Billy in \"Easy Rider\"? Keep in mind the introverted, insecure Mama's Boy was not really PSYCHOpathic as Hannibal The Cannibal was in \"Silence of the Lambs\" - a cold-blooded killer with no conscience - but rather criminally insane, plagued by schizophrenic delusions and seriously in need of multiple reality-checks. Anthony Hopkins did a wonderful job as the vicious Hannibal, and also as Corky, the schizo-killer ventriloquist in \"Magic\".

Well, Hitch did and even told the moviegoers at the time to show up for the beginning of the film or else miss the wonderful Janet Leigh.Psycho has it all. A great story, well two as a matter of fact. One of the greatest scores by Bernard Herrmann (how many people don't know the skreetching violin and deep tuba sounds that really make the shower scene a classic?).

Vera Miles makes the role of Crane's sister, honestly real and more than just a plot device.This film succeeds in all aspects, including the ending which is often said to be overlong and unecessary. Without hearing the inner thoughts of Bates, however, would leave a gaping hole in the production. The double image of Bates face with his mother's scull remains chilling, even in today's glorified, Natural Born Killers-like ultraviolence.

So many taboos of the era were abolished by this film - violence, brief nudity, transvestism, and (gasp!) a flushing toilet. While all of this has lost its shock value by today's standards, the overall grasp this film has on the viewer will never be outdated. Considered by many to be Alfred Hitchcock's greatest work, this is undoubtedly one of the highlights of film history.The story begins in Phoenix, Arizona, with a woman named Marian Crane (Janet Leigh) and her lover, Sam Loomis (John Gavin), in a hotel room enjoying an afternoon tryst. They are in love, but the problem is that Sam is married and can't afford to get a divorce. No problem, actually. Marian happens to work at a bank. So, later, she steals a bundle of cash ($40,000) and heads off to Los Angeles where Sam lives. During her road trip, this blonde beauty tires and checks into the Bates Motel. There, she meets the odd, bird-like hotel proprietor, Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). She converses with Norman in his scary, bird-filled parlor and soon comes to realize the strange relationship he shares with his mother. Soon, out of left-field, Marian is slashed-off in what is probably one of the most famous scenes in movie history - the wet and bloody shower scene. This was certainly a film first - the demise of the main character halfway through the picture (it was actually an experiment by Hitchcock to gauge audience reaction). Now what? Well, an investigator (Martin Balsam), Sam, and Marian's sister Lila (Vera Miles), all converge on this house of horrors to investigate the mysterious disappearance of Marian. What will happen? Who will survive? It's all too suspenseful and fun.The acting is on a tremendous level and Hitchcock's direction, as always, is just awesome. Plus, it is impossible not to love the violin-drenched soundtrack by composer-extraordinarre, Bernard Herrmann. \"Psycho\" is a historical event. Not only because of the top-notch production itself, but because of the facts behind the film. For instance, did you know that the infamous shower scene that only lasts 45 seconds, took Hitchcock one week to film to his satisfaction? It's interesting to note, too, that actress Miles was chosen for the role of Lila as a consolation prize of sorts. See, Hitchcock had cast her as the lead in 1958's \"Vertigo\", but she became pregnant just before production. Therefore, Kim Novak got the dual role. But Hitchcock didn't forget about the lovely Miles, giving her a role in one of the most famous movies ever. Also, \"Psycho\" was a work of secrecy and surprise. Hitchcock bought the original novel by Bloch, from Bloch, for $9,000, anonymously. Then he bought as many copies of the book that he could find, just to keep the end a secret. Then, when \"Psycho\" was released in theatres, Hitchcock had strict instructions with the theatre owners not to let anyone in the film late, since Leigh's role was so short and she was billed as the \"star\". This is a terrific film in every aspect. No wonder \"Psycho\" was listed by the American Film Institute, in 1998, as one of the 100 Greatest American Films.Hitchcock cameo: He is the man in the cowboy hat standing on the sidewalk outside Marian's office.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "....ultimate Hitchcockian masterpiece....", "date": "1999-08-25T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0072183", "sentiment score": [0.0084, 0.0279, 0.0554, 0.4141, 0.4942]}, {"content": "I hate that I knew about the shower scene before I ever saw the movie.

Some old horror films like Rosemary's Baby are excellent, but this is not. As for Bernard Herrmann score, it's overplayed, can't he think of anything new to compose?

(Hitch may have went the route of director Michael Powell who became an outcast once his technicolor murder flick PEEPING TOM was seen.)2)The featured star disappears a third of the way through igniting a new method of scriptwriting and casting.

This is so true in the case of Anthony Perkins, not exactly a Cary Grant, who creates a stunningly chaotic portrayal of an abused son/mental madman. (Hitch shoots him from tilted angles and shadowy atmospheres to project Norman Bates' unquestionably distorted state of mind, not to mention his evil grin.)4) The shower scene, of course. Never before in any film of any kind known to man had people seen such frightening butchery and frank brutality. (Hitch storyboarded each of the 80+ cuts that take place within the 2 minute segment.)5) Norman Bates' mother, who sits upstairs in the \"old house on the hill\" and just watches what transpires when she's not taking part in it. (Hitch makes her a mystery until the very end when she is finally revealed to us and to Vera Miles in a masterfully shot turn of a chair.)6)The set-up and payoff which consists of 40,000 dollars, a device common in most thrillers but new to this kind of psychological terror. (Hitch makes the viewer think the 40 grand will be the staple of importance and plot when it really disappears amidst the horror and has no significance at all.)7)Finally, composer Bernard Hermann's famed musical score is a pulsating, vibrant piece of gothic composition that matches the story and character actions perfectly. (Hitch and Hermann worked on several films together, none better than this.)Is there any other question that PSYCHO is one of the top 7 or 8 films of all time? I don't think so. Just look how film history began a slow course towards more independence and honesty after PSYCHO scared everyone into believing this kind of film could be made.RATING: 10+", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 94, "votes": 138}, "heading": "A Perfect Film.", "date": "1999-06-28T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0072163", "sentiment score": [0.0099, 0.0259, 0.066, 0.4186, 0.4796]}, {"content": "This movie freaked me out!

Alfred Hitchcock is, for his time, king of the world, with a string of hit movies, a hit TV show, and even growing critical respect (from \"auteur\" critics like Andrew Sarris and Francois Truffaut). Flush with all of this success, did Hitchcock continue making the glossy entertainments he excelled at in the 1950's? No. Instead, he made a low-budget film which was obviously influenced by B-movies (notably the ones made by William Castle) and what he had learned on TV. The result was PSYCHO, and it's safe to say movies were never the same again.Many articles have been written claiming Spielberg and Lucas have been responsible for the decline of movies today, and have been responsible for more cheap rip-offs than anyone else. It seems to me Hitchcock and PSYCHO have inspired (if that's the right word) more rip-offs than Spielberg or Lucas put together. Not just the obvious ways, like the many horror films which pay homage to it (DRESSED TO KILL, HALLOWEEN), or the films which have spoofed it(HIGH ANXIETY). There's also its influence in narrative(speeding things up, instead of taking time to tell the story), its reliance on fairly thin characters, sparse dialogue, and of course, that music. Someone more qualified than I could go at length at how Hitchcock's technique here has echoed throughout moviemaking today, but that influence to is undeniable. I guess to sum up, PSYCHO does what Spielberg, Lucas, and every blockbuster film have been accused of doing; making a B-movie on the scale of an A-movie(of course, Hitchcock had a lower budget, but he did have stars like Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, and well-known actors like John Gavin, Martin Balsam, and Vera Miles).As the rip-offs shouldn't put you off the Spielberg and Lucas films, nor should the rip-offs put you off of PSYCHO(I haven't seen the remake yet, but I still want to). No matter how many times you've seen it before, the shower scene still packs a wallop. So does the climax in the basement, and the final shot of Norman. Perkins avoids the mistake most movie psychos (pardon the expression) make today by hamming it up; although you suspect something, you're prepared to dismiss him until you find out the truth.

Undoubtedly, Psycho is the greatest horror film ever made, bar-none. The story is incredible. The acting is near perfection. The cinematography is godly. The soundtrack is perfect. It's hard to find anything wrong with Psycho. Perhaps the only imperfection I can find with Psycho is the inability to stand the test of time. One of the reasons the shower scene has become so notorious is that it's not only filmed to perfection, but because the elements of sexuality and murder are so surreal. In 1960, seeing a nude women being murdered in a shower was something that no-one had experienced yet, and was quite shocking. Nowadays, seeing Jason double-spearing two lovers having sex is nothing uncommon. I envy those who experienced Psycho in 1960 in the theaters .. those experienced the full terror of Psycho.Aside from this though, the movie is flawless. I won't even go into to how incredible the cinematography is. One thing I think people seem to forget about the movie is the incredible soundtrack. Sound is such an important element in movies and Psycho is undaunted when it comes to sound.

Like any genuine work of true genius, it may be enjoyed on more than one level. Alfred Hitchcock forced film-goers to confront head-on just a few of the shadowy corners of the human psyche: the Oedipus/Elektra complexes, jealousy about sexual perceived sexual] rights, guilt, and self-hatred [as in Norman's cross-dresssing], to cite just a few examples of neurotic behavior. Perhaps the most frightening interpretation of the film is that one is responsible for one's actions and cannot, ever, alter the designated course a particular act has set in motion. Here, it is Marion Crane's decision to steal the $40 grand from her employer in order to race to Fairvale to be with her [illicit] lover, Sam Loomis. The opening vista, a bleak mountain and desert landscape over Phoenix [note the metaphor for both the geographical location and the town's name], is replete with the futility of the lovers ever forging a permanent bond with one another. The film is a terrific essay of human desperation and its stray threads: the hunger for sex, for a safe haven, for an ascendant place in one's tiny universe. The barrenness of the emotional landscape is shiveringly mirrored in Bernard Herrmann's shrill, spiky score, which speaks of the desolation of all humankind. Both murders are violent acts of mutilation and hatred, one thinks, not only for the victims, but also for the perpetrator. Fittingly, the killer's \"cleansing\" ritual takes place in a swamp, the normal repository for all kinds of secrets and unclean, dangerous organisms lurking beneath the stagnant surface. Finally, I found most interesting the title on the record label on the turntable in Norman's room: Beethoven's Eroica Symphony [No. 3]. This majestic, noble work bears no resemblance to the music one would justly associate with the tormented mind of young Bates. One can only guess that the boy's impressionable mind was at one time quite normal and receptive to elevated experiences such as a hearing of this great work of Beethoven's, but that jealousy, perhaps having been spurred by an intimacy with his mother, drove the boy to madness. Guilt, one of the human being's great purgatives, finds no outlet here, as we see in Norman's feral smile at the film's end.

It grabbed your attention at the very first and then something else happened, and then something else, and things kept piling on until you had no clue how the ending was going to turn out. This is the kind of movie you think about for hours after you see it because there's so much to it! And then of course the marvelous ending. I won't say it here in case if you haven't seen it, luckily when I saw it I didn't even know the ending.

The dialogue, the camera work, the suspense, the music! Everything! Just seeing how disturbed Norman Bates is, is a very creepy thing. Hitchcock filmed this without one imperfection. He used a lot of mirrors in Psycho, and I personally think the scariest scene in the entire movie is where Marion's sister goes up to \"Mrs. Bates\" room, and she thinks she sees someone behind her, and turns around, but its just herself in the mirror. Another very interesting thing about Psycho was all the bird references. Marion's last name is \"Crane\" Norman even says to her \"You eat like a bird\" and Norman's office is filled with stuffed birds. Psycho's shower scene is by far the most suspenseful moment in the history of film. I think so anyway! To finish this up, I'd just like to say that Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is a classic, and no one should be remaking it!!! !!", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 5, "votes": 5}, "heading": "Greatest horror movie of all time!", "date": "1998-08-11T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0072049", "sentiment score": [0.0248, 0.0357, 0.0517, 0.2694, 0.6184]}, {"content": "I've heard so much about this film before I watch it.
