They both after (Gian Maria Volont\u00e9) Indio, a criminal and bank robber for his bounty. They decide to join forces againt Indio and his gang.The character of Eindo embodies the thirst for blood, treachery, envy, cunning, stealing and vanity, which are characteristics that represent the evil in human nature.At the beginning of the film, it seems to us that Colonel Mortimer and Monko are after Indio for money, only because they are both bounty hunters, but the events of the film prove the opposite.Indio's motives for murder and theft are still unknown, which makes him the most mysterious and complex character in the movie. Despite this, the actor succeeded in playing this difficult role, embodying the various emotions and psychological ills of the character.In contrast to the Joker, the evil man, who, despite this, enjoys wide sympathy from the public, the character of Indio remains an outcast who represents evil in its worst form.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "For a Few Dollars More", "date": "2023-05-12T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9050329"}, {"content": "Sergio Leone returns a year later with yet another western epic, again starring Clint Eastwood as the titular \"man with no name\" character, and again utilizing lots of actors from the first film.Is it quite as good as Fistfull of Dollars?

Stacked up against Sergio Leone's other westerns, I think For a Few Dollars More is a notable improvement on the already solid Fistful of Dollars (which I might also need to revisit soon), but a little behind his others when it comes to quality. Somehow, he got even better as a filmmaker in the six years after this film, releasing The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly (one of the best movies of all time), Once Upon a Time in the West (another of the best movies of all time), and Duck, You Sucker (possibly the most underrated western of all time) between 1966 and 1971.It's fun to see Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood team up in this one, with a fairly straightforward but compelling storyline that involves them each tracking down the same criminal. The main villain isn't particularly deep, but he is very easy to root against... maybe he's a \"like to hate\" villain rather than a \"love to hate\" one, because he doesn't quite match the intensity or truly believable menace of say Henry Fonda's character in Once Upon a Time in the West (to be fair, who does?)Like any movie with Ennio Morricone doing the music, the film's made much better thanks to him. The score is fantastic, and when the film uses the score to help tell its story, it's just wonderful. This is something you get even more in later collaborations with Morricone and Leone, but it's still on full display here, and to a greater extent than it was in Fistful of Dollars.For a Few Dollars More is a great western, and there might only be a handful of American westerns I'd say are better. Italians did this genre better than the Americans, and Leone in particular was the best of the best, as a director. This is great stuff, and the highs here make it easy to overlook a slightly bloated runtime and a few scenes that feel like they could be tightened up just a little (pacing is something that's perfected in Leone's subsequent films).", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "A very satisfying western", "date": "2023-04-18T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9002538"}, {"content": "I like this one better than a Fistful of Dollars, and it only got better from here with the trilogy.

However, the Dollars trilogy's overlooked film, \"For a few Dollars More\" is , in my opinion, as good as \"The good, the bad and the Ugly\", in addition to being my favorite of the trilogy. As opposed to the previous film, the stoty here is a bit deeper, with a certain mystery that only becomes solved at the last scene. In addition to Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef enters the cast as Colonel Douglas Mortimer, a former soldier-turned bounty hunter. Van Cleef\u00b4s acting, especially in the duel, is perfect, because of how he is mad, sad, excited, ready and badass all rolled into one. Gian Maria Volonte, playing a different mexican bad guy than from \"Fistful\", is great as El Indio, if not a bit theatrical (he was a stage actor). And who could forget Josef Egger as the old prophet. The scope has also increased tremendously from \"Fistful\". They visit at least 5 towns, mutliple jails, a train, sallons, and, of course, the beautiful Almeria desert. The soundtrack for this film is also beautiful, and the diuels are all accompanied by fantastic scores. The film is, in my opinion, the funniest spaghetti western (aside from the comedies, of course). The humor is more subtle as opposed to jokes, with countless memorable ones (the hotel owners, the old prophet, the not-so-politically-correct hotel worker, the \"robbery\" at Santa Cruz, the old prophet and many more). This movie pioneered Sergio Leone\u00b4s style and takes it\u00b4s time with telling the story, something that i appreciate. The dialogue and scrips has definetly improved since \"Fistful\", thanks to Segio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni. There\u00b4s countless things i could say about this film, but I think it\u00b4s time to wrap it up.This film is my personal favorite of the Dollars trilogy, which says a lot.

This was as close to comedy as Leone ever got.All three films have great music scores, although I am partial to \"More\"s over the others.With the Dollars Trilogy, Sergio Leone created a new style of western, set in a nihilistic and violent world where speed and accuracy with a gun means everything, and love and compassion rarely exist. This style further evolved with Sam Peckinpah (The Wild Bunch) who amped up the violence, but also brought the heart back.Leone went on to refine the Dollars Trilogy and create his best film - Once Upon A Time In The West - but the Dollars Trilogy (and in particular For A Few Dollars More) is still entertaining today largely thanks to the highly stylised shootouts.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "More Is Best", "date": "2022-08-24T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8482518"}, {"content": "Another Eastwood classic, with the show partially stolen by Van Cleef. Part of my western movie journey. Sergio Leone does it again and delivers a fantastic western. Compared to my first foray into the spaghettis westerns from Leone: A fistful of dollars. This entry, part of the so called dollar trilogy is nearly as good. It really hones in on the good guy bad guy dynamic and nothing else besides that exists. Fistful just had a few more characters in general with I think elevated it.Directorially this felt weaker than fistful, that still means it's incredible, but it felt a little less interesting. The editing is great at times and I love the creative inputs. That said the editing is also rough and caused the story at times hard to follow with no clear passage of time. Causing me to have to ''recalibrate'' and think ''oh that just happened''.Music here is once again iconic. I felt like there's was a little less of it used here, whereas in fistful it was used literally at any time they could. But in Few Dollars More we get the iconic soundtrack, the one that's deeply rooted as *the* western song. The music from the pocket watch is enchanting as well, and mixed so well.Characters are great, actors without a doubt just as good. Eastwood never slips, Van Cleef is incredible and probably my favorite Volont\u00e8 owns his villainous role ones again with a complexity and depth we've come to love I guess. It was a little jarring because at first I though it was the same character as Fistful, as if this movie was a sequel. Obviously not but still.Negatives here are just some sloppy editing here and there and the sound quality and sound effects sound significantly worse. Some sounds being chopped off awkwardly and Music peaking a lot. This was the remastered version I watched. No negatives for annoying actors or anything. And I guess another negative, but this goes for I think the trilogy, is the lack of bullet holes in people's shirts and such.Great follow up and can't wait for TGTBATG.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "For a Few Dollars More", "date": "2022-08-23T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8480965"}, {"content": "This has all the gritty stylish realization as a Fistful of Dollars but none of its novelty.

And just like that we're launched into the narrative. To watch even one of Sergio Leone's \"spaghetti westerns\" is all that is required to fully understand what a masterful filmmaker the man was; to watch two or more is, as a viewer pure bliss. We can anticipate the same marvelously high quality from all his pictures, in every regard, and the only question is of which aspects are most readily fetching from one title to the next. In varying proportions we're invariably treated to splendid costume design, and hair and makeup work; lush, vivid cinematography; beautiful landscapes, and fantastic set design; rich, timeless music that lends tremendously to each passing scene; pristine effects; outstanding direction; reliably powerful, dexterous acting; and more. Sure enough, 'For a few dollars more' gives us all this, in spades - and is without a doubt an essential must-see not just among its genre brethren, but also in the world of cinema at large.What's striking are those subtle ways in which this and Leone's other two related features differ. 'A fistful of dollars,' 'For a few dollars more,' and 'The good, the bad, and the ugly' are all roundly excellent. Yet where the 1964 picture is direct, straightforward, and visceral and thrilling, the 1966 film is more emotionally wrought as it lets each beat expand and breathe on its own. 'For a few dollars more' finds a cozy balance somewhere between those bookends: artistically mindful, but less readily grandiose; violent and exciting, but not as outright nasty in that invigoration. Moreover, there's sharp intelligence here - wry humor, and a tinge more depth and complexity in the narrative writing - that fits neatly between the action-oriented romp of its predecessor and the soaring epic of its successor. None of this is to say that any part of the unofficial trilogy is lacking, only that between the three, in totality they represent genuine perfection of storytelling and film-making.Though Morricone's contributions here aren't as widely recognizable as what he has put forth elsewhere, his compositions are just as smart. If anything they broadly carry a darker tone that stands apart from much of his oeuvre that readily comes to mind. The sound effects, added in post-production, are no different from what has been used in this picture's cousins, but it seems to me as though they're employed to an extent that notably a tad indulgent. The performances are perhaps less entirely grabbing than in this title's sister films, but everyone involved definitely impresses all the same as they bring the story to life. Among them all, here it's Gian Maria Volont\u00e9 who especially stands out, lending an intensity to a villain so vicious as Indio who nevertheless is shown to have his own complications. And while 'For a few dollars more' comes across as marginally less action-heavy, or absorbing from a narrative standpoint, when it does completely draw us in - not least of all at the climax - the result is greatly rewarding.To whatever degree one could claim one movie in Leone's \"Man With No Name\" \"trilogy\" to be better than another, it's a matter of fractions, and not whole numbers. Of them I would say this may be the weakest - but I say that only with the caveat that such comparison is all but meaningless given the incredibly tall standards Leone and his collaborators were operating on. Down to every last detail - writing, direction, acting, work behind the scenes - there's such fabulous value in this picture as to certainly mark it as one of the greatest westerns ever made, and surely among the best movies generally. Even for those who don't tend to spend much time with westerns (and I'm one of them), 'For a few dollars more' is a terrific, entertaining, wonderfully satisfying film that will continue to stand tall for years to come.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Fantastic, essential western classic", "date": "2022-08-04T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8398356"}, {"content": "Great movie I enjoy watching the movie, the story was amazing but there is some exaggeration, the acting was excellent, and the main characters in the movie were great, I recommend you to watch the movie.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 2}, "heading": "For a Few Dollars More", "date": "2022-08-03T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8396794"}, {"content": "This is one of my favorites.Let's face it, hella brutal, so not often a great date night pickIt's funny in places you might not expect especially in a Clint Eastwood-Lee Van Cleef buddy flick, like Martin and LewisOK, example: the hotel operator and his woman, not sure their relationship, they're talking to Clint at the front desk then long story short the hotel man walks out from behind the desk and he's like 4 feet tall and the woman is like 6 feet tall.The detailed sets, the talking heads, the wide open range in ItalyAnd that brings up a point, the \"outside\" looks different from the \"inside\", as if with a completely different set of equipment and possibly even operatorsThen there's that flute sound every now and then, what the heck?If you're like me and you prefer \"This week in baseball\" to baseball, try searching for a video titledFor A Few Dollars More - \"The Old Prophet\"Clint seems like he's having trouble keeping a straight faceIt's in the movie at about call it 48:30It's like a highlight There's your spoilerI could watch it any time, picking up wherever, and I would still enjoy it for however longI used to watch \"Bladerunner\" all the time and never tired of itIf you don't watch at least once, you are erring.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 3}, "heading": "Feast your eyes", "date": "2022-07-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8311691"}, {"content": "Most would probably say The Good,the bad and the ugly was the best, but my personal favorite is this entry.

An explosive combination which culminates into a triumphant, epic, iconic Spaghetti Western. It's an amazing achievement which fueled my passion for cinema even more. It wasn't well-received back then, but now it is appreciated for what it is: simply a tremendous movie.In fact this movie got it all right: intriguing characters, great scenery, a splendid score, flawless direction as well as exciting editing and a thrilling plot.Firstly, the movie starts effectively with three brilliant character introductions in form of epic entrances.Van Cleef has the honor of being the first one introduced: the determined, cool and perfect shootist Bounty Hunter. Charles Bronson nearly got the role, but I think van Cleef was the perfect choice. It was nice that he finally got to more recognized after he had played minor roles in others Westerns, including the fantastic \"High Noon\"(1952) as well as the wonderful \"The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance\"(1962).Then it is the legendary Man with No Name played by the even more legendary Clint Eastwood whose introduced in a memorable and striking scene. The level of badassness is unattainable.Finally, Volont\u00e9's Indio is sneakily helped to escape out of prison only to reveal himself as a sadistic, baby-killing maniac with a troubled past. The church scene is quite memorable in it's intensity.The movie only gets better when Manco and Mortimer team-up to pursue Indio together.My only problem with the film, to be honest, is the fact that it was slightly convoluted during the end of the third act. But this minor flaw is quickly dwarfed by the epic and surprisingly personal shoot-out that ensues.Eastwood is right when he underlines that Leone is \"great with faces\". This is continuously proven throughout the movie. Leones direction, which was considered radical back in the 1960s, is stylish and vividly unique as always. It's superb filmmaking, essentiallyThe music, while in my opinion the weakest of the Trilogy is exciting in its experimental, mood-conveying uniqueness. It gave me goosepumbs on several occasions, which is always a good sign.Additionally, I think the sound effects should not be forgotten as they're indispensable to the Western experience.Moreover, the cinematography, in a engrossing wide-aspect ratio, offering a picturesque (spanish) scenery is greatly appreciated. The framing is glorious.Furthermore the movie has a lot of memorable lines, like the following: \"Alive or dead?

Writing very quickly, Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni banged out a new script and headed off into production. What they produced was much more naturally in line with Leone's style, creating a more cohesive overall film that has a more appropriate amount of plotting to fit.It is the story of two bounty hunters, Clint Eastwood's Manco and Lee Van Cleef's Colonel Mortimer, in pursuit of a noted criminal, newly escaped from prison, El Indio (Gian Volonte). And, that's kind of it. There is a plan around it that has some twists and turns, but it's a simple and bare story that takes a little over two hours to play out as opposed to the relatively overstuffed 90-minutes of the Leone's previous film.Much like A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More is also a movie of great moments, but the simplified story allows the movement from one moment to the next to feel more natural and more of a whole. We're not getting a molehill of exposition to explain the conflict between the three main characters because it's overall a very easy to understand story underneath. Leone's films aren't exactly narrative freight trains, moving with utmost speed and efficiency from one plot point to another. They like to luxuriate in details, building up these great moments and letting them play out fully. They're really not the sort of thing I expect to see praised as some of the greatest films ever made because pacing is so important to so many people, and these movies move really slowly.Each of the three characters are introduced alone. Mortimer shows up in a town, grabs a handbill that details the $1,000 reward for a local outlaw, and proceeds to shoot him down in the street with a unique extra shoulder rest for his pistol. Manco shows up in another small town looking for a man wanted for $2,000 and proceeds to dispatch him as well as three of his men, hiding his gun wielding hand underneath his poncho for most of the action (including a tense little game of five card draw with the target, played one handed by Manco). El Indio breaks out of prison when his gang show up, killing all of the guards, and El Indio murders his cellmate, taking a small model of a liquor cabinet with him that the carpenter fellow prisoner had been making. All three end up going towards El Paso, home of the most stringently guarded bank in the area.Manco and Mortimer realize each other's presence and, after an amusing getting to know each other scene where they shoot their hats around in the middle of the night, they decide to team up with Manco working to get inside El Indio's gang with Mortimer (who insulted the hunchback played by Klaus Kinski and would be known) staying outside. One moment that really highlights the step in the right direction that this movie is compared to the previous film is how Manco rescues an errant member of the gang in prison in order to gain El Indio's trust. It just happens quickly and wordlessly. He finds out what he needs to do, he shows up placing a few sticks of dynamite just inside the cell's window, and then has a horse outside for the man to jump onto as soon as he's free. It's done in a few minutes with a bit of humor and a good amount of style.The overall objective is to whittle down El Indio's gang, taking the $10,000 bounty for him as well as the cumulative bounties for other members of the gang. So, when El Indio gives Manco the objective of going with three other members to a nearby town to rob that bank, Manco simply kills the three and then forces the telegraph operator to report a robbery that never happened. This triggers the robbery by El Indio, but El Indio hadn't shared his whole plan, managing to get away with the hidden safe from the bank while Manco and Mortimer wait on the wrong side of the town.Manco returns to the gang with a tale of being overwhelmed by the authorities (helped by a flesh wound Mortimer gives him to the next with a well-placed bullet), and the gang strikes out east to a remote little town to try and open the safe and wait for the heat to blow over. Mortimer joins them with the ability to open the safe without explosives, and we're set for the final showdown.Now, there's one element of this film that I don't think really connects, and it's the one emotional element. Mortimer's sister was murdered by El Indio some years ago, and the two share a pair of gold watches that each play the same tune, a matching set that Mortimer and his sister had held together. This ended up reminding me of Leone's similar effort at emotional payoff in Once Upon a Time in the West, that time around the character Harmonica. The information, in both cases, gets revealed late, really late, in the film, and it kind of dulls the seemingly intended impact of it all. It makes sense, but suddenly trying to gain some pathos in a film that's all about stylish gunplay pretty much from beginning to end doesn't really work all that well.Still, that stylishness is infectious. Combined with the more appropriately built story to match, For A Few Dollars More represents Leone really growing as a filmmaker, finding the groove of the kinds of stories he wanted to make and how he wanted to make them. It's an entertaining romp through the Old West as seen by an Italian in Spain, and it's a good old fashioned time at the movies.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 3}, "heading": "Growth", "date": "2021-11-01T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7500999"}, {"content": "I don't like westerns but saw this one and was never bored which i usually do get bored in westerns but from start to end the action sense are tense.and it is pretty funny the it has a really good story and i will watch more westerns if they are like this.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 4}, "heading": "A great movie even though I don't like westerns", "date": "2021-10-05T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7411457"}, {"content": "For a Few Dollars More (1965) is a movie in my DVD collection and is also available on Amazon Prime.

Their paths eventually have to cross and they decide it is best to play off each others strengths so they can both achieve their mutually desired outcome.

It is so hard to say which film is better, this or the first film. Lee Van Cleef is an absolutely awesome addition to this film but Eastwood was slightly cooler in the first film. The lines, dialogue and delivery in this film are excellent. There's great chemistry between characters in this picture. The shootouts, props and action sequences are awesome as you'd expect from a Leone film. The soundtrack is also remarkable. This is a near perfect picture with great depth and a fun ending.

I remember when I watched the film for the first time, I laughed out loud and started clapping multiple times since this film has so many undeniably awesome moments! I don't know why this movie doesn't get the deserved attention from so many people. The problem might very well be that this film stands in the shadow of its iconic follow-up 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly' (1966)!Having said that, 'For a Few Dollars More' absolutely needs to be talked about much more often!\nThis motion picture has a great script and a great story overall. Sergio Leone's execution of this film is also astounding!\nI don't know how you execute this story so well, but somehow Leone did it!With a runtime of 132 minutes, this picture could have totally felt overly long and dragged out, but thanks to the fantastic editing and pacing of the film as well as the genius storytelling, it never gets boring whatsoever!Here we have Clint Eastwood, whose work (including his Western work) I am very familiar with, Lee Van Cleef and Gian Maria Volont\u00e8 who I need to watch more movies of.\nClint Eastwood loves that cigar in his mouth, it's iconic and I love it! It never gets tired seeing him with a cigar during a close-up! He has completely mastered the look of a Western hero! His costume as well as his entire look are just pure greatness!\nLee Van Cleef plays this older bounty hunter with a lot of experience and also a fair amount of knowledge. Him and Eastwood have this super cool back and forth with each other!\nGian Maria Volont\u00e8 plays the villain El Indio who has an awesome theme music and a great backstory tying all the different dots and characters together. It all makes sense at the end of the day!Speaking of El Indio's theme, ENNIO MORRICONE, the genius, the mastermind composer, did an extraordinary job with the soundtrack! All of these songs are beautiful to listen to and have so much meaning that they actually elevate the story further, in a way musical pieces rarely ever do (unless they're in a musical)! The Leone-Morricone duo is iconic and unbeatable! My favorite piece is listening to the BEAUTIFUL chimes!Overall, 'For a Few Dollars More' is one of my favorite and one of the best movies of all time!

The final 10 minutes of this film might be the best final 10 minutes I have ever seen in any film, especially when you watch the film for the first time due to the surprise factor!\nI will forever be grateful to Ennio Morricone as well as Sergio Leone for their undeniably great contributions to the world of movies! 9/10", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 8}, "heading": "\"Bravo!\"", "date": "2020-10-04T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6147282"}, {"content": "He matches Clint trigger-pull for trigger-pull and sneer for sneer.

I loved those spaghetti westerns from Sergio Leone when they came out and I still love them now. For A Few Dollars More is certainly one of the best ones, and even fifty-five years later it still rocks. Sergio Leone knows how to make villains likable, he knows how to make a story suspenseful with not a lot of words. The close-ups from the characters are already enough to bring that tension that we love so much. It has to be said that the cast is very well chosen. Every single one of them looks like a bandit, or just a mean guy you wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley. But what to say about the soundtrack? Ennio Morricone is or was (since he passed this year) the master of soundtracks. Who doesn't know those typical spaghetti western soundtracks, we all heared them before and we can all whistle them during the movie. To this day I still think Morricone has the most recognizable soundtracks. This soundtrack was in fact the first I ever bought on cd later on, a masterpiece if you ask me, the perfect sound to add to the suspense during the stand offs in this movie. The stand offs in this western are legendary, like in all other Sergio Leone westerns in fact. The only negative I could write about the sound in this western would be the fistfights that don't sound real, I guess that wasn't their forte in 1965. The acting on the other hand was just mesmerizing. Lee Van Cleef (one of my all time favorites in these kind of movies) and Clint Eastwood did a terrific job with their characters, but also Gian Maria Volont\u00e8 and the young Klaus Kinski. This movie will forever stay a classic in this genre, after so many years it's still as enjoyable to watch as the first time I watched it.

It is, nevertheless, easy to forget how important this film was in so many ways. Following on from A Fistful of Dollars (1964) Sergio Leone decided a follow up was possible and so began his short but sensational directorial career. Clint Eastwood agreed to star once more, thereby cementing his move from TV to cinema and becoming an international star along the way, not mention becoming many a young teen's poster hero. Lee Van Cleef, who had had a successful but largely unnoticed film career, that began with a small part in High Noon (1952) was brought in to co-star. His rise to fame would not be as meteoric as Eastwood's but his mesmerising performance ensured a big enough future with many fine roles. Luigi Pistilli was retained from the first film and his solid performance and good looks would ensure that he too would make many more high profile films, particularly in the world of the giallo but also more such westerns and crime films. Indeed the film world in Italy had already begun to explode with more such Italian style westerns, after the first film, but now the phenomenon was unstoppable and the term spaghetti western was coined to describe the genre that had given that traditional old tired, gentlemanly and sentimental American one such a successful twist into life. Enio Morricone, man of musical magic, had been working in film for some five years but it was this one and recordings of his soundtrack that also shot him to fame and fortune all around the world. A position of such acclaim, of course, that last even to today. Many have written of the film itself and I will restrict myself to commenting on the high quality of cinematography, the determination to make every frame look good and to supplement these attractive images with many a close-up of the characterful individuals, chosen surely at least in part for those very faces. In conclusion I must mention the considerable length for a film with such a fairly simple storyline and say that although there may be a slight slowing towards the last part of the first half when we maybe think the whole film will be following one baddie after another for apprehension, 'dead or alive' we instead encounter Gian Maria Volonte and his men and from there on there is no looking back - that will be the task of the participants, for there will surely be at least one guy with a gun coming up behind, or over the roof, or out of the window. All accompanied by that instantly recognisable music, teasingly introduced bit by bit at first and finally as a suitably crescendo like accompaniment to the stylised mayhem of the macaroni western, as the Japanese would say.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 6}, "heading": "A thrilling and wonderful looking film", "date": "2020-07-10T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5894606"}, {"content": "Clint Eastwood might be at his absolute best in this film, as part of the dollars trilogy I would give this one the best rating even though The Good The Bad and The Ugly gets all the praise.

Be careful how you interpret the word trilogy though, these aren't linked, they are just a good collection of films with similar actors in.This film isn't just a great western, but it's actually a great film outside the world of the genre too (yes it is a western, but think of how it's constructed in comparison to other films, all he ingredients are there!). It's exciting, gripping and has lots of atmosphere and emotion. The 3 central stars, Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Volonte) all deliver great performances. Wrapped up in Leone's brilliant direction and writing, with Ennio Morricone's perfect musical score - this is a fantastic film all around. What Leone does particularly well, apart from painting an absorbing artistic canvas on screen with scenery and characters, is to show that good guys and bad guys can overlap.

Likewise, the bad guy sometimes do have good side or morality.Due to being created to depict a certain period of time, the film itself doesn't lose anything with age.

Who does n't like the story of happy enmity?\nMovies are the art of dream-making and visual wonders.\nEveryone seems to have thought about robbing the bank, but they have not put it into practice. The movie helped us achieve what we thought. It seems a little difficult to rob the bank in China. Basically, I do n't see many stories of Chinese filming robbing the bank. Is it because the bank is state-owned, it belongs to public property, and robbing the bank is an act of digging the corner of socialism. In a capitalist country, robbing the bank is a legitimate act, because this is part of the class struggle.\nOn the other hand, no weapons have been regulated since ancient times. China is not a society with a general gun, so there is no such western film, nor soil for the gunman duel, instead it is a martial arts film. The stories of Tianya endlessly emerged, mainly due to the struggle between officials and the people. To be precise, various martial arts characters appeared only when the world was in chaos.\nThere is also the lack of public power. In human history, it can be said that justice is a substitute for revenge, but justice is also a suppression of revenge. In fact, even revenge is a system to suppress the revenge that is allowed to dominate the emotions. This revenge is too bloody, it will be excessive, and it will definitely infringe on the innocent. Therefore, it will surely trigger a circular revenge, which will lead to a world revenge and prevent all related people There are peaceful expectations. Therefore, the practice of \"returning teeth with teeth and eyes to eyes\", the norm of \"reporting complaints directly\", and the earliest justice when society has surplus products, all of which are no longer to satisfy the desires of the Avengers Rather, it is for the sake of social public interest to punish those who infringe on the rights and interests of others in a controlled manner, in order to suppress people's revenge.So in the modern story, there is no such kind of happy revenge, and go directly to the story of revenge, and instead resort to public power, such as Zhang Yimou's Qiu Ju to sue.Modern people in life will definitely feel that this method is not hateful, so we will like to watch this kind of happy story.\nThe other is that bounty hunters have replaced public power to a certain extent and are maintaining public order.\nFinally, there is cooperation and game.Everyone wants to get the most, and finally get nothing, the mantis catches the cicada, and the cardinals are in the end, and finally lose more.Think more about others, lose a little, and have opportunities for cooperation in the future.\nThe cooperation of the bounty hunters defeated the divided robbers.\nThe bounty hunter, who represents justice and needs revenge with a moral advantage, defeated the robber.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 3}, "heading": "Bloody two men", "date": "2020-05-02T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5699267"}, {"content": "Exceptional performances by three heavyweight actors, Gian Maria Volonte and Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood, along with great direction, editing, cinematography and gripping and unique music by the great Ennio Morricone, make this movie a real standout.

Even though I enjoyed the first film I was pretty surprised how much better this installment holds up to this day! The pacing is not actually that slow (which was my biggest issue regarding the first film) and the acting is excellent. It's entertaining to watch the cooperation between Monco (Clint Eastwood) and Col. Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef). Without spoiling anything I can say that Lee Van Cleefs character is in no way weak, he seems to have a troubled past which makes the viewer care for him. The villain \"Indio\" (Gian Maria Volont\u00e8) is extremely unlikable in the way a villain should be because of his earlier decisions. The score is also amazing and really gives you that western vibe that this trilogy is so great at delivering. At the end my only problem with this film is kind of nit pick, but it's a nit pick that can confuse people that have watched \"A Handful of Dollars\". The villain is played by the same actor who played the villain of the first movie, which is pretty misleading since he's not playing the same villain/character.Overall I think any fans of the art of film should watch this film.

Along the way, he meets \"Manco\", a notorious Bounty Hunter who is also after the same man. They team up, hoping to destroy the large outlaw gang and get paid handsomely.This film is better than A Fistful of Dollars by a long shot. There is better music, more compelling characters, and the screen direction is excellent. The plot is also a bit more complex which leads to an enjoyable experience. It is truly art.One of the best parts of this film, in my opinion, is Lee Van Cleef's Colonel Mortimer. He plays a very lawful man with a good motive. The rape and suicide of his sister is a stunning cause for revenge. I am used to watching Van Cleef playing villains, but his time as a clear hero feels like he brings gravity to the role.This contrasts with \"Manco\", a mysterious man named \"Joe\" in the last time, played by Clint Eastwood. He still has the same grim outlook in this one, but he definitely feels like he's changed at this point in history. He's more compassionate. He still acts larger than life, and in the final duel between Mortimer and Indio, he acts like an almighty and watchful mediator over the small duel between the two men. It's brilliant.El Indio is one of the most wicked villains in all of cinema. He shows no remorse for his actions, and the music from Morricone adds to his thoughts with the strange buzzing and chaotic music for him. He's cold blooded and only serves himself. Yet, he's strangely deep for such a irredeemable villain.Ennio Morricone's music adds to much to the movie. It sounds like the beating of the hot sun overcoming the landscape and atmosphere, springy yet deadly. I don't think Leone would have nearly made an impact in this film without the impressive soundtrack.The biggest flaw this film suffers from is once again a slow start, and some of the film is rather confusing. It needed a better time communicating it's plot, as the audience feels clueless in some instances of what Manco is doing. Yes, he is mysterious, but it is just hard to follow.Overall, a great film. I feel it is underrated in the trilogy, but serves as a good bookend to the character of The Man with No Name. Of course, the third film would be The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, but the story chronologically ends here.

The film is a bit slow for today standards but it doesn't care because it is highly entertaining and satisfying at the end. Indeed the slowest parts of the movie are the Sergio Leone's close-ups on the characters' face expressions, which thanks to an excellent cast create characterization and convey emotional tension. This is particularly true for the gun duels where the eyes of the characters study each other at the point where the viewers can almost feel the soul of the challengers. And in this duels there is a great expedient: the two gunfighters have to shot when the music from a pocket watch stops and this simple element gives freedom to the great Ennio Morricone to shine. The score is indeed fantastic and highly memorable with some few themes that will be impressed in the mind even after the end of the movie. As I said all the cast was exceptional but I have to give a special mention to Lee Van Cleef who portrays the colonel Douglas Mortimer, whose character form an alliance with Monco (Clint Eastwood) to take down El Indio (Gian Maria Volont\u00e8), that I felt stole every scene he's in.\n\"For a few dollars more\" isn't a movie about moral messages but it doesn't pretend to be neither.

Whereas A Fistful of Dollars was still a fantastic adaption of Kurosawa's 'Yojimbo', Leone's wholly original story in For a Few Dollars More allows his direction to shine a lot more due to the fact that there is no direct comparison.For a Few Dollars More arguably has some of the greatest introductory scenes of main characters ever seen in film. Colonel Douglas Mortimer's ( Lee van Cleef ) menacing stare towards a passenger in the train, the convincing ability to use the emergency brake and get away with it just because nobody dares mess with him, or the cold and calculated way he eventually kills his bounty target with not a slight sense of nerves or fear. Monco's ( Clint Eastwood ) card game against his target in which he later reveals that he was playing for his life, and afterwards continuing to smack him down with karate chops from his left hand only. The simplicity with which he turns around and kills three adversaries and the seemingly eyes in his back move when his target reaches for a gun. All of this tells the story of the main characters brilliantly in their introduction sequence. Let us also not forget Indio's ( Gian Maria Volonte ) introduction sequence in which he is rescued from jail by his gang and searches for payback on the person who sold him out. He has no trouble killing this man's family, but the duality in his eyes and the fact that he gives him a chance in a fair duel state that there is some kind of weird morality in him, and this continues for the entire film. Thus these introductory sequences are some of the absolute best in cinematic history, because i for one can't think of another that manages to put so much character personality in just these intro's.This movie doesn't have a single bad scene. In fact, it is a consequent series of superb scenes. The entire film is just a testosterone filled thrill ride of epic proportions. The fearlessness and masculinity displayed by especially these two main characters is nothing short of spectacular. One of the risks when you have these two seemingly superhumanly quick protagonists is that you are unable to relate with them because they are never in trouble. However, like all great action hero's, there is one scene in particular where both are at their most vulnerable, and this scene makes them look human. Incredibly manly and superhumanly accurate and quick humans, but humans nonetheless. They are just as vulnerable as anybody else. Nowadays this only makes the film better because the age of masculinity in men is far behind us, and this film reminds us of a glorious time in which men were still considered as men.The score by Ennio Morricone is as you might expect once again absolutely stunning, with a soothing and yet somewhat epic whistling tune throughout. The marching shots of people on horseback with the widescreen direction of Leone while Morricone's score is playing is just visually stunning, and the sound design ( Every single sound was shot pre-production as the film was shot silent ) is impeccable. The sheer sound of Mortimer's revolver will probably haunt you for some days to come.Now one point i feel is always overlooked in this film is Indio, who is no doubt one of the greatest villains ever created in cinema. This is because while this is a character that is evil personified in a lot of his actions throughout the film, there is a sense of true sadness and regret in him, and you can constantly see this in his facial expressions which is ofcourse all thanks to the brilliant acting by Gian Maria Volonte. There isn't any joy either when you see him killing the guy that snitched on him to get him in jail. His eyes just show constant sorrow, perhaps for what he has become, or perhaps because of a certain flashback event shown later on. This is a very morally complex villain, because even though he is evil, there is a duality in him, a struggle between his good and bad side. All of this is shown without dialogue, but instead with just looking at these fantastic Leone close ups of Indio's facial expressions. In a strange way, we as the audience still kind of feel for Indio because of this.The dialogue, particularly the ones between Monco & Mortimer about if Mortimer was ever young, or the re-meet of Wild ( Klaus Kinski ) & Mortimer is also perhaps a bit of an overlooked point in this film. Dialogue, as is usual in Leone films, is only there to further the narrative, and not tell the audience things we can already figure out for ourselves. But these little conversations as the one mentioned above are really just the perfect talks when you consider the personalities of these characters. Leone understood his characters, and never made them contradict their personalities.The final 10 or 15 minutes are some of the greatest closing minutes in a film ever. The flashback sequences featuring Indio are explained and a twist is confirmed with just a single line of dialogue ( Naturally, between brother and sister ). The closeups in this duel between Indio and Mortimer while Morricone's incredible watch chimes ( Combined with an epic trumpet halfway through ) plays is just cinematic perfection. Van Cleef in particular manages to convey so many emotions in these close ups, emotions that he has managed to leave behind him for everything else in the film. However, when facing his sister's killer you can truly see the desperation and sadness in van Cleef's eyes in these scenes. The little things are also what make this scene so great, such as van Cleef stroking the picture of his sister in the locket a bit in a melancholy kind of way, or a quick glance he gives to the now dead Indio after picking it up. It is just pure perfection.For a Few Dollars More is not just one of the greatest westerns ever made, but it is also one of the greatest films ever made. It does not have the scope and scale of Leone's later masterpieces like The Good, the Bad & the Ugly or Once Upon a Time in the West, but it comes close nonetheless, and the result here is just a fantastic motion picture.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 5, "votes": 8}, "heading": "Once upon a time when men were still men...", "date": "2018-09-29T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4367171"}, {"content": "Without a doubt, one of the best Westerns ever.

Situations and the plot are designed specifically for the fans of this genre. It is the 2nd film of the Dollars trilogy, which is also known as The Man with No Name. The films in the trilogy have nothing to do with each other in the means of story, but after seeing the 2nd film, it starts to make sense to me why they are called a trilogy. Even though the stories are completely unrelated, these films are gathered more or less around a similar plot. Soundtracks are equally beautiful, the leading actor, Clint Eastwood, stars in all three films. Even the names of the first two films are completing each other. \"For a Few Dollars More\" is more serious and complex compared to the first film of the trilogy, A Fistful of Dollars. From the point of view of action and story, I find this one more satisfying. You can feel that, in \"For a Few Dollars More,\" director Sergio Leone has more trust in himself because of the success of the first film. He is more focused and his distinctive directing style is more visible in this one. The leading actors Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef are completing each other. The villain El Indio, played by Gian Maria Volonte, seems to be the evilest character of the Western films I have ever seen. Besides the performances, soundtracks and the western atmosphere are the strongest points of the film. Even though there is well-structured story, you get the feeling that, things are happening based on the situations. It seems like the characters don't follow a plan, but react to incidents. This makes the film more complex and hard to anticipate.Lee Van Cleef, as Colonel Douglas Mortimer, is added to the second film as an experienced bounty hunter. This gives Sergio Leone a strong hand to play with, he is not limited in the means of characters. This liberty makes him create a better, a more independent story. Clint Eastwood, as Manco, is the other bounty hunter. His role is more or less the same as the first film. He wears the same clothes, talks the same, acts the same and even the way he smokes his tobacco is the same. He is a complete icon for western films. He shares the leading role with Lee Van Cleef, and this removes the responsibility from his shoulders to carry the film on his own. Sergio Leone uses Eastwood in the roles that are more suitable for him, which creates a more reliable character.Both Colonel Douglas Mortimer and Manco are highly talented gunmen, who make living out of the prize money issued for capturing or killing outlaws on the loose. We get to know Colonel Mortimer, Manco and the psychopath outlaw El Indio in the first scenes of the film. These scenes create a credibility for the future references. We are highly aware of what these men are capable of doing. After El Indio is taken out from the jail by his gang, a prize money of 10k USD is issued on his head. Mortimer and Manco decide to go after this guy, for different reasons, which are revealed in the end of the film. When they find out about each other, they decide to team up against El Indio and his gang.The film plays host for the iconic scenes where Mortimer and Manco shoot each other's hats, or the old man talking about the train company who wanted to buy his house to make a railway for the train and how he didn't sell it. \"For a Few Dollars More\" is a film where English-speaking guys are leading the roles made by Italian speaking people. Like the first film, this one is also a co-production of Italy, West Germany and Spain. Clint Eastwood's presence was critical for the second film, and it was not easy to convince him to star in it because he hasn't seen the first film and didn't know what to expect from it. So, the production company sent a copy of the film to him, which was Italian back then, and Eastwood gathered his friends and watched it. Based on his friends' positive feedbacks he accepted the role for a total sum of 50K USD which is 3 times more than his salary for the previous film. \"For a Few Dollars More\" has everything in it about western genre. It is action packed, highly enjoyable and satisfying. Because of the reasons I have counted above, \"For a Few Dollars More\" is one of the best films of its genre.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Alive or dead?

A Fistful of Dollars is a great film: revolutionary, gritty, violent, and fun, and it certainly was the true beginning of a monumental change in westerns. However, this is the first film where Leone's brilliance fully comes to the front. On the other hand, while not quite as famous (in the English-speaking world) as the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (GBU) and perhaps not quite as great a cinematic achievement as GBU or Once Upon a Time in the West (OUTIW), this film is nevertheless not far behind those clear masterpieces. The characteristic Leone visual style and incredible artistry are very powerful here. Although some of this is evident in small amounts in the previous film, here we really get to see the incredible, revolutionary close-ups and the contrast between close- ups and long shots. These and other images are powerful and beautiful. The film also brings the deliberate pacing and wonderful, almost unbearable, build-up of tension before quick action. Leone's sense of irony and brilliant weaving together of various motifs and symbols (particularly religious) also comes to the forefront in this film, as does the humour. Just seeing the quality of the images, the photography, and the cool faces (I can't imagine a western hunter with other type of face), makes this movie excellent. The plot is not very complicated and you can argue some decisions made by the villain, but even with that, I think is very intelligent and probably by that you can't guess what is next. Eastwood, Cliff and 'El Indio' are good in their roles and the direction of Leone is superb. No doubt, Leone can be considered the best western director of all time, not by one movie but for his complete work. This would be the only film from the Dollars Trilogy (between A Fistful of Dollars and The Good, The Bad.& the Ugly) that isn't an Empire 5-star rated film. So, in order to complete the trilogy, I decided to watch this one anyway to satisfy my need for completion to see why it wasn't awarded the prestigious five stars. Compared with A Fistful Of Dollars, For A Few Dollars More is a far more developed film, albeit a completely different story. The stories lead into each other though (although you don't need to watch the first to understand the second), as The Man With No Name continues his bounty work which we are introduced to in the predecessor. As \"Fistful\" did, \"Few Dollars More\" has plenty of throwaway moments and parts that are shallow and uninteresting, but the style is one all of its own and Leone deserves continued celebration for the way his movies rewrote the essentials of the Western formula. Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef are bounty hunters on the trail of El Indio (Gian Maria Volont\u00e8). Eastwood is out for the money, but Van Cleef has other motives. Bullets fly, bodies are stacked like cord wood, and the action never stops all to incredible music by Ennio Morricone. The movie far outshines most of American westerns.Lee Van Cleef is great as veteran bounty killer and the same goes to Clint Eastwood. Gian Volante puts up a good performance as the evil Indio. The plot is a little slow but look at \"High Noon\" or any of the other old westerns.An all time great western!! performance of \"El Indio\" in this movie is real high class no doubt.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Gangster El Indio what a villain (*_*)", "date": "2017-09-23T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3812702"}, {"content": "FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE is a spaghetti Western film about two mysterious bounty hunter and a group of bandits led by a notorious murderer, rapist and robber. Mr. Leone has made again an exciting film full of a vivid violence, fistfights and shooting. He brings, through the relationship between the protagonist and mysterious flashbacks, an interesting combination between the danger, uncertainty and threat, which is a novelty in the genre.The two bounty hunter are separately introduced, while they hunt down and kill wanted outlaws to collect bounty. Meanwhile, a gang of outlaws breaks into a prison to free their leader, a clever, ruthless and psychotic \"El Indio\". The bounty hunters are interested in the large reward offered for the notorious fugitive and his group. None of them does not want competition in his work, though, they're hiding their true motives and join forces in their undertaking...In this film almost everything is done in a harmonious way, but an unpredictable and uncertain conflict between the three main characters is the biggest asset of this film. A fearless killing machine, an experienced and righteous colonel and an intelligent and ruthless madman guarantee an uncertain fun. An excellent direction and precisely arranged dynamics between a conversation, shots, violence and death enhance visual stimulation to the maximum. Therefore, a fiction has, through emotional and violent appearances, moral values and justifications, completely understandable context.The atmosphere is amazing, characterization is pretty good and the soundtrack is phenomenal.Clint Eastwood as Manco (the \"Man with No Name\") is somehow emotionally crippled and fearless killing machine. A harmonious movement, which corresponds very well with a change in his character at the end of the film are well designed. Mr. Eastwood has offered a convincing performance. Lee Van Cleef as Colonel Douglas Mortimer is an experienced character with a mysterious purpose. He was once a great soldier, now is a great bounty hunter. The revenge does not choose the means. Gian Maria Volont\u00e8 as El Indio is simply brilliant in the role of a ruthless bandit. Klaus Kinski as Wild, the hunchback has drew my attention with his impatient mad expressions.

The man with no name strikes again, and Clint Eastwood is the man with no gimmicks, the guy just doesn't need one, he oozes charisma and demands respect without even needing to open his mouth. Lee Van Cleef plays a great foil for the western legend, but his natural charm and efficiency has to give way for that of Eastwood's, you just knew from the beginning of their partnership who would walk away looking stronger, nobody outshines Eastwood, nobody. I like westerns for their vastness and attempts to venture into the unknown, spaghetti westerns are a particular favourite, Sergio Leone is capable of assembling a cast of relatively unknown foreigners to star alongside the two American leads and just make it work, make a classic out of it. The Dollars trilogy are proper old school, grown up films..., a time before the younger generations took control, cluttered with prima donas and kids who consider themselves to be hard, no-no you're not hard, not at all, Clint Eastwood's hard, the older generations were hard, and this trilogy of films is a shining example. I loved the sound of the gunfire echoing and reverberating across the landscape, loud and raw, you don't get that in film anymore..., I loved Ennio Morricone's haunting score, some of the best music in film I've ever heard, the closet thing to perfect you'll ever hear..., and I loved the slower more methodical pacing of the film, it doesn't go head first or a hundred miles an hour, it's slow at times almost to a crawl, it builds tension and adds to brilliance. El Indio the main antagonist of the film is revolting, a hideous, heartless man with no morals, I was impressed that a character was created such as this without making him over the top and overly animated, he like a lot of the film is slow, somewhat lazily, but he's truly disgusting nonetheless. For a Few Dollars More was released during a transitional time in Hollywood, gone was the golden era but the New Hollywood era hadn't quite reared its head just yet, therefore I don't quite know what era to class this film as, I'm going to go with neither, it doesn't have a category, it stands alone with its two other trilogy mates, making all three films that extra bit special, they staggered the line between two distinctive eras.

Far from the glamorized depictions in movies starring John Wayne, Roy Rogers and Gene Autry (where the men are clean-shaven and the women wear fancy dresses), the spaghetti westerns depicted the old west as dismal and the people as greasy. I understand that the area in Spain where they filmed these movies is known as the Frying Pan (when my parents went to Spain, they drove through the town where a lot of the movies got filmed).Anyway, there's a good time to be had here.

If you've seen several Spaghetti Westerns from the 60s-70s then you know that the ones by Leone are a notch or two above the other ones in overall quality, but I usually find his stories and the overall presentation kinda dull, albeit somewhat entrancing. Not to mention these early ones (\"A Fistful of Dollars\" and this one) are hindered by laughable sound effects (like punches) and bad English dubbing. Then there's the incongruent mixing of seriousness with goofy humor, like when hats are shot off a dude's head without a scratch. Why Sure!\"For a Few\u0085\" comes across as a dress rehearsal for the superior \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,\" which was made the next year. Like that one, there's no female character of any note and the overlong flick ends with an allegedly suspenseful gunfight between the three main characters. Speaking of which, Gian Maria Volont\u00e8 is notably charismatic as El Indio. There's this myth going around that Leone's Dollars trilogy introduced the concept of the antihero, otherwise known as the \"good (or likable) bad man.\" Actually, the antihero had been around for decades when \"Fistful\" was released in '64. Take, for example, John Wayne's Ringo Kid in \"Stagecoach\" (1939) or Richard Widmark's Comanche Todd in \"The Last Wagon\" (1956) or Anthony Quinn's Bob Kallen in \"The Ride Back\" (1957) and, particularly, Brando's Kid Rio in \"One-Eyed Jacks\" (1961). These are just off the top of my head.The difference with Eastwood's antihero in Leone's Man With No Name trilogy is that, unlike the antiheroes above, he is without personality, unless squinting, shooting and smoking cheroots are taken as profound marks of character. In Short, Leone introduced the antihero CARICATURE as opposed to the antihero CHARACTER. Cool caricatures work just fine when you're in your teens or early 20s, but after you mature a bit you naturally desire more three-dimensional and believable characters. The film runs 132 minutes and was shot in Granada, Almer\u00eda & Colmenar Viejo, Spain, with interiors done in Rome.

For a sequel that was reluctantly whipped up in short order, \"For a Few Dollars More\" demonstrates notable growth for the filmmaker.There's a lot more breadth and debatably even depth to \"Few Dollars More.\" Clint Eastwood's Joe was the only interesting thing on screen in \"Fistful,\" but in this film, Monco, as he's called, might not even be the best character.Lee Van Cleef takes a co-starring role as Col. Douglas Mortimer, a sharp-shooting bounty hunter like Manco who becomes entangled with our other anti-hero when the two pursue the high bounty on El Indio (Gian Maria Volonte), a notorious gang leader and criminal who has been broken out of prison. Monco and Mortimer strike a deal when they realize they stand more to gain by collaborating than by getting in each other's way. They both suspect that Indio and his gang will rob the supposedly impenetrable bank in El Paso and connive to thwart their plan from the inside.Van Cleef isn't a scene-stealer, but he carries himself behind a greater shroud of mystery than Eastwood, who has already shown us all his moves, at least as The Man with No Name. The script gives him all the same tricks, but we can't be sure what to expect of Mortimer, which Van Cleef leverages to his advantage.El Indio is also much more of a menacing presence than anything we got in \"Fistful,\" which substituted the classic villain for a m\u00e9lange of despicable characters, The Man with No Name included. Volonte starred as one of those shallow, unmemorable outlaws, and his turn as El Indio makes you doubt whether this is the same actor. The writing (Luciano Vincenzoni) makes a difference. El Indio is a colorful villain with a sinister yet human component giving him more dimensions. The touch of the musical pocket watch that haunts his enemies or anyone he wishes to stand against yet also haunts him shows a level of sophistication that's almost unexpected for a Spaghetti Western. \"Few Dollars More\" might not have the best one- liners of the trilogy, but the plot holds more weight.Tension is a hallmark of \"Few Dollars More\" that \"Fistful\" is largely missing. The impending showdown between Monco, Mortimer and El Indio holds a lot of promise. We've seen what all sides are capable of in compelling ways. A more telling sign of this difference is that \"Fistful\" has twice the death toll of \"Few Dollars More\" yet in the latter, Leone really makes the body count, well, count. Both are \"shoot 'em up\" movies that emphasize genre thrills, but this movie is distinctly more dramatic.As a director, Leone is a little more creative in \"Fistful,\" but sometimes to the movie's detriment. \"Few Dollars More\" is a little more by the numbers, but Leone seems to have a better read on what the best shot is in any given scenario to evoke the desired response in the viewer. He knows what was cool and sleek about \"Fistful\" and leans more on that in this movie. There's something breathtaking about the way he does close-ups that has so few equals in all of cinematic history, especially in genre films.You can't end a Leone review without talking about composer Ennio Morricone and honestly, the sound mixing in general. The themes Morricone gives to each character and the way he melds them into the more complex compositions has more to do with the enjoyment of Leone's films than you would initially give it credit for. He does rollicking theme music as expertly as he does the more intimate, suspenseful moments. Mixed together with prolific gunshots, galloping and more, so much of the live and style of these movies supports itself on a bed of exciting sound.As \"Fistful\" did, \"Few Dollars More\" has plenty of throwaway moments and parts that are shallow and uninteresting, but the style is one all of its own and Leone deserves continued celebration for the way his movies rewrote the essentials of the Western formula.~Steven CThanks for reading!

He gets particularly riled when he spots a wanted poster for Indio (Volonte), a dope smoking bank robber who has just been busted out of jail. Mortimer's going to find out that he's not the only hunter on Indio's tail, as the Man With No Name (called Manko here) is also out to get that bounty.It takes about an hour for the above paragraph to happen, but you won't care. In that time we find that Indio is holding a dark secret he keeps at bay with drugs, and has something to do with that pocket watch he carries. We also get to see that the Bounty Hunters are just as deadly as the bad guys too, and there's a kind of battle of the wills going on between Eastwood and Van Cleef.This film is exactly what you want from a Spaghetti Western. Reality goes out of the window and instead you get a film where men can stop and start spurs spinning by shooting them, or continually shoot a hat up into the air, or light a match off of Klaus Kinski's hump. It's all look amazing too, thanks to Massimo Dallamano's cinematography, which looks like an oil painting (he does the same in his own Western, Bandidos).Luigi Pistilli stands out in this one too, as one of the smarter members of Indio's gang, which is maybe why he's got a bigger role in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. Of course Klaus Kinski appears in more Spaghetti Westerns than anyone else, including The Fighting Fists Of Shanghai Joe, His Name Is King, And God Said To Cain, (continues listing films)", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 3}, "heading": "\"Thought there was something wrong with my adding\"", "date": "2017-04-29T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3696417"}, {"content": "For A Few Dollars More (1965)Plot In A Paragraph: Two bounty hunters Monco (Clint Eastwood) and Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) join forces to track the outlaw El Indio who has just broke out of prison.With triple the budget of A Fistful Of Dollars, Leone delivers a movie that is longer, funnier and bloodier than its predecessor.

One of the reasons for this is the display of talent. Lee Van Cleef and Gian Maria Volont\u00e8 deliver great performances as Colonel Mortimer and El Indio, respectively. Volont\u00e8 portrays his character with a level of complexity and expressiveness rarely seen in the Western genre, whilst Van Cleef is given a central part in the film's most memorable and entertaining scenes - the 'match-striking scene', the 'hat-shooting scene', and the inevitable standoff. Clint Eastwood's iconic character is always entertaining to watch, but I think the most meaningful moments in the film come from his reluctant ally (Van Cleef) and his enemy (Volont\u00e8). The technical aspects of this film are just as good as those in 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'. Whilst some of the cinematography and of course the soundtrack in the third film are by far the most memorable, Leone's crew managed to create an appropriate visual and musical atmosphere for this darker, more brooding film.

Who wouldn't be? Few such works of uninhibited masculinity exist, and fewer still are entertaining enough to maintain my interest for more than an hour at a time, much less three. Fewer still pulsate with the raw energy and power embodied in those empty spaces, those quiet staring contests between men capable of blowing each other to bits with a twitch of their dusty digits, those treacherous wastelands, those hostile encounters, and those crusty, bearded, cigarette-chewing men imbued with only a desire to survive and succeed, no matter the cost. And in the case of this film, fewer still can boast being the established icons of the genre, the first films that come associated with the word \"Western\".Then why is For a Few Dollars More as middling as it is? In my humble opinion, For a Few Dollars More pales in comparison to its predecessor, the wonderfully entertaining Fistful of Dollars. The reasons for this are not few in number, but rather small in breadth. Basic, technical slip-ups resulting in an experience that feels curiously thinner and less satisfying. Sure, For a Few Dollars More has its moments, but when taken as a whole, it's a forgettable film that lacks the intelligence, energy, and sheer grit of the first and third films in Sergio Leone's legendary Dollars trilogy.As with its predecessor (but unlike its sequel), For a Few Dollars More concerns itself with moments rather than a calculated execution of a narrative. This in itself is excusable; it leads to a sort of haphazard adventure tinged with potent thrill. A scant narrative is undoubtedly better than one burdened by inscrutable complexity. But For a Few Dollars More simply can't deliver on those moments comprising its sustenance. Most of them, excluding a fantastic scene involving hats -- which I consider the second best scene in the whole trilogy -- are honestly quite boring. Leone draws them out to unnecessary length, which, while delivering on his old West portraits of masculinity, seem to stretch on indefinitely without sufficient reason or motivation. This effect is worsened by the fact that Leone gives us little to care about. In the first film, one could easily appreciate Eastwood's raw intelligence; after some time, it would be easy to care about him, at least to the point that you hope that he survives the predicament in which he finds himself.In a Few Dollars More, Eastwood's character is sidelined to allow Lee Van Cleef, who plays another superhuman bounty killer, to take center stage. And Van Cleef's cockiness destroys any notion of sympathy we might have had for him, while Eastwood, without sufficient space to exercise his intelligence, becomes a violent rodent far removed from the Bugs Bunny-ish wit of his original character. The villain is interesting as well, but Leone spends too much time making him seem troubled which serves little purpose. I don't like it when writers see fit to direct our sympathy towards unsympathetic characters. If Leone wanted to insert some effective character development, he should have given the villain's henchmen more screen time. By the time the film reached its disjointed and confusing climactic battle, I was still trying to figure out who everyone even was.The rest of the film is a whole lot of sitting and waiting. The innovation runs dry by the second half and the thrills die quickly off the mark. The action scenes feel limp and overdone while the staredowns become predictable. The ending is nowhere near as satisfying as the ending of Fistful of Dollars. And as with the other two, the dubbing is disgusting.I'm a sucker for Westerns, yes, but that doesn't mean that I'm completely blind to mediocrity.

This is mainly because a higher budget is evident, especially in the better cast. Once again, Ennio Morricone creates an appropriate and, it has to be said, brilliantly evocative score which is a highlight of the whole film. Although the running time comes in at two hours, this time flies by and is packed with plot twists and turns.The scorching desert locations are once again realistic and scene-setting; I especially liked the use of a white-walled ghost town which appears towards the film's end. Clint Eastwood reprises his role of The Man With No Name to great effect, although even here his thunder is stolen by Lee Van Cleef, who stars as a rival bounty hunter. Van Cleef is superb in this film, a real icon, and this is the film that made him famous. He has his lines and mannerisms directly right and the character seems to have been written for him, he fits it so well. The two men are supported by a criminal gang of really seedy-looking bad guys, headed by the excellent Gian Maria Volonte as Indio, the ruthless yet honourable murderer and robber who proves a worthwhile opponent for Eastwood and Van Cleef to take on. Klaus Kinski is also good in a small role as a hunchback whom Van Cleef uses to light a match - an act that Kinski isn't too pleased about.Opening with two well-staged scenes highlighting the shooting abilities of Eastwood and Van Cleef as they both track down wanted criminals, this film is well-photographed and edited throughout, with a sufficiently complex plot to carry it through. The ending is brilliant, and a classic one, with Morricone's powerful score suddenly sweeping over the final shoot-out. Things end on a high note with a great joke as well.

The bad news is that it's a sequel mostly in name, but the good (great) news is that it's every bit as deliciously violent and captivating as its predecessor.Clint Eastwood returns, although he's no longer The Man with No Name; he's Monco, a \"bounty killer\" \u2013 not a bounty hunter, because that might imply he intends to bring 'em back alive. Monco has his eyes on a desperado named Indio, played by Italian actor Gian Maria Volont\u00e8. Trouble is, another bounty killer, name of Colonel Mortimer (Lee van Cleef) also wants Indio. The fact that the man has a reward of $10,000 on his head probably figures into things a little. Add in the rest of the gang, and you're looking at maybe $27,000. Which today I assume would be $75 million. I don't know, you look it up.Mortimer and Monco do decide to team up; after all, we can't have too many bad guys. That doesn't mean that they won't try to double cross one another. The plan is for Monco to infiltrate Indio's band and get him to move north, toward the town of El Paso, where they'll attempt to rob the town's Fort-Knox-like bank. Oh, Indio goes north all right, with Monco, and the bank is hit, but\u0085well, let's just say things don't go as planned for anyone.For a Few Dollars More is an epic, even though it's \"only\" 132 minutes long. I mean it's an epic in the same way that Lawrence of Arabia is an epic, with majestic, sweeping vistas followed by (in Leone's case) extreme closeups of the three leads. There are duels in the streets, just as you'd expect a western to have. For all I know, this happened all the time, and in this movie it happens repeatedly. Still, it's not as if every fight is carefully sanctioned, as there are plenty of ambushes to be found.This was the middle film in the series that really put the then-somewhat-young Eastwood on the map. Van Cleef's Mortimer calls him \"kid,\" and Eastwood's calls Mortimer \"old man\"; in reality, the two were only five years apart in age. Eastwood, of course, is still kicking; he turned 86 a couple of months ago. Maybe his days as a taciturn gunslinger are long behind him, but he's still a creative genius. And he learned a lot of the directorial tricks of the trade from Leone himself, a master of the western genre.

Sticking by Indio, Klaus Kinski gives a terrific performance as Juan Wild.Despite only having limited dialogue,Kinski makes his presence strongly felt across the title,with Kinski's wry smile displaying the terror that Indio and his gang plan to cast across the west.Considering to become a landscape artist before his move to Spaghetti Westerns led to a career revival, Lee Van Cleef gives a mesmerising performance as Col. Douglas Mortimer,with Cleff's stern eyes giving the movie a dry wit,as Mortimer drops the cards from his chest one by one.Holding a deep grudge against Indio,Cleff lights up the film with a burning intensity,thanks to Cleff giving Mortimer a brittleness which brilliantly expresses the severity of Mortimer's hatred for Indio.Walking back into the Spaghetti Western sun,Clint Eastwood gives a fabulous performance as \"man with no name\" Manco,as Eastwood paints Manco as a tall dark handsome outlaw,whose whip-smart shooting skills are matched by his eagerness to whip up as much cash for the other side as possible.Holding back from fully crossing Indio's gang over with Mortimer and Manco for the first hour,the screenplay by co-writer/(along with Fulvio Morsella/Luciano Vincenzoni/ Sergio Donati & Fernando Di Leo)director Sergio Leone packs each side with their own tensions,with Indio's crumbling brain being joined by Manco keeping an eye out for other outlaws after the wanted dollars.

It's also his second partnership with Clint Eastwood and with Ennio Morricone, one of the most brilliant and prolific soundtrack composers of all time.The basic plot is quite simple, but Leone takes a while to reveal it: during the first 30 minutes we are presented to Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee van Cleef), a quiet and clever bounty hunter specialist in long range shooting, Manco (Eastwood), also a bounty hunter who's very quick on the trigger and with an obscure moral code, and Indio (Volont\u00e9), a twisted and ruthless bandit with a genuine relish to kill. These 3 men stories will naturally cross when Indio, helped by his gang, escapes from prison killing most of the guards what immediately puts a prize on his head, a prize that both bounty hunters want for themselves. Manco and Mortimer eventually meet and, after a tense strength comparison, form a partnership to hunt the villain and his gang, who are in the meantime planning to rob the Bank of El Paso, said to contain a million dollars in a disguised safe. On the center of this story are also two identical musical pocket watches, one used by Mortimer and the other one by Indio. Soon we understand that there is more than money at stake between these 2 men as the pocket watches seem to exert some kind of obsession upon their carriers.For a Few Dollars More has all the advantages of not being the first major spaghetti western, being more mature than its predecessor, For a Fistful of Dollars (1964). Everyone knows now exactly how to do things: Leone has solidified his style and technique, Eastwood and Volont\u00e9 are much more comfortable with their characters (Eastwood, in particular, delivers his best performance on a Leone film) and the new guy, Lee van Cleef is an amazing addition to the cast, lending his coolness and experience to this masterpiece. Also in the acting field, it's a pleasure to watch Klaus Kinski and Luigi Pistilli as member of the gang. Small roles but huge actors!I've already talked about Leone being more mature. In fact, it's his direction that makes of this film such a great one. From beginning to end, the tension is built at a slow yet steady pace, fitting perfectly its 2 hour length. It's not made to be an \"opera\" like Once Upon a Time on the West (1968) or even The Good, The Bad and The Ugly (1965) and it's its almost lack of grandiosity that makes this such a brilliant western. It's hard, gritty and straight to the point and the Italian director is clever enough to make of every aspect of the film perfectly tuned with his concept: the calm but relentless music of Morricone's outstanding soundtrack, the quiet personality of the 3 lead characters, the great pacing management and the glorious cinematography and camera work create the ideal conditions to an apotheotic final duel, where the tension is stretched to an almost nauseating point, and solved with a fast and powerful explosion. And that is Leone's secret: creating impact by contrast.Speaking of the final duel, the key scene of the film, again the musical pocket watches play a very important part. Indio always used the chimes from the watch to begin his duels: \"When you hear the music finish, begin.\" The obsession he had with that watch and the uncertainty created on his opponent of when the music would actually stop, always gave him advantage. However, Mortimer knew well the tune and had even stronger reasons to be attracted by that watch. For the first time, Indio had no initial advantage. On the other hand, Mortimer is using Manco's gun, lighter and smaller than his own, hence faster to draw. The result is not hard to predict and yet the suspense created is breathtaking. When it's all over and the two bounty hunters go separate ways it's hard not to feel a void inside, as we see Mortimer riding to the sunset perhaps not to be seen again.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Who needs opera?", "date": "2015-10-20T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3338836"}, {"content": "For a Few Dollars More (1965) is the best Clint Eastwood Western movie and one of my favorite personal classic western flicks ever!

Douglas Mortimer suggested that the way to break the gang will be easy with one man from the inside of the gang (Monco) , because his younger. The story telling from El Indio about a carpenter who made a big closet were the safe was hiding in it was just plain brilliant.Monco breaks one of Indio's friends out of prison and is admitted to the gang, to prove his loyalty was awesome. The watch that Indio opens during the gun fight scenes and when the song stops by the watch he draw his gun and shoot anyone in the gun fight with him that was so awesome. The last showdown between Col. Douglas Mortimer and El Indio when the song stopped was TERRIFIC!Why I love this movie? Simply because of Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef. I love Lee Van Cleef so much in here because he plays the good guy, he kills bunch of outlaws whit his riffle. He befriends Monco and he kills El Inido on the end. He doesn't split the reward with Monco , but he lets him have it, the money on a honest way. Clint Eastwood as Monco did a fantastic job in one of his best performances as Bounty Killer Monco. He also kills bunch of outlaws, he also shoot Mortimer's hat, he never shoots an Innocent or unarmed person, that is why I love this actor and his character so much. Gian Maria Volont\u00e9 did a good job on another style he also never shoot unarmed person, he only did that once for a women he fall in love. Mortimer's sister, on the end of the film it was reveled why Col. Douglas Mortimer was hunting El Indio and his gang. He was doing it for both: Justice and Revenge, while Monco just wanted to get money and become rich, but he changed his mind after he saw how Indio is evil and cruel person. The gun fight between Col. Douglas Mortimer and Juan Wild - The Hunchback ( Klaus Kinski) in the bar was fantastic! How Col. Douglas Mortimer killed him. I love this film to death I love it! Sergio Leone did a fantastic job directing this awesome flick in fact I think it is his masterpiece. The film that changed the western movies today and I love the music score from Ennio Morricone. The dialogue and the script was amazing, the weapons used in this film are awesome and they are used well. Action is plenty in the film.What else do you want in an spaghetti Western film like this at all?! The fact is this is the greatest western ever made in the history. I love this film to death!

Like the previous film, I believe Director Sergio Leone gave us a very adventurous film with unpredictable moments that captures your interest. It is fun to watch Eastwood and Van Cleef's methods of operation as they try to bring down the notorious gang; the ambiguous personal backgrounds of Eastwood and Van Cleef's characters add onto the suspense of the story.However, I just the pacing of the story was a little slow at times, as they were a lot of all talk and less action in the packed, two-hour movie.

I like Sergio Leone movies for the same reasons i liked \"For a Few Dollars More\". They are specifically performed (you won't find this acting in \"Unforgiven\" for example), the set design is always something to look at - there are many details in the backgrounds which helps to create this real place and time and transport you to it. Cinematography is gorgeous. The music is always good, adventurous. The gunfights are OK, these movies again are not \"Unforgiven\" type gritty reality, they are \"fun Westerns\" and i like when they for example can shoot the very cigar- end with a revolver - a trick which in reality probably would end up with dudes half of face being blown up.

On the trail of the diabolical El Indio, a most wanted fugitive, our hero crosses paths with Colonel Douglas Mortimer. Mortimer is also after El Indio. After some manly posturing in which The Man with No Name and Mortimer shoot each other's hats the two decide to team up to go after El Indio and his gang. El Indio is currently targeting the Bank of El Paso, supposedly an impenetrable institution in which there is a safe containing almost a million dollars. The pair of bounty hunters plan to infiltrate the gang before the robbery and, if all goes according to plan, take down El Indio with ease. Of course, when does anything ever go according to plan? There will inevitably be complications. And when there are complications in a Western that can only mean one thing. Shootouts. Lots and lots of shootouts.The movie has a simple but reasonably engaging story with a few interesting characters. But the movie really fails to spark to life. The pacing is laborious, there are way too many times in this movie where absolutely nothing of any importance is happening. And even the shootouts, where you would expect the movie to shine, get dragged out to the point interest starts to wane. Once again Clint Eastwood does a fine job playing the ever-stoic Man with No Name. Lee Van Cleef brings a little much-needed personality to the role of Mortimer. And Gian Maria Volont\u00e9 certainly makes for a convincingly detestable villain as El Indio. But despite the credible performances of the three main players the movie still disappoints. The rest of the cast makes very little impact, El Indio's mostly faceless gang making little impression. There's not enough going on with the story to really grab you. A couple of bounty hunters go after a bad guy. Some people shoot at each other now and again. That's about it. The movie ultimately tries to introduce some different motivation for why some of the characters do the things they do. But by then it's too late, you're really just waiting for the movie to end by that point. With some tighter pacing, some sharper action, this could have been a movie which really worked.

Initially, both men work separately picking up reasonable bounties for reasonably notorious criminals. However, when both men discover that there is a $10,000 reward for capturing notorious outlaw El Indio, they both set to work in tracking him down.I think the Dollars Trilogy is probably the only Trilogy I've ever watched where the films have gradually improved as they've progressed. The first film was reasonably good, this second film was very good and the third film was outstanding. I suspect that Leone must have studied each film and looked at ways that he can further improve each of the sequels. I'm clearly not alone in this thought process as the IMDb ratings (at the time of writing this review) for each of the films are 8.1, 8.3 and 9.0 respectively. There isn't a weak film in this trilogy, but as mentioned it's noticeable that there was a steady improvement in quality.For a Few Dollars More has all the trademark qualities that we've come to expect; tension, humour, a good story, interesting characters. I've always felt Leone has his tongue firmly in his cheek when he makes these films and it's clear that he had a lot of fun making this trilogy. Leone also seemed to have a gift for creating tension from the most simple of situations; take the scene where a gang member blows Mortimer's match out and Mortimer just stands there staring at this man. I was sat there thinking what was he going to do? What's going to happen? This scene probably only lasted for a minute and was created out of nothing, but it's effectiveness was remarkable. Likewise, the same could be said for the early scene with Eastwood with the playing cards - a remarkably tense and well executed scene.The part of the film that I was most looking forward to was the inevitable showdown between Eastwood and Van Cleef. I honestly believe that these two guys were amongst the coolest leading men of that era. What made this showdown so brilliant is that it was tense when it needed to be tense and was hysterical when it needed to be funny. I won't spoil what happens in this scene, but let's just say that it won't be what you're expecting. It had me in stitches.Aside from all of the plus points noted above, this film like the first film and the third film in the trilogy also has that wonderful Ennio Morricone score.There really is very little to criticise this film about, but the only negative thing about this film is that I felt that the last 30 minutes was a bit too drawn out. Thankfully, there is enough tension to hold your interest, but the finale went on a bit long in my opinion.

All of those elements make For A Few Dollars More a terrific film and one of my favorite movies that is Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood at their best.For A Few Dollars More tells the story of The Man With No Name(his name is Monco in this film)who is now a bounty hunter who teams up with fellow bounty hunter Colonial Douglas Mortimer(Lee Van Cleef)to take down sadistic outlaw Indio(Gian Maria Volonte)dead or alive.After the Box Office success of A Fistful Of Dollars director Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood were both asked to do a follow up and the two responded with For A Few Dollars More the second film in The Man With No Name/Dollars trilogy and is a brilliant,thrilling and intense Western classic that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the very end and will keep you glued to the screen. Sergio Leone was given a much larger budget with than the one in Fistful and it truly shows because with For A Few Dollars More Leone expands the scope of Fistful and gives this movie a bigger and much larger canvas that is gripping and incredible with an epic style that is operatic. Where as Fistful was inspired by Akira Kurosawa's Youjimbo Leone For A Few Dollars More comes up with his own story and does it in a flawless and stylish way that is pretty amazing. With each of The Man With No Name/Dollars movies Leone's style grew and led all the way up to his masterpiece The Good,The Bad And The Ugly where Leone took the trilogy to a higher level. If A Fistful Of Dollars was about the war between two rival families then For A Few Dollars More about how life and death has a price and outlaws were brutal and vicious with violence being the only option and Leone gives us a stylish yet gritty look at the Old West. What makes FFDM so great and interesting is the teaming of The Man With No Name(Monco)with Mortimer because we see both of them are good bounty hunters by themselves but together they make a lethal combination and both want to capture Indio but for different reasons. Monco wants to capture Indio for the money where as Mortimer wants Indio for the money and personal reasons which makes Mortimer a strong and complex character. Monco and Mortimer like any duo that teams up together have clashes because both either want to do their own thing or it's because of their different personalities but the two start to respect each other. You will enjoy the relationship between the tough and gritty character Monco and Mortimer. Where as Monco and Mortimer are charming and likable antiheroes the character Indio who is the villain in the film is a horrible and vicious character who is so evil that he has no chance for redemption or to be good again because when ever kills a person Indio does it with a twisted glee that is disturbing. Every time Indio showed up on screen you feel like no one is safe from his violent wrath and you are rooting for Monco and Mortimer to catch him. Indio is a character you will never forget and is one of the most intense characters you will ever see in a Western film. While FFDM is without a doubt a classic and one of Leone and Eastwood's best the movie is often seen as the weakest film in the trilogy. I guess the reason some people say that is because it's not as groundbreaking as A Fistful Of Dollars or as epic and sprawling like The Good,The Bad And The Ugly or the story is isn't strong. In my opinion the story in FFDM is strong and had enough greatness the keep viewers entertained. The Action and gunfights in FFDM are truly thrilling and are done with white hot tension and suspense that never quits. The ending in For A Few Dollars More is outstanding and a classic finale filled Action,explosive moments and surprises. A terrific ending.The cast is great. Clint Eastwood is excellent once again as The Man With No Name(Monco)with Eastwood commanding the screen. Lee Van Cleef is brilliant as Colonial Douglas Mortimer and has great chemistry with Eastwood. Gian Maria Volonte is amazing and intense as Indio a sadistic outlaw. Mario Brega(Nino),Luigi Pistilli(Groggy)and Klaus Kinski(Juan Wild)give good performances as well.The direction by Sergio Leone is fantastic and stylish with Leone always moving the camera using close-ups,zooms and creative visual style. Amazing direction,Leone.The score by Ennio Morricone is dazzling,haunting and epic and matches the tone of the movie perfectly. Another great score,Morricone.In final word,if you love Sergio Leone,Clint Eastwood,Westerns or films in general,I highly suggest you see For A Few Dollars More,one of the greatest Westerns ever made and an excellent,unforgettable classic that you will watch again and again.

In this film, \"Monco\" played by Clint Eastwood, and Colonel Douglas Mortimer played by Lee Van Cleef are bounty hunters chasing the same bounties, namely one El Indio (The Indian) played by Gian Maria Volonte.As one of the so called \"spaghetti westerns\" I personally feel that it was better in story and context than the previous Fistful of Dollars but not quite as good as The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. In cinematic terms the director utilized parallel cuts at different points in the film when the scene jumps back and forth from Monco to Colonel Mortimer throughout the entire movie. The extreme close-up shots were seen through the entire film as well, such as when El Indio laughs hysterically about some evil deed or another that he perpetrated. This is especially noted early on in the film when they freeze frame on El Indio's face and then the screen darkens into a wanted poster. Leone also uses inside/out editing to his benefit at multiple places within the film. The one that stands out the most is when El Indio and Monco are talking as the camera comes in for a close-up shot. When we fade back out from their faces we are transferred to a totally different location in an establishing shot of the new location at an abandoned adobe town.The use of lighting in the filming of this movie was done quite extraordinarily. The majority of the light seems to be natural lighting as they are outdoors. However, when they are filming their night shots the use of low-key lighting is well worth the effect they are attempting to create. There is one point where Monco's face is so dark that you will swear he has black face paint on (and he may) but as he descends into the light his face is just shadowed. The one effect that I have always enjoyed in Sergio Leone films is the use of music to heighten the scene. It is not like the music used in today's films because there are no accompanying lyrics to help set the mood, just the acoustics. In all three movies in the trilogy this is an apparent trend that sets the bar for all films to emulate.All in all if you enjoy Clint Eastwood films and Italian directors this movie is a must see for you. For a Few Dollars More is not my favorite of the trilogy by any means, but it is interesting to watch for the similarities and changes in Leone's directing style.

Rivals at first, the two bounty killers later decide to join forces to wipe out the gang. Manco is motivated only by the reward, but Colonel Mortimer has more personal reasons.In the months following the monumental success of A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS, the European population were thirsting for more Spaghetti westerns. Sergio Leone was obliged to make a follow up to his first film. Clint returned as the stranger, again turning in a restrained but ruggedly stupendous performance. In his first Spaghetti western, Lee Van Cleef spectacularly portrays Colonel Mortimer. Lee owns the screen in any Spaghetti western that he appears in and it's fair to say that this film belongs to him.Although,the script refuses to elaborate on the Colonel's military past, thus making the character a tad one dimensional. Regardless of this however, he was still the best character in the film and Colonel Mortimer will always be one of my favourite Spaghetti western anti-heroes. I was stunned by his deadly arsenal of weaponry, which includes several long range rifles and pistols. The Colonel's weapon of choice, a mean looking long range Single Action Army pistol, is put to terrific use in the action scenes.Gian Maria Volonte rivals Lee Van Cleef for best performance in the film. His sadistic laugh pierced my eardrums and the fact that his character is half insane gave Volonte's scenes a horrifying edge.The score by Morricone is better than the score of Fistful. The film's gritty tone is poignantly evoked by the magnificent title song. The \"Eye for an Eye\" piece impressively sets the tone for the tense final showdown.FAFDM is masterfully scripted with every scene skilfully penned and crammed with sturdy dialogue. There's a welcome pinch of humour added to the script with a couple of scenes prompting a slight chuckle. I did find that the film became a little convoluted in it's second half, but this was only a minor flaw that did not affect the film as a whole. The chemistry between Colonel Mortimer and Manco created a superb atmosphere. The scene that takes place in the darkened street and has the two titans having a shooting contest with each other's hats deserves to be relished.In FAFDM,Leone focuses mostly on suspense,excellently building tension throughout the film,especially in the action sequences.Most of the action in this film comprises of ritualistic duels.These duels are made all the more gripping as the characters ready themselves to the tune of a musical watch, before drawing their guns and shooting as the tune ends. The first duel in which El Indio forces an unfortunate character into one such ill fated showdown(after ordering the man's wife and baby killed)had me uneasily piercing my fingers with my teeth. In my opinion, accompanied by the jarring soundtrack, the climatic face off between Colonel Mortimer and El Indio was the most finger biting, nerve wracking and taut showdown in the entire film. Leone had already tightened the tension into a robust knot, for example with the scene near the beginning of the film in which Colonel Mortimer guns down an outlaw in the street. Sergio had then pulled this knot much tighter for the duel between the Colonel and Klaus Kinski's hunchback. The stunts were awesome, with the action sequences packing some highly impressive kills. The jail break scene was exciting and the bank robbery really had me on the edge of my seat. The final shootout which precedes the aforementioned climatic showdown has Colonel Mortimer and Manco going head to head with El Indio's gang. This sequence was immensely exhilarating. A few chilling flashbacks provide Colonel Mortimer with the motive for wanting to kill El Indio and gave the film greater bite.FAFDM is the grittiest film in the Dollars trilogy. It's grittiness will leave a lasting bitter aftertaste and the flashbacks in particular leave a queasy feeling in the stomach. Despite a few small flaws, like the film's length and it dragging a little at points, Leone still excellently surpasses his previous effort. He continued to blaze a searing new trail in the western genre, a trail that would blaze even more fiercely with the release of the final film in the trilogy, THE GOOD,THE BAD AND THE UGLY.10/10.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 4}, "heading": "\"When two hunters go after the same prey,they usually end up shooting each other in the back\"", "date": "2014-08-25T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3075391"}, {"content": "That famous \"hat duel\" scene in \"For a Few Dollars More\" is one of my favorites in a Sergio Leone movie, and it's emblematic of the film's tone: dangerous and a lotta fun.

Starring Clint Eastwood as a bounty hunter looking for a number of wanted suspects, who later partners with another bounty hunter looking for the same guys & make a deal of splitting the reward but in the end when it comes down to final showdown, one of them shows their real motive behind the hunt.Featuring an improved direction from Sergio Leone, For A Few Dollars More presents the director in more control of his artistry & has a much stronger script to muster ahead with. The scope of camera-work, the precision of editing & overall production design also get their upgrades plus the performances from the recurring cast turn out to be better than the previous film with Clint Eastwood & new addition of Lee Van Cleef impressing the most.On an overall scale, For A Few Dollars More is another huge step towards placing the coffin on traditional westerns & presents a significant evolution of every single aspect of its making when compared with A Fistful of Dollars. Ennio Morricone's music also leaves a bigger mark than before & it's exciting to observe how seamlessly it accompanies the drama.

(The music's almost a major character in this film, in fact.) Stylistically iconic, this Sergio Leone opus has an endlessly fascinating and spellbinding story that surprises to the end. Plus, we really come to like the co-heroes, Van Cleef and Eastwood - we want to befriend them and emulate them. Volonte was priceless as a demonic villain - his facial expressions rich with narcissism and a strange kind of violence-fueled euphoria no one else has ever matched in film history, for my money. Though he clashed with director Leone and purportedly did not like the Western genre, Volonte's performance rises above the film's genre and could be favorably compared to the best portrayed villains of other more mainstream movies. Volonte brought a realism to his character and an intensity you don't see in many films. But so did Van Cleef, whose work in this film is incredible. You'd have thought other movie makers would have rushed to cast Van Cleef in important roles after this film, but no. Very strange. Though some might question the wanton violence in this film, the truth is that the real wild west was even more violent and the violence often much more capricious and random. Like all great artistic works, this film never grows old for me.

Leone uses the brilliant Ennio Morricone music to demonstrate the emotions of the characters, and the situations that they find themselves in.Fresh from the successful film A Fistful Of Dollars, Clint Eastwood stars again as the Man With No Name, a man who is identified by this spaghetti poncho and his fast drawing gun action. As the title card states \"Death Sometimes Had Its Price, That Is Why The Bounty Killers Appeared\" basically describes the motives of Clint Eastwood's character, he is a bounty killer that goes up against criminals that have a price on their head.However like anything in life there is competition, for Eastwood it comes in the form of a quiet, intelligent and efficient killer Col Douglas Mortimer played brilliantly by Lee Van Cliff. Mortimer is driven by a deeper motive, one that goes beyond reward money and goes closer to his heart. Lee outshines Eastwood in most of the scenes with his efficient killing style, and his vast array of weaponry.Eventually both men collide as a villainous and psychotic man El Indio escapes from prison, and plans with the help of his ruthless gang to rob the bank of El Paso. Gian Maria Volonte plays Indio with such perfection and realism, and gives the viewers a much more in-depth look into his character. As viewers we sense that Indio is a disturbed man, with a long past that has made him psychotic and ultimately evil. It was enjoyable to see Volonte have a wider role as the villain, as in the previous film A Fistful of Dollars his villain Ramon Rojo didn't really go into second gear. As the film progresses Eastwood and Lee's characters realise that they must form a partnership in order to bring down Indio and his gang of killers, both for different reasons.For A Few Dollars More is one of the best westerns ever made with its greatly orchestrated gun duels assisted by this breath taking soundtrack, making it a must see western.

Sergio Leone began to make the \"sequel\" with the same cast of his predecessor, bigger, but with small errors it doesn't surpasses its predecessor, but continued epic and Badass!\"For a few dollars more\", begins with the cruel criminal El Indio (Gian Maria Volont\u00e9) escaping from a Mexican prison with the help of his gang killing in cold blood all the guards on their way. The news comes fast with wanted posters with his pictures scattered in all American cities. One of the posters captured the attention of Col. Douglas Mortimer, a bounty hunter who soon begins to plan how to get Indio dead or alive. Not only Mortimer, but also caught the attention of Monco (Clint Eastwood), another bounty hunter who also covets the reward for the capture or death of Indio. When both hunters unwittingly meet each other face to face, knowing Indio's plan to rob a bank heavily guarded, they decide to work together to get Indio and share the big reward for Indio and his gang. But Monco discovers that Mortimer objectives go far beyond that to receive the reward, much darker than that.Many consider that this movie is not a sequel, but according to Eastwood it is. The reason for this consideration is mainly Eastwood's character. While in the predecessor he was this mysterious man who called himself Joe, trying to take advantage of a gang war cashing out at the end. And in this one he is a bounty hunter who calls himself \"Monco\" who makes a certain justice catching and killing criminals, those are the differences but the age of time is the same. The first movie was located at the time of the gang warfare on the frontier and the time of the American cavalry, and this one is happening in 1873, the same historical age. And, Joe-Monco in the first one he heard advices from the city's innkeeper saying that one day everyone had to sit in one and honest work, that is exactly what he does this one. Killing bad folks and earning money.The film's problems are few and forgivable, but compared with the 1st movie, it makes a certain lack. I'm talking about the film's narrative, while in the 1st movie she was very well written and flowed perfectly in a superb script. In this one, the 1st hour of the movie almost nobody says something, and we only know most of the story in the remaining hours of the film, now flowing perfectly. And in the first film since the first half hour we were completely coated in history. But this was actually Eastwood's own idea. He liked so much of his character that he starts investing and exploring a lot (the Joe-Monco fur were from Eastwood). And advised Leone to him give less dialog to increase the mystery of his character, and of course, increase our Goosebumps when he talks.But this little problem, paved the way for the magnificent direction of Leone. Not only in the duels scenes, which here are not only better than the 1st movie but are more tense and the direction in each one is simply superb. But the moments that stand out are the fantastic Italian and Spanish landscapes serving as the American Old West.And the performances simply excellent: Clint Eastwood.....do I need to say something?; Gian Maria Volonte who was almost the same role in the 1st movie, the good shooting and cruel villain, but thanks to his exuberant performance it lends an air of a psychopathic villain; Lee Van Cleef superb. Leone's idea of putting two Badasses shooters is a experiencing that at the time of the film no one had ever seen it, jaws went straight to the floor and the chills came by every word. And the duel between the two, it was advanced for the time, is not a duel with both shooting each other, but each one testing the skills of each other.This movie is one of those sequels that are only one step behind the predecessor. But thanks to the genius of Leone in both direction and screenplay, and the exuberant performances, \"For a few dollars more\" remains an excellent continuation and an important part in the masterpiece trilogy.10/10", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 3}, "heading": "One of those sequels that stays one step behind its predecessor, but it still freaking EPIC!", "date": "2013-10-05T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2881513"}, {"content": "Sergio Leone's sophomore film in his Spaghetti Western trilogy and is a major step up from A Fistful of Dollars. This was a film that didn't appeal to me, the first time I have watched it but as I watch it more and more along with others within the trilogy, I start to see the great things about this film. For A Few Dollars More is much more bigger and a much more better written film than it's predecessor.For A Few Dollars More was written by both Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni. Both have written a story that is engaging and this is due to a plot with much bigger stakes, and rewards, and also much better written characters. This film fleshes out the characters much more than it's predecessors, taking it's time to show each person's agenda and their personalities, yet Leone and Vincenzoni still has kept the unpredictability that was found in the first film. Oddly enough, even though Eastwood's character is the main star, the film's emotional significance was much more apparent on Mortimer and El Indio. Their back story is the reason that I care about these characters, it tells us why they are who they are. For A Few Dollars More's script has it's humor pumped up in comparison to the first film and I felt that this work. It actually gives the film much more character and helps not make the tone of the film too negative.Sergio Leone has created a film that is much more cinematic and traditional in comparison to the first film but at the same time not trading off the uniqueness of the first film, which was the slow building tension and the close ups of people's faces focusing on their reactions and the emotional facial acting by the actors. This film does increase the beat of the film, with editing that moves the film along at a pace that keeps us on our toes. Leone has definitely have gained much more confidence going towards this film as the film doesn't feel as indulgent as the first and seemed to show much more enjoyment with the story than the first film. This film's budget was much higher than the first film which allowed him to create settings that feel real and lively.Massimo Dallamano is back as the cinematographer of this film. The film looks much better than the first film and this may be due to the increase in budget and shot at better locations or it could be due to Dallamano and Leone has a much better understanding of what they want for this film. The film still retains that style from the first film with close ups that take it's time to move things along but it's much more improved here as they have used different angles and techniques in constructing these shots, allowing them to feel fresh. Dallamano has the camera move in this film much more than the first. The first film has it's shots set up in a way that doesn't require the camera to move or zoom into anything. This movement makes the film move faster and exciting.Ennio Morricone comes back to do the score for this film and it's just as great as the first one. The score here sounds much more fuller and dramatic, this may be due to a much larger story and much more characters focused on. Morricone's score here may not be as memorable as the first or third film but it definitely fits with what is shown on screen and it doesn't feel recycled. The film's score feels fast and upbeat, which sound great in moments of the film that have characters riding their horses on the beautiful backdrops. Morricone also has a much lighter and smaller track that plays during the build up of climax, the music that comes from the lockets. It sounds beautiful and it connects with the emotional weight during these situations.The film's cast is much bigger in this film and the film is now shared with three characters rather than a main focus on Eastwood. Clint Eastwood is great here as expected but not as memorable as A Fistful of Dollars. Lee Van Cleef brings something different to the film which gives the film much more personality. Leone loves to have actors banter in his films and it's definitely apparent here with the focus on the friendship on both Eastwood and Cleef's characters. Both actors work well together and it's a shame that this isn't the case for the next film. Gian Maria Volonte is back for this film as the antagonist, this time his character is much better written and his acting is much more effective but it may not appeal to everyone as he has increased the dramatics in this film in comparison to the first film.For A Few Dollars More is a much better constructed film than A Fistful of Dollars with a bigger and better story and improvements on the acting and photography. The film is great to watch on its own and does not require to watch the first or third film to understand but if you have seen the other films you get to pick up on the small things that Leone has put in this film.", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 6, "votes": 8}, "heading": "Bigger and Better", "date": "2013-10-01T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2878882"}, {"content": "Col.

We never learn much him, but that doesn't stop us admiring his quick hands.For A Few Dollars More also uses the same iconic soundtrack as its predecessor and, while its whistling can become irritating, it is one of the key driving forces behind the film as the camera flicks between characters during the agonising stand-off.Personally, I prefer this film to its predecessor.

The film was released in the United States in 1967 and is the second part of what is commonly known as the Dollars Trilogy.Summary: Eastwood (as the Man with No Name) and Van Cleef (as Colonel Douglas Mortimer and the \"Man in Black\") portray two bounty hunters in pursuit of \"El Indio\" (Gian Maria Volont\u00e9), one of the most wanted fugitives in the western territories, and his gang. Indio is a ruthless, intelligent man. He has a musical pocket watch that he plays before engaging in gun duels. \"When the chimes finish, begin,\" he says. Flashbacks reveal that the watch originates from a young woman (Rosemary Dexter), who killed herself while being raped by Indio after he had found her with her lover (in Joe Millard's novelization of the film, the young man is her newly-wed husband) and killed him. The watch bears a photo of the woman and was presented as a gift by the young man before being killed. Colonel Mortimer (Cleef) illegally stops a train in Tucumcari, and soon after collects a bounty of $1,000 on Guy Calloway (Jos\u00e9 Terr\u00f3n). Mortimer's gun slinging skill is displayed as he easily kills him from long distance. After collecting the bounty, he inquires about Red \"Baby\" Cavanagh (Jos\u00e9 Marco), who has a $2,000 bounty, and was last seen in White Rocks. Mortimer is told that Cavanagh has already been targeted by Eastwood's character, who is referred to as \"Manco\" (meaning one-armed in Spanish \u2014 see below for an explanation). We see Manco ride into town and track down Cavanagh at a saloon playing five-card draw poker. Manco kills him and his men, and takes the bounty. Eventually, the two bounty hunters, after learning about each other from different sources, meet in El Paso and, after butting heads, decide to team up to take down Indio and his gang.Questions: What was so important about the bank in El Paso? Who was offered a membership? What was the membership to? Who recognizes the Colonel? Who is the Colonel? Where did the Colonel come from? Who was the Colonel's right hand man? What was Indio up to? Does anyone figure out what Indio was up to? My Thoughts: I like western films and I like Clint Eastwood films. However, this one was a waste of time!

This is director Sergio Leone,s true masterpiece of the trilogy. More stylish and ambitious than the first,but not as overlong or pretentious as the third.It,s the greatest spaghetti western ever made.Clint Eastwood,s second performance as The Man with No Name sees him team up with ageing gunslinger Lee Van Cleef to bring down psychotic Gian Maria Volonte (one of cinema,s most evil villains) and his gang. The plot is cynical and brilliant,the stark imagery is perfect and Ennio Morricone,s score is my favourite.What always surprised me about Good/Bad/Ugly was how underwritten Eastwood and Van Cleef,s parts were.Basically the film was about Tuco.But in this film,Leone actually seems equally interested in all three of the main characters and brilliantly fleshes them out.Eastwood was always meant to be quiet and mysterious,but in this,you get a sense of his personality and purpose,unlike the third,where he came across a bit bored,which he probably was by that time. And Van Cleef was a great addition to the film.Although I,m not usually a fan of his,he was great here in his most sympathetic role as the haunted army veteran. Together the two formed one of cinema,s greatest partnerships.Their stony eyed double act is a joy throughout,especially in the sequence where they shoot at each other,s hats in the street. Leone even put some thought into Volonte,s role.As Indio,he is not a cardboard villain.He is sadistic,psychotic,treacherous to his own men and (dare I say it)even almost human in sequences where he flashes back to a despicable act he,s committed.The first 30 minutes of the film are riveting,showing the main characters in unrelated incidents before the strands twists together for the main story,which is never short of suspenseful,involving and enjoyable.It combines black humour,melancholic moments and great shootouts that all build up to an unforgettable climax and tops off my favourite Leone film.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 3}, "heading": "The most underrated but the best", "date": "2012-06-27T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2633746"}, {"content": "From its playful opening credits sequence to its modernistic end, For A Few Dollars More is entertaining and well made, in almost all aspects, and its subversion of Western conventions is so complete that one might call it a Western in name only; it's more of a buddy or caper film.

I really feel that \"A Fistful of Dollars\", the first opus of Sergio Leone's Dollars Dollars trilogy owes to \"Yojinbo\" just as much as Francis Ford Coppola's \"The Godfather\" owes to Mario Puzo's novel. The creations that inspired the directors were significant, but not necessarily superior. I enjoy \"A Fistful of Dollars\" more than \"Yojinbo\" because Akira Kurosawa's film already had a Western feel that made the story stylishly awkward and let's face it, \"The Godfather\" as a novel, is not for literature what the film is for Cinema.Now, let me go further with my game of correspondences, \"For a Few Dollars More\", in my opinion, is for \"A Fistful of Dollars\" what \"The Godfather Part II\" is for \"The Godfather\", not by its status as a sequel or second installment but in the way it demonstrates Sergio Leone's capability to make an original film out of a material that didn't belong to him at first. Like Coppola who wrote an original plot involving characters he didn't create, Leone was able to take the same material of the first movie to make a truly original film and a beautiful continuation of the Man-With-No-Name's adventure. Call it inspiration or adaptation, the film is the proof that \"A Fistful of Dollars\"' greatness didn't only rely on the fact that it was the remake of a foreign ingenuous script; it's the work of a talented director, that stands alone as a classic. And the confirmation came one year later with \"A Few Dollars More\", a major Western film that elevates Leone's status as a unique filmmaker and probably the most stylish and entertaining director of Westerns.The film opens with the opening statement : \"Where life had no value, death, sometimes, had its price. That is why the bounty killers appeared\" The film opens with the shooting of a man on his horse while the opening credits are conducted by Ennio Morricone's haunting score, maybe not the best, but this is not saying much when compared to \"A Fistful of Dollars\", \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" or \"Once Upon a Time in the West\". The film is about two bounty hunters, Lee Van Cleef as Colonel Douglas Mortimer and Clint Eastwood as Manco, \"the one-armed man\" is a nickname due to his facility to use only one arm for shooting. Both are fast guns and professional bounty hunters, not the safest job but certainly the most profitable for as long as there would be criminals, there would be bounty hunters. Bounty hunters are as valuable for the Old West's society as buzzards and coyotes for the ecosystem. Like \"A Fistful of Dollars\" (and \"Yojinbo\"), the protagonists are not the most moral characters in the world.Only, this time, the distinction between heroes and villains is clearer since the targets of the bounty hunters are criminals wanted dead or alive, which puts reasonable limitations on our level of empathy toward them. But again, the question is not to discuss the morality of this or that character, \"For a Few Dollars More\" invites us to follow a group of men, whose fates meet in a tale of revenge, vengeance, greed and strategy, surrounding three distinct figures. And beyond the coolness of Manco, the authority of Colonel Mortimer and the vileness of El Indio, the most hunted fugitive in the West, played by Gian Maria Volonte, they all share a common quality: they're domineering, intelligent and with a remarkable capacity to anticipate the moves of the adversaries. The plot evolves with a chess game precision. that reminded me of Kurosawa's \"Sanjuro\" And the chess game metaphor is even more eloquent when Manco and Colonel decides to team up and El Indio sacrifices some men to get away from them.And all through the film, it's impossible to determine who's the cleverest of the trio, each one has a moment to shine, and the film does a great job, developing the schemes of the three characters, from the bank robberies, to the way to get the safe from the bank of El Paso, and then to keep the loot, and share it with the team ... the film clearly points out that it's easy to steal money and difficult to keep it, it goes to subtle details where everything, every single action is guided by a desire to have 'a few dollars more', El Indio can have more money if he gets rid of some men, Manco and Colonel can have more of Indio's men if they team up, which means more money, or less, it depends. Greed acts like a double-edged sword and is obviously the most redoubtable enemy of each character.But beyond these philosophical undertones, the film proves to have much more depth than many Westerns, featuring a great set of spectacular scenes, carried by wonderful performances from Gian Maria Volonte, Lee Van Cleef, and Clint Eastwood and a honorable mention for Kinski as Wild, the hunchback. Cinema is missing such faces \u0085 \"For a Few Dollars More\" is full of so many memorable moments, probably the most defining being the pocket watch with the penetrating carillon music and Indio's unforgettable \"When the chimes end, pick up your gun\" The film is full of Leone's archetypes that became trademarks of the Western Spaghetti, with long close-ups on ugly, sweaty and greasy faces, and this beautiful profile shot where a face beautifully completes the landscape. Again, Leone provides a masterpiece of over-direction that elevates the most ordinary story to epic proportions, until an operatic and mind-blowing showdown.\"A Fistful of Dollars\" was Leone making his entrance among the great directors, and \"For a Few Dollars More\" cemented the legend, and the best was still to come", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "How far would one go ... for a few dollars more?...", "date": "2012-04-13T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2596123"}, {"content": "I enjoyed the swagger of A Fistful of Dollars, but had some reservations about the quality of its script. This second installment in the \"Dollars Trilogy\" thematic series had all the swagger of Fistful, including awesome music and sick camera work, but also improved in the quality of script. It seemed that this story was more thought out, including plot twists and better character development, whereas Fistful's story appeared to be put in place merely to set up cool tag lines and posturing between Eastwood and Volont\u00e9. There was pretty heavy action in this second film, too: the total kill count was 30.Eastwood continued to show the world why he would eventually be regarded as one of the baddest mofos to ever grace the silver screen. Volont\u00e9 was crazier and more ruthless in this film than he was in the first, and I loved it! Last but not least, Van Cleef may have stolen the show as the man in black, veteran bounty hunter Col. Douglas Mortimer\u0085it wasn't clear who the bigger badass was. In fact, Van Cleef claimed to be faster on the draw than Eastwood. He only took three frames of film (one eighth of a second) to draw, cock and fire! All in all, this film is a classic, and a great representative of what the spaghetti Western has to offer. About midway through, the pace dramatically slowed to an almost boring pace (although my perception may have been a bit clouded by beer-induced sleepiness), but it soon picked back up again, and the movie ended very strongly. I recommend that you set aside some time to watch this flick at some point, preferably with some alcohol and a friend that enjoys spaghetti Westerns, B movies, or campy films.

Clint Eastwood, called Manco (Portuguese for 'lame-handed'. Italian equivalent would be Monco) This time around, and once again the portrayal of the anti-hero is iconic. However, even he meets his match with Lee Van Cleef, playing Colonel Douglas Mortimer. I know fans probably debate this all the time, but it was clearly established in that first meet scene that Mortimer is the better shot. Not to undermine Eastwood, after all the two working together produce quite a body count in the usual bad-ass fashion. My favorite Leone villain would undoubtedly be Indio, played masterfully by Gian Maria Volont\u00e9. He's undeniably a killer, a conniving schemer, and yes even a madman perhaps but he's also distraught permanently by what he's done. Or rather one crime in particular, but I won't spoil it.It was my first Spaghetti Western as a matter of fact. I stumbled upon it on TV, right about the scene where Indio extracts revenge on the man who betrayed him. It's quite possibly my favorite scene in the whole movie. The numerous wide-angle shots, the glorious close-ups, and the thrill of Ennio Morricone's score, they all come together to create unrivaled tension. Of all things, an organ plays a tune that could belong to a horror film, but it fits so perfectly. As a boy of eight I was completely mesmerized by the scene.The cinematography is quite well done, always lingering on an object to add dimension or meaning. Note how when Eastwood's character stares at the wanted poster for Indio, his eyes linger on the money. When Mortimer looks at the same poster, the camera cuts back and forth between his eyes and that piece of paper, the sound of gunshots add to the scene awesomely. Cleverly, Leone is building up that there's more than money driving Cleef's character. And of course the sets are awesome, and for being filmed in Europe, one would never guess that it's anything but the American West itself. The film boasts incredible cinematography, a thrilling score and bad-ass characters.

Utilizing many of the same cast members, Leone's follow up is more layered and stylised than before. It was the most successful Italian film of its time and remained so into the early 70's. For this reason its probably fair to say that more than any other movie, this was the definitive template of the Spaghetti Western genre. Its story of mean bad guys and mean good guys entwined in a revenge plot was mimicked several times in other Italian movies. Leone, however, was the master of this sub-genre and in this film he begins to really show why. It's paced magnificently and is consistently visually arresting. It exhibits many of the director's recurring imagery - extreme close-ups, scenes of operatic violence and an eye for interesting faces. But of course, this is only part of the story because what would these films be without the contribution of Ennio Morricone? The soundtrack maestro is once again on peerless form and the score is quite brilliant. It's unthinkable to imagine Leone's films without the contribution of this musical genius. Similarly, the cast add good value. Clint Eastwood is a solid presence but he is overshadowed by Lee Van Cleef as Colonel Douglas Mortimer \u2013 despite being top billed Eastwood often essentially played second fiddle to his co-star, think also of Eli Wallach in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. The villains are also very good too. Gian Maria Volont\u00e9 is always compelling as the chief psychopath, what with his mixture of physical menace and psychological damage. But perhaps best of all is Klaus Kinski as the unforgettable hunchback bandit. He is criminally under used, however.For a Few Dollars More is not quite up to the standard of Leone's two masterpieces that followed it \u2013 The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West \u2013 but it remains an awesome western nevertheless, and perhaps the best place for a novice to start when first dipping into the joys that constitute the Spaghetti Western genre.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 3}, "heading": "The template Spaghetti Western", "date": "2011-12-29T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2539697"}, {"content": "This movie is like being blind and suddenly getting your sight back. The quality of storytelling is so poor in most films that you almost become inured to it. Then you watch something like For A Few Dollars More and your eyes are reopened to the power and promise of cinema. Yeah, I know that sounds a little pretentious for a Spaghetti Western about bank robbery, bounty killers and familial revenge. When filmmakers can bring this level of skill and vision to an ubermacho cowboy drama, though, it shames all the supposedly more sophisticated work that flounders where this motion picture soars.Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) is an aging gun man who uses his wits and cutting edge Wild West tech to claim the rewards on wanted men. Monco (Clint Eastwood) is a younger gunhand cocky enough to walk into any situation and fast enough on the draw to shoot his way out. These two men decide to team up to bring down the notorious bandit Indio (Gian Maria Volonte) and his gang as they execute a daring bank robbery. The tormented and utterly ruthless Indio proves to be much smarter than they expected, however, and the bounty killers are forced into a desperate battle where Colonel Mortimer reveals a much more personal vendetta at work.The key phrase in movies is \"show, don't tell\" and the three opening sequences that introduce Mortimer, Monco and Indio are about as sterling an example of that as you will ever see. With each man barely speaking, their actions tell the audience everything they are and starkly define the differences that separate them. Moritmer and Monco are introduced trying to collect the rewards on two violent men, but how they do that is definitively different. Moritmer is relentless will and dispassionate intelligence, while Monco is pure balls and lightning reflexes. Indio's introduction finds him taking revenge on a traitor in a way that shows him to be utterly without scruples but with an emotional depth that prevents him from being nothing but an automaton of evil. So many ambitious filmmakers worry so much about what they're going to do with the camera. Sergio Leone shows them here that it's what you do with your characters that matters most.Not that Leone doesn't know what to do with the camera. There are so many great shots and great scenes here that it's hard to decide which is the best. Is it the standoff in the street between Monco and Mortimer? The final climatic shootout? Monco's wagon of corpses? Indio's unforgettable vengeance? Monco's welcoming committee to Agua Caliente? Mortimer unveiling his arsenal as his prey tries to flee? There's such beautiful staging and rhythm to it all.And the music, good grief. The soundtrack isn't quite as all encompassing as Conan the Barbarian (the Arnold original, of course), but For A Few Dollars More is one of the rare movies that can match Conan's score for thrilling intensity and thematic punch. When Indio's revenge explodes into organ music and the final gunfight evolves from delicate chimes to a symphony of anticipation, only someone's whose been dead for three weeks won't feel their heart beat a little harder and their blood pump a little faster.The performances here are also about as fine as you get for this sort of thing. Clint Eastwood is effective but mostly unexceptional. He's played more interesting versions of this same character many times. Gian Maria Volonte is spectacular in all his sweaty, unstable glory. He marvelously projects this tortured, self-destructive drive in Indio to the point where it's never clear if he's defeated by the bounty killers or by himself. And Lee Van Cleef may be the manliest man to ever walk the Earth as Mortimer. His controlled, mature machismo is not just in contrast to the younger, brasher Monco. Mortimer is sort of the last stand of grown up masculinity before it got swallowed up in a flood of adolescent smartassery in cinema.For A Few Dollars More is an absolute must see, and not just among Westerns.

Leone was certainly starting to gain his footing as a director of almost limitless vision and ambition, and the willingness to take risks and try new things with each successive entry into his \"Dollars trilogy.\" He again operates his camera to show the dry, oppressive desert-scape of the Old West as a place of murderous violence and not much respect for human life. It's a dark and dangerous vision of the Old West that rightfully earns its title as the \"Wild West\"; it would be a long time before Hollywood would get the idea that the western genre was changing, and Sam Peckinpah's landmark bloodbath \"The Wild Bunch\" debuted in 1969 to challenge traditional movie standards of what can and can't be shown on the big screen.\"For a Few Dollars More\" was followed by a third film, \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" (1967), which brought Leone's landmark \"Dollars trilogy\" to an epic closer.

For those of you that do not know what a spaghetti western is, let me explain.Spaghetti Western, also known as Italo-Western, is a nickname for a broad sub-genre of Western films that emerged in the mid-1960s in the wake of Sergio Leone's unique and much copied film-making style and international box-office success, so named by American critics because most were produced and directed by Italians. The correct term for these films, in Italy, is western all'italiana (Italian-Style Western); British critics tended to use the label Continental Western to describe these films, and the phrase 'Spaghetti Western' was originally created by American critics as a derogatory name for this group of films but has over time become accepted by fans of the films. The language in which the movies were originally released was Italian as well, but as most of the films featured multilingual casts and sound was invariably post-synched, most Westerns all'Italiana do not have an official dominant language.Over to the film. The best actor here is Lee Von Cleef. Cleef played the villain in another legendary western directed by Leone: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly (1966). Here he's the good guy.Shoulder to shoulder to him is Gian Maria Volont\u00e9. And if you think about it he always is the iconic villain in Leone's films. The next in line is Clint Eastwood who supports Cleef well. Clint is a household name worldwide so I need not elaborate on him.Plot: Colonel Mortimer (Cleef) illegally stops a train in Tucumcari, and soon after collects a bounty of $1,000 on Guy Calloway (Jos\u00e9 Terr\u00f3n). Mortimer's gunslinging skill is displayed as he easily kills him from long distance. After collecting the bounty he inquires about Red \"Baby\" Cavanagh (Jos\u00e9 Marco), who has a $2,000 bounty, and was last seen in White Rocks. Mortimer is told that Cavanagh has already been targeted by Eastwood's character, who is referred to as \"Manco\".We see Manco ride into town and track down Cavanagh at a saloon playing five-card draw poker. Manco kills him and his men, and takes the bounty. Eventually, the two bounty hunters, after learning about each other from different sources, meet in El Paso and, after butting heads, decide to team up to take down El Indio, one of the most wanted fugitives in the western territories, and his gang.Meanwhile, Indio's men free him from prison where he was held. After hies release, Indio's primary goal is to rob the Bank of El Paso and its disguised safe containing \"almost a million dollars.\" Mortimer persuades a reluctant Manco to join Indio's gang during the robbery in order to \"get him between two fires.\" Manco is offered membership in the gang after rescuing one of Indio's friends from prison.What are Mortimer's reasons for pursuing Indio? Will he and Manco overcome Indio and his gang? Watch and find out! Verdict: Buy it on VCD/DVD/BLURAY!

But he also has to deal with a rival bounty hunter that is on the trail for the same bounty. And I must say Lee Van Cleef makes a pretty good rival. Anyways there is more to this story as it progresses just when you feel like you got down the main plot of this movie. This is a spaghetti western with some good storytelling and a entertaining one that will inspire other future movies to come. It's a old western that even the modern audiences can still enjoy and have a good time with, especially when it comes to audiences that enjoy western movies. Even most of the characters are interesting or adds something to this film. This movie is what true western is all about and yet it isn't dry but also entertaining. The gunfights are also one of the most awesome western gunfights in a film.8.5/10", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "The iconic western gunslinger is back", "date": "2011-10-07T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2499752"}, {"content": "Sergio Lenoe's 'Man With No Man' trilogy is probably the only film series in history that only got better from one to the next; 'For a Few Dollars More' is better than 'A Fistful of Dollars', but not as great as the classic third installment.

I mean, here I am riding in a car with a professor, educated at Columbia and Harvard, from a distinguished family, brother-in-law to a former Secretary of State, and he's carrying on about the talent of Sergio Leone, making me feel like a proletarian dummy, the kind of guy who says things like, \"I don't know anything about art but I know what I like.\" I thought \"A Fistful of Dollars\" was ludicrous, \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" mistakenly made a bad man out of President Henry Fonda, and \"Once Upon a Time in America\" dealt with Jewish gangsters who looked mighty Italian to me.There's something else too. Unlike American-made Westerns, the spaghetti Westerns, drenched in atmosphere though they may be, are devoid of any history or any back story at all. Look at \"Shane.\" Cattlemen versus squatters. Or \"The Wild Bunch.\" Day of the outlaw draws to a close. But there's none of this in Leone's Westerns. The town is in the middle of nowhere. Nobody has a wife and kids to worry about. There has been no Civil War. There's nothing but moral nihilism. It's completely abstract in all of its elements.I wasn't able to get all the way through \"For A Few Dollars More\" but, to tell the truth, it wasn't as painful as I'd expected. I nodded out, not because of the movie but because of the demands of my reticular activating system.The story was ritualized junk, to be sure, and the titles seem to have been done by a high school kid for a class in graphics, but -- I don't know -- in the opening scenes Lee Van Cleef's face in close up is the color of teak and has a fine sheen to it, as of a thin coat of lard. In these swarthy faces teeth seem to glow in the dark.Van Cleef is a cool bounty hunter and shoots bad guys for a living. Clint Eastwood is a bounty hunter too but of a different stripe. Where Van Cleef is dressed in an estimable suit and cape of black, riding a horse of the same color, like an undertaker, Eastwood is raggedy in his poncho. They both shoot and kill like lightning. And they're both after the same no-goodnik, Gian Maria Volonte.Volonte is Italian, not Mexican, and his voice is dubbed by an American, but that doesn't matter because everybody's voice was dubbed in later and, except for Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Kinski, all the actors seem to be Italian too. All the sounds are foleyed in -- the PTEW gun shots, the crunch of gravel beneath the silver-spurred black boot, the sharp clatter of horse hooves on wooden planks. Ennio Morricone, who could write good music, must have chuckled as he scored the whistling theme here.Anyway, I was sort of getting into it but finally felt myself nodding out and went to bed instead. I imagine Volonte wound up a corpse, among so many corpses, and that there was some sort of confrontation between the impeccable Van Cleef and the peccable Eastwood.

This time, Clint teams up with Lee Van Cleef to take down some bandits and get rich. It's a simple story, but it works. Unfortunately, it doesn't all work. I'm sure it saved a lot of money, but you can't cast the same guy to play the same role in an \"unrelated\" movie. (I'm talking about the bad guy). After the end of Fistful, I spent the first half of this movie trying to figure out what the film's relations are. It's too confusing, especially when the characters are so similar.The next problem are the other characters. In Fistful, it was Clint versus the town, alone with only his wits and his gun. In Halo 2, I mean Few Dollars More, we have two badasses to root for. Unfortunately, in my opinion this lessens both of their likability, especially since it seems there's less shooting in this than Fistful, but that comes later. Both characters are well acted though, and Van Cleef's revolver is a monster. Also, the 'psychopathic' Indio isn't that crazy compared to other movie villains, and he only starts to show his craziness halfway through the film. Again, I complain about his casting choice and lack of effort to differentiate him from Fistful's Rojo.Lastly, the film's pacing is not good and it runs too long. Whereas Fistful starts with a tense stand off and maintained an active pace, Few Dollars More starts off far too slow and picks up too late. Once the robbery happened, I was engaged for the rest of the film, but it took too long to get there for a spaghetti western. The film, 2 hours 10 minutes long, could've had 10-15 minutes cut and still told the same story with the same amount of action.Few Dollars More is still a fun western, with good leads and a strong second half.

The films get progressively better, with the first a loose remake of something else about a loner wading into a town; beating up the Mexican bandits and then attempting to rescue a damsel, a wonderful film on its own but now more a fascinating example of Leone as he found his directorial feet. Seeing the 'trilogy' as a whole, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a culmination of Leone's sublime ability to work within an established western setting but implement similar plot ideas and a stark, episodic directorial style as he makes every sequence and scene his own as this sordid tale of mostly unpleasant people weaves their way to a bloody, confrontational climax.Like the subsequent 1966 film; For a Few Dollars More sees a lead, supposedly the same in all three, played by Clint Eastwood forge an uneasy alliance with another man as they seek out a grand prize; a prize they could split between them or steal for themselves from the other. The films share more with one another than just the style implemented by the director; here, Eastwood's character Monco teams up with Lee Van Cleef's army Colonol Douglas Mortimer as they chase down a Mexican bandit named El Indio (Volont\u00e9). Both films see these forged partnerships ultimately fighting a ruthless killing machine, a sadistic man whom enjoys the pain he and others inflict on people and nary batters an eyelid in following through with his actions when faced with the idea of cutting a family in two by way of killing some of its members; particularly aiding in having the two central players come across as more favourable than they actually are. The relations the characters share are in binary opposition to its 1966 cousin; there, an American with links to the army was perceived as the chief threat to both Eastwood's character and his ally, a Mexican bandit he teams up with named Tuco. Here, the bandit is the enemy and the army personnel the ally. One thing remains, that each of the two films are breathtaking in their imagery and direction as they weave a dramatic and involving path, leading us through a hostile perception of the old west to a form of satisfying closure effortlessly tying up various strands.We begin with a straight comparison between the pairing which will come top forge the path the film's story will take. Van Cleef, clad in black and with that ominous expression, sits on a train and gets off at a station of his choice after illegally activating the emergency stop. People he interacts with seem scared on him, a barking train guard stopping dead in his tracks when he sees it's Colonol Mortimer leading his horse off the train and into town. He's a bounty hunter, and goes after a criminal who is wanted by the law; this bandit occupies the same area his wanted posters litter, suggesting an overly confident; unhinged, almost sociopathic, persona-come-attitude in that he's in such close proximity to the zone he's wanted by the local law. When the Colonol, carrying an array of rifles and guns we feel he cannot wait to use, takes him on and beats him with relative ease the ability and temperament of the man is finely established. On another strand is Monco who's also a bounty hunter, his chosen target is playing cards in a tavern and a methodical approach from the man sees him breeze in up to the game and engage in a cheeky card turning trick which provokes his target; Monco only turning when provoked to murderous brute force in which degrees of hard bodiedness are required.The two of them share an uneasy relationship, initially. A scene in a room the two of them occupy sees each of the men uneasily shift around discussing their alliance, each of them swapping positions of being seated as the other looms over them whilst still standing; suggesting a state of oneupmanship in which both are evenly matched and exchanging positions of power. Eventually, they seem to share some common ground through dialogue and both of them seat themselves down opposite one another suggesting a now agreed relationship. Leone highlights this in a physical sense with an surreal hat shooting contest, something perhaps not entirely necessarily given what plays out in the aforementioned scene. The gun-toting, gang sporting, child harming, family killing Mexican terrorist named El Indio is their target; someone with a bounty on their head's after having been broken out of jail by his gang early on, whom then all take refuge in a church so as to lay low and plan a bank heist. The locale of the church and Leone's placing of El Indio at one point in a pulpit suggests a sense of hierarchy within his own circles, with an additional a sense of them following him as he leads the sermon.Leone's ability to provide us with Mortimer and paint an image of him through other people's reactions and his own interactions with things around him before bringing it all round and humanising him with a back story is wonderful. One other sequence greatly subscribes to a certain theory pioneered by Hitchcock, about men sitting at a table with a bomb underneath it; in that a wall of a bank set to blow is teasingly shot with an array of long-shots of the building, close ups of an unsuspecting guard inside and face of the bounty hunters, all accompanied with distorted and uncharacteristic sound effects and music as we are denied what is expected to happen.

However at first it wasn't the case, as I did prefer the sweeping milestone \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" and the pioneering \"A Fistful of Dollars\"\u0085 but over time from the first time I saw it (and it was the first one I saw of the three) until now I've really grown fond of the follow-up to put it up there above the rest.A squinting Clint Eastwood would return to his trademark role that got him noticed as the lone bounty hunter with the poncho and chewed up cigar \"The man with no name\" -- although he's known as Monco here, along with Gian Maria Volonte in another principle villain roll Indio -- a dope smoking, but venomous bandit with a cackling laugh. Joining them is bad-ass actor Lee Van Cleef as an opposing bounty hunter Colonel Mortimer with a hidden agenda. Van Cleef emit's a steely mood, which works off Eastwood's laconic presence that's even more inscrutable. Both want Indio --- who'll get him first and that means eliminating each other for that prize. So they come to the option of teaming up to see Indio and his outlaws' dead or alive. Leone really does focus on the impetuously odd relationship that forms between these two central characters and the dialogues exchanged (while quite sparse and to the point) shows the growing admiration in what they can see they're quite alike. So when Volonte's flamboyant character finally comes to the party and the three separate paths come to one. It does make for one memorable climax with Ennio Morricone's musical score packing an emotional punch, where all three separate instinctive music themes for the characters seem merge into one and the story's themes open up. Something about this effort feels more personal with its characteristics lending a hearty vibe to its brutal lashings.Leone's novel emphasis is on the dramatic visuals effectively told through brash editing and elastic cinematography that perfectly framed a violent breed of western that was complemented by its harsh dry locations painting a local d\u00e9cor flavour and rich colour tone. On this aspect alone, he spawned a genre. The soap opera story has more scope than the previous outing, in what is more a brazen character journey piece with what starts off as a waiting game that enters conniving turns and lighting-quick standoffs while following two anti-heroes in what is everyman looking after themselves. While not as compact and lean as the first, its inflated nature doesn't make it feel any longer and Leone's material is instrumentally harrowing. The starch, but slight script consists of a wry sense of humour and customary biting exchanges. Morricone's soaring music is excitingly cued, but also the sound effects of the gun crackling and bullets whistling are jarringly pitched.Klaus Kinski also shows up, and is rather distinguishable with a hunchback as one of the hot-tempered outlaws with a malicious glee in his eyes and Luigi Pistilli as well plays a gang members too.Leone's \"For A Few Dollars More\" is an ambitious, stirring and flashy Italian spaghetti western entertainment.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Let the guns do the talking.", "date": "2010-05-30T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2256968"}, {"content": "I was very surprised at this film.

As in the other two instalments, Eastwood portrays the \"Man with No Name\", a mysterious gunman distinguished by his brown poncho, cigar and stubbly beard, more mercenary morally ambiguous than the traditional Western hero. In this episode the Man with No Name is a bounty hunter in pursuit of a ruthless bandit known as \"El Indio\".The film also introduced a second iconic Western star, Lee Van Cleef. Van Cleef was five years older than Eastwood, but his career had stalled after he was injured in a serious car accident in 1958. Here he plays character known as the \"Man in Black\", who is also in pursuit of El Indio. Like Eastwood's character, Van Cleef's is calm, deliberate and laconic and a lethal gunfighter. In other respects, however, the two men are very different. For a start, the Man in Black has a name and a past. We learn that his name is Colonel Douglas Mortimer and that he was originally a Southern gentleman from the Carolinas. In keeping with his gentlemanly status he is always smartly dressed in a black suit. He seems to be a bounty hunter- early in the film we see him killing an outlaw named Guy Calloway for the bounty of $1000- but towards the end we learn that he may have other, personal, reasons for wanting El Indio dead.Of the first two instalments of the trilogy I prefer \"For a Few Dollars More\" to \"A Fistful of Dollars\". (I have not seen \"The Good, The Bad and The Ugly\" for many years, so I will wait until I have seen it again before I decide which of the three is my favourite). Despite being very influential when it came out, the first film can seem today like little more than a run-of-the-mill Western. \"For a Few Dollars More\" is more than that. There are some effective touches, such as the strange quasi-duel where Mortimer shows off his skill with a gun by shooting at the \"Man with No Name\"'s hat, and the recurring motif of a musical pocket watch. (El Indio has such a watch that he plays before engaging in duels). Leone makes effective use of the contrasting styles of his two heroes- I call them that, despite their apparent amorality, because we are clearly intended to root for them against the brutal sadism of El Indio and his gang- and handles the action well, leading up to an enthralling climax. (The action in \"A Fistful of Dollars\", by contrast, can sometimes be confusing).

It may not be as artistic as GBU or OUATITW, but it's a surprisingly well-made movie considering the other 2 get all the attention. This is the most gritty of them, has the best character development, the best shootout, the quintessential spaghetti western score, and is flat-out the most fun.It doesn't have Tuco running through the cemetery, but it has some astoundingly good scenes. For instance, the camera cutting back and forth between Van Cleef's eyes and the Wanted poster with intermittent gunshots heard; the duel for pride between Eastwood and Van Cleef; and, of course, the final showdown. This final showdown is hands-down the best of any Western. It's more interesting than GBU's because the characters mean more. The bad guy is a miserable wretch whose only comfort from his past is violence, Van Cleef's revenge motivation is far more compelling than Harmonica's in OUATITW, and Eastwood is just plain the most badass he's ever been. When Clint walks in with the watch playing the music, you just feel like standing up and applauding. Frankly, I find the duel in OUATITW rather underwhelming and I don't quite understand why some people call it the best ever. It's short, predictable, and nowhere close to this one.The ending is also very satisfying. It's sort of a happy ending, but not sappy because Clint is just way too badass driving away with all the bodies, on his way to becoming a super-rich badass.Overall, it's a close call with GBU, because I also love that movie for many reasons (and West isn't too shabby either). Now I don't want to be one of those guys complaining about a Leone movie being too long, and that's not what I'm doing, but FAFDM also has the advantage of being about 50 minutes shorter than GBU, and 30 shorter than West. This makes the movie more accessible and more practical to watch than the other 2. You can't really watch the other 2 without sort of planning beforehand, whereas with this one, you can watch it on a whim if your bored, without sacrificing 3 hours.Great movie -- the one I come back to again and again.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 4, "votes": 5}, "heading": "Leone's Best... now with SPOILERS for several movies!", "date": "2010-02-22T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2211513"}, {"content": "\"For a Few Dollars More\" is the second of three enormously successful Italian Westerns that Sergio Leone made with future superstar Clint Eastwood in the mid 1960s. The first was \"A Fistful of Dollars\", which though a hit and a good Western, was not original (it was later the subject of a successful lawsuit by Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa who noticed it was very similar to his 1961 film \"Yojimbo\") and the third and best of the trilogy was \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly\", which has now reached icon status. The film in the middle? Well, it's the second-best. It's a little better than \"A Fistful of Dollars\", but is still just on the level of being good. It's a decent, entertaining matin\u00e9e but how masterpiece like its successor.Eastwood returns again as a sneering, poncho-wearing gunfighter who has no name, now on the trail of a notorious bandit named El Indio (Gian Maria Volont\u00e9). While on his tracks, he teams up with another bounty hunter (Lee Van Cleef) whose reason for hunting Indio turns out to be more than the reward.Leone was a director who used the same cinematic styles and camera techniques over and over again. He used montages of close-ups, broad wide angles that remind you of scenes from \"Lawrence of Arabia\" (1962), very little dialogue. And you see all of that in \"For a Few Dollars More.\" It's a very stylistic Western, but how does it fare on entertainment value? On the whole, I liked the movie. I wasn't bored, it kept moving, it didn't try to be anything more than what it was, and I enjoyed it. But on the other hand, it does pale in comparison to \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.\" But perhaps this is an unfair comparison, since very few films come even within range of being as good as the said Italian masterpiece.Although I didn't find it to be an incredible film-going experience, there was a lot to like. Eastwood and Van Cleef were well-cast in the roles of the two conniving bounty hunters and Gian Maria Volont\u00e9 played another good villain. The movie also has a lot of action. It starts with a gunshot and ends with a gunshot and there is lot of gunfire in between. If you can't suspend disbelief or if you dislike movies that more or less glorify violence, you will not enjoy this movie, for Leone makes a very stylish portrayal with his gunfighters making clever remarks and performing fancy tricks as they gun down their opponents. The movie is also aided by a strong score by Ennio Morricone.Bottom line, like \"A Fistful of Dollars\", I thought it was a good Western, but not a great one.

Even Eastwood and Van Cleef's heroes aren't quite as serious as their majestic and iconic appearances would let on. The comedic elements however don't always come off very cleanly which is a bit of a shame.Stylistically the film remains consistent with the Dollars trilogy. However El Indio is not the most compelling antagonist and for this reason his part in the movie comes off rather uninteresting. Between Manco and Colonel Mortimer there's a bit of a void to be filled by a more interesting character and this begins to show in the film's pace. The film feels too long with not enough material to fill the running time.

But when I look into the eyes of Ninjo, I see despair, I see repeated beatedness in his childhood, I see his own abusedness by others.I would be careful with such psychos, but I would NEVERTHELESS try to help him, psychically.Well, of COURSE, in the wild wild west, it would REALLY have been better if the real evil guys would have been shot fast. But that was VERY rarely the case. OK, all westerns show the cruelty of the wild west. But many westerns only show us ONE story in which at the end, the good ones prevail.Note that I wrote \"good\" without any quotation marks, before. That was intended. I believe personally in good and evil, as simple and dull as it may sound.But I don't believe that the good mostly vanquishes evil, I believe in the near exact contrary.In the real wild west, people like the ones that the monk and Clint are displaying, would have a lot smaller chance of survival. True, there were some few ones who shot really well.Anyway, this movie is only offering revenge in the form of the death of the other as a solution, it shows a lot of fictionally and individually worthless \"evil\" (NOW mark the quotation marks!) guys getting shot by two people who kill for money. Oh, how honorable. In this setting, the movie intends to make it believable that at least a few good ones where there among the bounty hunters? Or does this movie unphilosophically laugh upon itself? Surely, the audience laughs a lot. Some people might utter some lots of admiring and pseudo-professional super-admiring statements about this movie, saying it would have maybe been \"underrated\" for a long time until the early 2000s. The main comment on IMDb says this movie would be \"hard\" or \"brutal\", whoa, I laugh myself to death. This movie isn't showing any blood, nearly! This is a soap-opera, it's like caressing my beloved cat in comparison to \"Silence of the lambs\" or then even terrible, unethical movies like \"Hostel\" and \"Saw\", which I cannot watch, at all.I ate some really good spaghetti to my beloved monk and Kinski, and I was in fact very amused by all three of em, well, all four, including the actor playing Ninjo. That they allowed Kinski only one or two words is a scandal.When the camera is showing distanced settings directly on the landscape, when the music is swelling, I have my thoughts about existence, and about the unnecessary cruelty of mankind, and also about the nice moments, the love, the sharing, the happiness.Yea, surely there IS something behind this actual pseudo-western, there is a critical attitude, the one of Mister Sergio Leone who directed it, there IS his strong statement that counter-death was all they had back then when their very lives were threatened - did I say \"threatened\"? OK, so this movie takes bounty hunters whose lives they themselves put into danger in order to enrich themselves, and Leone surely does this fully on purpose, only to compare the bounty hunters' not super-high ethics to the even lower ones of others.While Leone surely doesn't say it would always have been like this, while I myself admire Leone for the other great stuff he shot (note the merely literal [?] similarity between \"shooting\" a film and actual gun-shooting...), I have to say to Mister Leone that this flick of his is rather funny than positively pathetic - being European, I know that most Americans use the word \"pathetic\" in a negative way, but this is their own language salad or abuse. \"Pathos\" derives from Greek and means the grandeur of a situation or of speech, for instance. Only the wannabee-western-like, in fact totally UN-western-like music is pathetic in this movie, the rest is tricking the audience into thoughts of their own as the \"now they shoot them, then they them\"-story progresses - the movie HAS got a good pace, though, and IS not only well-watchable, but a MEGA delight to the casual as well as the aficionado watcher.But to someone who demands more of movies, this is not a great gift.Clint's much later \"Unforgiven\" can be entitled a sequel of this movie, if you want. Some ugly evil men kill innocents, and then the revenge starts.\"Django\" reaches the heigths of big westerns, I like it even more, because it always stays modest. And lovely.

Well, they are all wrong. Going by the instinct that my opinion is better than everyone else's, For a Few Dollars More is Leone at his peak, and one of the better westerns of all-time. Unlike the two films first mentioned, this one doesn't overstay its welcome, doesn't drift off into unnecessary scenes, and ultimately presents Eastwood (and Lee Van Cleef) at his top form. For a Few Dollars More is spaghetti western at its absolute finest, and should be viewed at least once by any fans of the wild west.For a Few Dollars More (No longer under the rage of Kurosawa) is about two bounty hunters after a vicious criminal that recently escaped from prison with the help of his friends. While Man With No Name (Eastwood, of course) is in it for the money, Mortimer's reasons seem a bit more blurred. The film becomes a massive cats-and-mice game as both bounty hunters compete to catch and kill the criminal first.All the elements that made A Fistful of Dollars work were improved upon here: the directing, cinematography, acting, pacing, and musical score. The close-ups, long shots, and quick edits are all Leone's signature, and yet again keep the movie moving and entertaining. The story is not only more original the second time around, but is deeper, and more engrossing.Geez Louise, can I discuss the music here? Morricone's music is truly epic and is twice as good as the first film in the trilogy, and arguably almost as good as his most popular score (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly). Whether it's the simple drumming during a stand-off, a bittersweet pocket watch song, or the fantastic theme in the beginning, Morricone's music should have earned him an Oscar that year (Does anybody even remember Doctor Zhivago's music?). Not only is it great music, but one of the best soundtracks of all-time. To this day the music's influence can be heard: Hans Zimmer's nods to him occur in the Pirates of the Caribbean series.Like the previous installment, there are no heroes in this tale; just a lot of ruthless men fighting each other to reach their just rewards. What makes Few Dollars More better than The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly are two main things: the pacing and the balance of characters. In The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, the movie lasts more than 160 minutes and most of it is focused on The Ugly, by far the least interesting character. The Man With No Name doesn't even do much in the third installment, especially compared to this one. The other issue is pacing; the film like I previously stated is closing in on three hours. In this movie, a mere two hours, perfectly manageable two hours.Bottom Line: A great western with plenty of action and superb storytelling to sink your teeth into. Leone's directing is at his best here, Eastwood is gripping and entertaining, and Morricone's music is sure to leave you enchanted.

FOR A FEW \u0085 is the western to which the theories about Leone's irony and subversion and deconstruction are the least relevant. The whistled score seems almost the gist of the movie; here Leone means rather more melodrama (than usual) and less irony. Since it's the best movie of the triptych, it's also Clint Eastwood's best deal, yet the master of the sets is Van Cleef\u2014cool, handsome, sharp, thoughtful. But I say something more for my intro\u2014in a way, FOR A FEW \u0085 seems not only the most melodramatic Leone western\u2014but the most genuinely surreal as well. This, if you have the same notion of surrealism, of surrealism in cinema, that I do\u2014and that Leone also seemed to have. Almost discretely eerie, and melodramatically eerie. Two bounty hunters, Monco and Mortimer both face a band of bandits headed by a character performed with a nearly Shakeaspearean twist. One notices some symmetry\u2014Volont\u00e9 and Kinski bring an European approach, highly picturesque roles\u2014while both Eastwood and Van Cleef give cool approaches. For me, THE GOOD \u0085, that is the next installment of the triptych, was a bit self\u2014aware; slightly self\u2014aware, though certainly not enough to spoil the fun \u0085. The Monco installment is more melodramatic, more touching\u2014the score, the story, the actors \u0085--and less ironic than its successor.

In fact, the script itself favors greatly Van Cleef over Eastwood. Monco is, no doubt, cool, and a slick executioner; Mortimer is finer. In terms of score and melodrama ,this Leone epic surpasses everything. That Volont\u00e9 released Eastwood and Van Cleef\u2014for a wholly absurd reason\u2014I find it unreasonable and unconvincing, but the movie is good regardless.

I understand the fame of it's trilogy partners, as A Fistful Of Dollars was Eastwood's debut western and The Good, The Bad and The Ugly was the first Leone film to be widely advertised at it's release, but For A Few Dollars More breaks the pattern of the middle film in the trilogy being the poorest, as it is genuinely the most enjoyable watch of the three. I think that the feel of the movie is about as close as Leone could have got to perfection. Perhaps the most obvious reason for this is that the plot is based on bounty hunting, which just works so well. It's a storyline that you feel like you've seen a thousand times (probably on Warner Bros cartoons), but pulled off in the most satisfying way imaginable. I honestly can't sing this film's praises enough. Agreed, the whole trilogy is a masterpiece, but this one has the balance between a great music score, involving plot lines, superb one-liners, inspiring acting, exciting shootouts and memorable characters down to an absolute fine art.

That is why the bounty killers appeared.\"These are the famous words that greet the viewer at the start of \"For A Few Dollars More\". The Follow up to Sergio Leone\" A Fist Full Of Dollars\". The first film , although groundbreaking , had many Faults. The good thing is , that with the follow up , Leone seems to have ironed out the glitches and has produced a near perfect Western.Eastwood is a keen-eyed, quick-witted bounty hunter on the bloody trail of Indio, the territory's most treacherous bandit. But his ruthless rival, Colonel Mortimer , is determined to bring Indio in first...dead or alive! Failing to capture their prey - or eliminate each other - the two are left with only one option: team up, or face certain death at the hands of Indio and his band of murderous outlaws.It's very important when making a western to have characters that you love and hate. Heroes and Villains. With the original film there was Clint Eastwood \" The man with no name\" and he was the only one with any personality to speak off.With this film we are introduced to not only Eastwood's character again but Col. Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef ) and El Indio ( Gian Maria Volont\u00e8) . One a suave looking stranger and sharp shooter who has a score to settle and the other a ruthless bandit who is tortured by his evil past.Talking of Scores , the music is amazing . The haunting sound of that electric guitar is a constant companion and is one of the most iconic scores in movie history.Lee Van Cleef for me is the star of the film. His addition is a stroke of genius of Leone's part. The director also added quite a lot of humour to the film which the first definitely lacked.There are so many great scenes in this movie but my favourite has to be the stand off at the end. When El Indio says to the Colonel \"When the chimes end, pick up your gun.\" Go ahead and shoot me Colonel. Just try.\" He opens up that pocket watch and the chimes that have troubled both men for years , start .

With so many intense close-ups, fast-paced editing, and dizzying flashbacks, the story is crystal-clear and even brings out the best in the actors who are great nevertheless. Eastwood is so perfect in this role it's no wonder he became an icon; and Lee Van Cleef also does great as the Colonel.

Sergio Leone's explosive Spaghetti Western debut 'A Fistful of Dollars (1964)' was produced on a shoestring budget, and, though the financial restraints are easily noticeable in the final cut, the film has such a unique visual style that it didn't really matter. For his follow-up, Leone had a considerably-larger budget with which to toil, and the result is a more coherent and assured editing style, the work of consummate professional. However, at the same time, this creative progression has a simultaneous detrimental effect. Leone, in attempting to craft a (slightly) more conventional picture, was now less inclined to indulge in the unashamedly erratic editing \u0096 such as instant cuts from vast landscapes to sweat-soaked eyes \u0096 that had made his previous film so utterly unique. Nevertheless, great film-making is about finding that ideal balance, and it's reassuring to note that the director did eventually strike it with his next picture, 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966).'In a decade when the Western was beginning to fall out of favour, many Italian directors decided to attempt their own interpretations of the genre, none more successfully than Sergio Leone. These \"Spaghetti Westerns\" dispensed with all respectability that the genre had once possessed, saturating the cinema screen with sweat, blood and smoke. His films are not particularly intellectual, but generations of audiences have delighted in the director's sheer enthusiasm for providing entertainment, and his \"Dollars\" trilogy is now regarded as a classic. 'For a Few Dollars More' was produced second in the loose trilogy, but, chronologically, its storyline is the last to take place. Clint Eastwood returned from his previous star-making performance as the enigmatic \"Man With No Name\" {though he does, in fact, go by the title Monco}, and Gian Maria Volont\u00e8 is deliciously-evil as the ultimate bad guy, El Indio. Though I had fully expected Lee Van Cleef to be also playing a villain, Douglas Mortimer, a respected colonel-turned-bounty hunter, turned out to be a highly-reputable figure, and his performance is marked by a subtle humour that contrasts well with Eastwood's \"straight man.\"The film opens with an ominous intertitle: \"where life had no value, death, sometimes, had its price. That is why the bounty killers appeared.\" These bounty-hunters turn out to be the film's heroes, and we can only watch in awe as Manco and Mortimer expertly go about their daily profession, tracking down wanted fugitives, swiftly murdering them (typically after offering an opportunity to defend themselves) and claiming the hefty reward. Beyond their grizzled exterior, each man has a very definite reason for their chosen line of work: Monco wishes to amass enough money to retire somewhere quiet, and Mortimer is out to avenge the rape and death of his sister. But what happens when the two professional killers set their sights on the same target, perhaps the most lucrative prize of all? Will they decide to cooperate, or will they end up shooting each other in the back? There is a wonderful sequence where the two bounty-hunters match wits, progressively humiliating each other in a bizarre ritual that involves shooting the other man's hat.

Moviegoers mention A Fistful of Dollars, which started it all, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, on the short list of the best movies ever made, elegiac Once Upon a Time in the West, even the more political entry Duck, You Sucker, and Leone's venture in another genre, Once Upon a Time in America; but FAFDM almost seems forgotten at times. Which is a shame, because it's sheer brilliance.The opening is pure Leone, with his classic introductory vignettes: we meet two bounty hunters, Manco (Clint Eastwood), who favours a down and dirty approach, facing a bandit in a saloon and gunning down his henchmen, and methodical Col. Mortimer, who calmly chooses a weapon to shoot a fugitive from an impossible distance. Then we are introduced to Indio (Gian Maria Volont\u00e8), a borderline psycho bandit. Manco and Mortimer team up to kill Indio and his men; the older man has a personal vendetta against the criminal.This movie oozes class. From the scene of Clint walking into a town under a light rain to the final duel, everything is filmed with flair and elegance. Eastwood is an unflappable icon of charisma. Volont\u00e8 plays Indio as a nasty piece of work who is also smart, and dangerous. Van Cleef is magnificent as Mortimer; it's interesting how, in two movies of the Dollars Trilogy, the Man with No Name is the lead, but the emotional compass of the film is another character (Tuco in TGTBTU, Mortimer here).The final scene is fantastic - Leone has rarely done better.

However, two ruthless bounty hunters are after the reward on his head, and are soon on his trail ...Per Qualche Dollaro In Pi\u00f9 is to Leone's great revisionist western Per Un Pugno Di Dollari as Dawn Of The Dead is to Night Of The Living Dead; not as original, but in every other way a better film. It's more mythic, much better acted, has more spectacle and a grander style, and cemented the reputations of Leone, Eastwood and composer Ennio Morricone as the spaghetti western auteurs par excellence. At the heart of it are three totally different and utterly enthralling performances. Eastwood is completely iconic in his classic Man With No Name role - he's so mysterious he's really just a collection of props: a poncho, shrunk-to-fit jeans, a hat, a leather gauntlet, a cigar, a gun. He's the hero who never behaves the way a hero should and yet somehow still is. Van Cleef, as the smart, capable Colonel Mortimer is the puppet-master of the film - the other characters seem to dance around him - and his cool, unblinking resolve is extraordinary. The scene where he strikes a match on hunchbacked Kinski's hump (cult movie star heaven for film geeks) and they stare each other down is a definitive Leone moment, as crucial as Van Cleef's pipe or his Buntline Special revolver. After languishing in bit-parts and TV roles for years, this role made him a minor star who went on to appear in many offbeat classics, such as El Condor and Escape From New York. Yet for me the best performance in the film is Volont\u00e8's astonishing turn as Indio, one of the most fascinating, vicious, complex, thoughtful bad men in all cinema. Indio is an almost unique character-type; the burned-out villain. He's done such dreadful things that almost nothing can satiate him, yet he keeps going. He doesn't seem to care about himself or money, he dices with death, he's haunted by the memory of Mortimer's sister, he smokes marijuana to fend off his demons and keeps exclusively male company. He's almost child-like and yet deeply philosophical at the same time. It's a wild piece of acting. Morricone's brilliant, toe-tapping, lunatic score is one of the most memorable in any western, full of odd instruments (Jewish harps, whistles, timpani, recorders, bells) and incredible trills which act almost as quotation-marks around the action and characters. The last ten minutes are awash in extraordinarily beautiful music. Leone, along with his writing partners, Fulvio Morsella and Luciano Vincenzoni, create a riveting, action-filled, heart-in-the-mouth western adventure, packed with machismo and sly humour (the cut-throat town of Agua Caliente literally means \"hot water\"). Leone's great genius was to galvanise his players and technicians into creating something completely unique and totally cinematic. He went on to even greater heights with his subsequent Il Bueno, Il Brutto, Il Cattivo, but this preceding classic is a treat to savour, with three mesmerising performances.

This exciting bounty hunter shoot'em up has Monco (Clint Eastwood) forming an uneasy alliance with Carolina-bred Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) to wipe out a ruthless gang of murderous desperadoes. Monco wants the bounty on El Indio (Gian Maria Volonte of \"A Bullet for the General\") and his gang, while Colonel Mortimer vows to kill Indio strictly out of revenge. It seems that Indio tried to rape Mortimer' sister and she shot herself with Indio's revolver. A multitude of distinctive Leone touches appear in this fabulous frontier saga; this represents the first time that Leone would stage a gunfight in the round. Meanwhile, Ennio Morricone's theme music is classic with its chiming bells, piercing whistles, and crisp sounding cracks of a whip, but it is the tender and moving watch-piece theme that is really memorable here. Again, the action takes place in the craggy mountainous regions of Spain that substitute marvelously for the American southwest. Every time that a six-gun toting character tramps the gritty earth with his jingling, spur-clad boots, you can hear the scratchy sound of dirt being displaced. The sets seem so much more authentic the way that they have been grafted to the spartan scenery.The opening words on screen establish \"For a Few Dollars More\" as a bounty hunting oater: \"Where life has no value, death sometimes has its price. This is why the bounty hunters appeared.\" Clint Eastwood returns as the monosyllabic gunman dressed in a serape, with wrist-bands, and a Colt's .45 revolver with a coiled snake on the plow handle grip. More than Eastwood's stoic performance, it is Lee Van Cleef's formidable presence as a natty stranger who carries an arsenal of weapons on his horse that makes this western stand out. Originally, Leone had sought the services of Lee Marvin. Marvin would have been exemplary, but veteran western heavy Lee Van Cleef made the character of the Colonel into one of his most memorable roles. Later, Van Cleef would stretch the Colonel character a bit farther in Gianfranco Parolini's exciting saga \"Sabata.\" As the pot-smoking villain, Gian Maria Volonte challenges both men at every turn of the plot. Volonte looks like the equivalent of a crazed wolf with his lupine features and grizzled hair. There is a psychotic glint in his eyes that make you believe that he prefers to shoot first and ask questions later. Everybody here looks like a mutant, especially Klaus Kinski as a killer with a hunchback. Leone characterizes each character with an Ennio Morricone motif.The action this time around has El Indio's band of killers breaking him out of prison. Coincidentally, Indio shares his cell with a carpenter who knows a thing or two about the safe at the Bank of El Paso. El Indio (Gian Maria Volonte of \"Investigation of a Citizen Above Suspicion\")and his gunmen kill all the uniformed prison guards and Indio shoots the warden. Later,Indio arranges to rob a bank. Monco and Colonel Mortimer arrive in town at the same time. They agree to work together but neither truly trusts the other. Earlier, they spent an evening shooting at each other's hats that stalled into a stand-off. Monco shot at Mortimer's hat and the hat skidded past Mortimer. Comparatively, Mortimer blows Monco's hat off his head and continues to shoot at it in the air. The bank hold-up itself differs from most westerns of the day. After they blast a hole in the rear of the bank, the bandits take the entire safe, something that would be imitated in \"Sabata,\" and haul it off in a wagon. Mortimer worms his way into the gang because he claims that he can open it with nitro after the villains cannot blast it open without destroying the bank notes. Meanwhile, Monco infiltrates the gang by breaking El Indio's right-hand man Sancho Perez (Panos Papadopoulos) out of prison. Each shoot out is terrifically staged and the gunshots themselves are nothing like the American equivalent. The final shoot-out in the round with the chimes on the watch serving as the timing device is imaginative. \"For a Few Dollars More\" is better than both \"A Fistful of Dollars\" and \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.\" British spaghetti western expert Christopher Frayling has written an excellent book about this movie and its shattering impact on American westerns as well as Italian westerns.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 2}, "heading": "An Undisputed Sergio Leone Classic!", "date": "2008-05-25T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1880020"}, {"content": "'Per qualche dollaro in pi\u00f9' AKA 'For A Few Dollars More' bears the curse of a middle sibling, overlooked while Sergio Leone's 'Fistful of Dollars' and mammoth-sized 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' draw wider attention. This is not necessarily a bad thing, since anyone who watches 'For A Few Dollars More' with lower expectations has a chance of being surprised. Realizing the success of his original film, Leone put considerably more work into his script and direction this time around. 'For A Few Dollars More,' co-written mainly by Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni, develops its characters to a fuller extent, is based on a more expansive scale, and uses technical aspects such as editing, music, and sound to form a more cohesive, almost symphonic plot line.Once again, Leone does not specify a time for the action but names places in New Mexico and Texas. The story opens in Tucumcari, a small New Mexican town, where the Man With No Name (Clint Eastwood, called 'Monco' in this film) and former colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) arrive separately to ply their trade as bounty hunters. The men find wanted posters of El Indio (Gian Maria Volont\u00e8), a psychotic robber who is busted out of prison by his gang. Eastwood and Mortimer realize that the odds of a single man finishing off Indio's gang are slim; the men decide to work together and split $20,000 in reward money, should they walk away from the killings. Their plan to nab Indio at the central bank in El Paso fails, allowing him to get away with thousands of dollars and considerably upping the reward for his head. Eastwood and Mortimer lock horns as matters unfold, but wisely respect and depend upon each other's skills. We also learn that one of the bounty hunters carries a second and deeper-lying reason for tracking Indio down.While Eastwood remains a solid presence as the Man With No Name, Lee Van Cleef is superb as Mortimer, a refined, dapper individual who can gunsling with the best of them. Mortimer puts Eastwood's character in striking relief, undoing much of the superhero element that impels 'Fistful of Dollars.' He forms a rugged pair with Eastwood and reminds us that even the best fighters can use some help. Gian Maria Volont\u00e8 has the thankless job of dying in back-to-back films but gives excellent character work as a rogue who has surrendered to inner demons and holds no sanctity for human life. Other actors return from 'Fistful of Dollars,' including Joseph Egger (as Old Prophet), Benito Stefanelli (Luke), and Aldo Sambrell (Cuccillo). Cult icon Klaus Kinski also has a role as gang member Wild the Hunchback.After shoe-stringing 'Fistful of Dollars,' Leone had a visibly larger budget in the second film. Again recorded in the Andaluc\u00eda region of Spain, 'For A Few Dollars More' uses expansive outdoor settings and wide interiors while employing a larger cast and numerous extras. There is simply more room to work with and more things are going on, all presented in Leone's unique style. Leone shows greater confidence with his material, employing closeup, flashback, and deceptive angles quite liberally. The superior production values could only help cinematographer Massimo Dallamano, whose lens captured every nuance of the 'southwestern' heat. Ennio Morricone has great moments in 'Fistful of Dollars,' but the famed orchestrations come into their own during this sequel. By intermingling a large orchestra and chorus with aspects of the plot (especially the chimes of a stolen pocket watch), Morricone's score becomes a fourth main character who offers psychological insight.Admittedly, 'For A Few Dollars More' is pure gold for those who love errors - there are obvious goofs such as playing cards that look too new for the 19th century, missing teeth that reappear, and ignored historical facts (Tucumcari, New Mexico, didn't exist until 1901). The dubbing is just as bad as in 'Fistful of Dollars,' if not worse; Eastwood's own voice is out of sync at times and the dubbing of non-English actors is terrible. However, these problems do nothing to spoil Leone's overlying effort. 'For A Few Dollars More' is an absorbing experience in the western genre, rivaled only by his 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' and 'Once Upon a Time in the West.' There are actually a large number of fans and critics who rate 'For A Few Dollars More' over 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' because of its shorter running time (131 minutes) and more concentrated development.Western fans had a long stretch before the advent of DVD, when full frame VHS tapes and TV broadcasts robbed 'For A Few Dollars More' of its sharpness. MGM, who holds first rights to United Artists' library, released a DVD in 1998 that is closer to Leone's original vision. The disc, which is offered both individually and as part of a 'Man With No Name' boxed set, presents 'For A Few' in letterbox format (2.35:1) with Dolby enhancement of the original mono track; French 'dubbing' is offered with subtitles in English, French, and Spanish. 'For A Few Dollars More' has respectable print quality with only occasional grain and speckling; sound quality is very good, balancing dialogue, effects such as gunshots, and Morricone's ever-important score. The only extra is For A Few's trailer, which points out anglicized names taken by Volont\u00e8 and Leone in 'Fistful of Dollars.' MGM has since released a two-DVD special edition with major restorations and supplements as part of the Sergio Leone Anthology. Either way, the film is highly recommended and a must for collectors.*** out of 4Roving Reviewer - www.geocities.com/paul_johnr", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "As Eastwood says in the finale, 'Bravo.'", "date": "2008-03-31T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1849939"}, {"content": "In this \"Man With No Name\" movie, Eastwood's character is identified by the sheriff who pays Van Cleef his bounty money as \"Manco\" - or \"sleeve\" in Spanish.Note that when Eastwood goes into the tavern after Baby Cavanaugh, he does all his fisticuffs with his left hand only, leaving his gun hand, the right hand, always free.

But it of course is the directing and story-telling style of Sergio Leone that makes the movie work out so well. He takes his time to build up sequences and its excitement. This movie is really not halve as action filled as you perhaps would expect but it still is at least halve more exciting than most other westerns with lots of action in it. This says something about the effective directing approach of Leone. Of course his trademarks elements such as extreme close-ups of eyes, flashbacks, slow storytelling, gritty atmosphere and stand-offs are all present here.Lee Van Cleef plays one of his very best roles. Gian Maria Volont\u00e8 also did a really good job at playing the movie its real main villain, although of course I still prefer Eli Wallach. And Clint Eastwood does what he can do best in this movie; playing one tough but righteous character. It was also quite nice to see Klaus Kinski in this one!And of course you can't get around Ennio Morricone's musical score.

But can these two men take on and take out an army of outlaws?A Fistful of Dollars may have come first and The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly may be the fanboy's choice, but my favorite movie in Sergio Leone's Dollar's Trilogy is For a Few Dollars More. In contrast to the first movie in the trilogy, For a Few Dollars More is a more sophisticated, more confident film. Leone took the ideas he developed in A Fistful of Dollars and ran with them. There's definite growth in Leone as a director. Similarly, you can see growth in Eastwood and Morricone. All three - director, actor, and composer - were coming into their own with confidence to spare. And in comparison with the better known third movie in the trilogy, For a Few Dollars More is a tighter, more fluid film. It may be one of the best movies ever made, but The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly does tend to drag every now and then. That's not he case with For a Few Dollars More. There's not a wasted moment. But please, don't misinterpret anything I've written - I think all three movies are works of genius. I just happen to prefer For a Few Dollars More to the other two.Beyond Leone, Eastwood, and Morricone, any discussion of For a Few Dollars More wouldn't be complete without mentioning the rest of the cast and the sets.The Cast: Eastwood may be the more known commodity, but he often is upstaged in this movie by both Van Cleef and Volont\u00e8. In fact, Volont\u00e8 steals most every scene in which he appears. His dope-smoking, homicidal Indio is one of the most ruthless and memorable characters I've seen in a Spaghetti Western. Another interesting casting decision is that of Klaus Kinski. His screen time may be limited, but his scenes with Van Cleef are among the most memorable in the movie. The rest of the cast, especially Mario Brega and Luigi Pistilli, are just as solid.The Sets: For a Few Dollars more looks like a million dollars thanks to some wonderful sets. Some of the villages found in and around Almeria, Spain, are incredible looking. It would be difficult to duplicate the authenticity of a place like Los Albaricoques with its cobbled streets and white-washed adobe buildings. Yet when called upon to do so, Carlo Simi designed and built some equally impressive sets. His attention to detail in the planning and set decoration is impressive.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 4}, "heading": "\"When the chimes end, pick up your gun.\"", "date": "2007-07-09T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1689797"}, {"content": "With this follow-up to \"Fistful of Dollars\",Sergio Leone crafted a superior sequel with Clint Eastwood more or less repeating his character from the previous film.With much of the same cast as in \"Fistful\",Volonte again as the bad guy,there's the added attraction of Lee van Cleef making perhaps a greater impact than Eastwood.

This was the third in the series I saw and Lee Van Cleef had two strikes going against him. Because he was playing opposite Clint Eastwood and because he was such a nasty villain in THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY, I was a bit prejudiced against Van Cleef's character, Col. Mortimer the first time I saw this movie. Now, after several viewings, I've come to sympathize with his character almost as much as Clint's Manco. Like ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, Van Cleef's character is a bit like Harmonica's in that he has a personal score to settle with Indio. Also, like ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST, Col. Mortimer's motives are shown through piecemeal flashback sequences throughout the movie. Though his and Clint Eastwood's characters have different motives for wanting to track down Indio, I found myself rooting for both of them the last time I saw this movie, ie, Manco is motivated by money, Mortimer motivated by revenge.The only annoying thing I found about this movie, and it seems to be true of every Western I've ever seen, is that while the main villain is kicking the crap out of the good guys (and in a Sergio Leone movie, that term is used rather loosely), his cohorts are standing around giggling like a bunch of little girls. I have seen this in just about every Western I've ever watched and it tends to get a bit annoying. Barring that, anything put out by the team of Leone, Eastwood, and Morricone with his haunting music is nothing short of great.

After the success of the groundbreaking Fistful of Dollars, Sergio Leone returned with his second instalment in the dollars trilogy. The scale was bigger, the style was bolder, and the moral standards were lower.The title itself works on many levels. The films budget was of course somewhat more than the cheaply made Fistful. On top of that everything is pushed just a little further in this picture. Whereas Fistful was just set in one town, we now travel all over the old west, and for the first time we see those incredible landscape shots that Leone did so well. The direction and storytelling is much more confident. There is a fairly bizarre level of stylisation, with huge facial close-ups, fast paced editing and long-drawn out stand-offs.Many viewers talk of Leone's debt to classic Hollywood westerns, as well as the films of Akira Kurosawa, but while these are part of the mix his style really reminds me of nothing more than Sergei Eisenstein at his most flamboyant. Think about those fast edits between Mortimer's face and Indio's poster, or the series of close-ups during each build up to a gunfight, then look at Eisenstein's Strike or October and you'll see what I mean. Those films must have been a massive influence on Leone, although it's rarely acknowledged.Each of the three main characters gets their own lengthy introductory scene which take up nearly a full half hour before the story really gets underway. We open with Mortimer, his head buried in a bible. Given the way he acts afterwards \u0096 forcing the train to stop, intimidating people and coldly and calmly killing an outlaw \u0096 this is an example of the rather ambiguous attitude Leone takes towards religion throughout this and his other pictures. Manco first appears in a thunderstorm. Indio's first scene is gloomy and sinister. All three men are established as killers. Nearly all the characters are after one thing \u0096 money. It's not just the bandits and bounty hunters. Even the boy who holds Manco's horse is always after another dollar. I say nearly all the characters \u0096 there is of course one goal more important in the spaghetti western than money, and that is vengeance.For a Few Dollars more isn't just bigger in every way, it's also better in that it is more professional, particularly the acting. Clint Eastwood had by now gained more confidence, and had perfected his slow, silent, moody persona that would become his trademark. There are plenty of great supporting parts, and the dubbing of Italian actors is pretty seamless. However the real jewel in the crown was the rediscovery of Lee Van Cleef. Van Cleef had made a career of bit parts in Hollywood westerns, usually as a mean-looking outlaw. Leone cast him as the most heroic and honest of the three main characters. Perhaps a touch of irony was intended, but the truth is Van Cleef turned out to be a great actor (I'm always particularly struck by the very genuinely emotional look on his face when he realises Manco has taken his watch), and ideally suited to playing the good guy for a change. Having retired once in Hollywood, he eventually enjoyed a second career as one of the most prominent leading men in the spaghetti western genre.Of course, the mix of Leone's films wouldn't be complete without the music of Ennio Morricone, and here for the first time director and composer are truly in synch. Morricone is truly Leone's musical equivalent. Just like Leone's shooting style, Morricone's music isn't afraid to draw attention to itself. In this era a good film score was supposed to be one you didn't notice, but Morricone does the opposite. It is weird, wonderful and very listenable in its own right. The music in For a Few Dollars more is also matched up to the action in a way that hadn't happened since the days of silent cinema. Each character gets their own little musical motif \u0096 Mortimer has the Jewish harp twangs, Manco the bouncy flute melody and Indio the ominous bells. It's not a background score \u0096 it's excessive musical punctuation for Leone's style. In that first great duel in the church between Indio and the man who turned him in, when you hear that eerie little pocket watch tune, and then the organ crashes in with a rip-off of Bach's Toccata \u0096 then you know you're in the Leone zone!", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 4, "votes": 5}, "heading": "In a world where life had no value", "date": "2007-03-06T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1612790"}, {"content": "Although For a Few Dollars More has all the trademark and inherent problems with Euro-Westerns (dubbing, locales, scenery-chewing, and everyone looking like they're from . . .

Clearly it's not an extension of A Fistful of Dollars, nor is it related to the biggest of the three, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, but it has its own independent story, and it's the most pleasing of the three movies on a thinking level. Here, Clint Eastwood is slightly eclipsed by Lee Van Cleef. They're both bounty hunters after the same criminal, but Van Cleef has personal issues with \"Indio\" while Eastwood just wants the cash. In the long run, we care more about Colonel Mortimer than Monco, and this gives FAFDM its unique quality, even if a \"quality spaghetti western\" is an oxymoron to you.Yet, Sergio Leone made Tuco in GBU more entertaining than Blondie. You want Blondie to get the gold, but not kill Tuco (although he sure deserves it!). By the end of FAFDM, you're rooting for the Van Cleef character; Eastwood is just a killing machine, much like his character in Where Eagles Dare. Whether or not this is what Leone wanted--or if he desired Van Cleef and Eastwood to be equals--I think most folks will have taken sides fairly early on.I didn't find this movie nearly as visually exciting as GBU and the preposterousness of some of the plotting and action may make you squirm or roll your eyes, but I recommend For a Few Dollars More because it's an emotionally satisfying western at its heart.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 3}, "heading": "Satisfying Spaghetti", "date": "2007-02-15T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1599485"}, {"content": "Many consider this film the most perfectly realized of Leone's trilogy, though I prefer the grander sweep of The Good The Bad and The Ugly. This is the best film in the series to start with, though, being slightly more polished than Fistful Of Dollars, and it's easier to follow as a template of the Leone style.Contrary to popular critical opinion, this is definitely not a 'revisionist' western. What Leone has done has stripped the traditional western story down to its essential elements and flipped it. Basically, this is an ordinary western saga seen through a distorted (or clearer, depending on your viewpoint) lens. All westerns were generally made with the same characteristics, that is, a good guy and a bad guy. The good guy was simple: a lawman or rancher protecting something. The bad guy was usually the more interesting one. Leone made the so called 'good guy' more interesting, and more vicious than the villain. The story becomes the mirror image of the American Western, reflected from the deserts of Spain.Eastwood, despite the dispute of others, is \"The Man With No Name\", and it's not only his identity that's unknown, it's his motives, his purpose, his origin. He's the focal point of the story, even though here he spends a lot of background time, letting Van Cleef and the others stand out in many striking scenes. This is Leone's genius at work. We never forget Eastwood is there, somewhere.The two great characteristics of the trilogy are the close-ups and the music. These are better done here than in the others.

I enjoy this film a lot, and recognize that it's a more polished piece of work than \"A Fistful of Dollars.\" But sometimes I get a little bored watching \"For a Few Dollars More,\" and that simply doesn't happen to me during its predecessor or its sequel.I do know for certain that I love Lee Van Cleef in this movie. He's deadly, witty, stylishly dressed and simply too cool for words. I also love his funky array of guns, and his motivation is suitably compelling.By contrast, Clint Eastwood's Man with no Name is actually a little dull. (Eastwood is, by the way, called Monco here. I tend to think that this is his real name, rather than the obvious nicknames \"Joe\" and \"Blondie\" we get in the other films.)

Not in my opinion anyways. Stereotypical simply means that the film follows the familiar pattern and when you're making a film following a certain genre, this is not a bad thing. Western's should for the most part try and fit into the tried and true mold and For A Few Dollars More does that exactly. You've got the dusty Western town, the villains, the bounties, and most important the bounty hunters. One thing that absolutely makes For A Few Dollars More stand out is the incredible chemistry and pairing of the stars Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood. The two of them teamed up against each other later in The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly, but this time they team up together or try. I admit that I didn't find For A Few Dollars More quite as well filmed or action packed as Fistful of Dollars but it still lives up to it's classic reputation.Clint Eastwood returns in his Western role of The Stranger only this time we know a little more about him. Eastwood is a bounty hunter who is desperate to become rich by tracking down some of the bigger bounties out there. Eastwood is definitely not as light hearted as he was previously in Fistful of Dollars and instead plays the straight man to Van Cleef's rather humorous dialog. He's still quick with his wit and faster with his guns and plays his usual role flawlessly. Lee Van Cleef plays fellow bounty hunter Douglas Mortimer. Van Cleef is terrific, has some great dialog and easily goes toe to toe and holds his own against Eastwood as well he should being the veteran of the two. Their chemistry together is unmistakable and the film plays out almost like an 80's buddy cop film but set in the old west and from the sixties. The two are reluctant partners and at the same time scrambling for the same riches. However as the story unfolds we discover that Van Cleef's character has some bigger ulterior motives to tracking the villain. The villain is played by Gian Maria Volont\u00e8, Indio a man who is freed from Prison and returns to his large gang of men to cause havoc and destruction wherever they go which means big dollars for The Bounty Hunters. Volont\u00e8 is fairly typical as the Western villain but again sometimes a stereotype can be good for a tried and true genre and Volont\u00e8 does quite well.Director Sergio Leone continues to prove that he has a great deal of talent telling a story packed with action. You never once find yourself bored in a Leone western that I have seen as of yet and they always feel ahead of their time in their style and story on a minute budget. I would recommend seeing Fistful of Dollars first because I do think it was slightly superior to this in it's witty script and fast paced action and although For A Few Dollars More has that as well it's just not quite as good but very close don't get me wrong!! However it does have one thing that you can't miss out on and that is the infamous Lee Van Cleef who is just fantastic especially when paired with Eastwood.

Not only the films looked grittier, violent and realistic; the characters in Leone's westerns became complex men with complex and obscure moral codes, very far away from the classic clear moral opposites of previous westerns. \"Per Qualche Dollaro in pi\u00f9\" (\"For a few dollars more\"), is the epitome of all this. It is a powerful, raw and ruthless masterpiece that transcended its genre and became one of the best movies of all-time.\"For a Few Dollars More\", the second in the so-called \"Dollars trilogy\" (a group of films by Leone with the same style), is the story of two different yet very similar men, Manco (Clint Eastwood) and the Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) are two bounty hunters who are after the criminal named \"El Indio\" (Gian Maria Volont\u00e8). An unlikely alliance occurs between the two lone wolves as they decide to cooperate and divide the reward, but are these two killers after \"Indio\" for the same reason? Written by Fulvio Morsella and Sergio Leone himself, the film's main characteristic is the complex moral code the main characters follow. They are no longer the perfect clean heroes of classic westerns, both Manco and the Colonel have well-developed attitudes, motivations and purposes; they are neither completely good nor completely bad, they are just real. The story unfolds with a fine pace and good rhythm, it is probably the best structured of the \"Trilogy\" and the easiest to follow. It is also the one that represents the elements of the Spaghetti Western style the best.Stylistically, the film follows closely the conventions established by Leone's previous film but it takes them to the next level. The excellent use of minimalistic cinematography and the superb musical score by Ennio Morricone complement Leone's realistic vision of Westerns and completely redefined the genre's conventions. \"For a Few Dollars More\" is a violent tale of two hunters, and visually the film transmits the same emotions the characters feel. No more myths, the Westerns never felt this real.Clint Eastwood's super performance as Manco is very important for the success of the film, as he is the one that takes the audience through this brave new world, however, the star of the film is Lee Van Cleef as Colonel Mortimer. In one of his best performances ever, Van Cleef manages to be both menacing and interesting, giving life to Leone's brilliant script with great talent. Gian Maria Volont\u00e8 as Indio complements the two big talents as the crazed criminal with a dark past, he is the perfect counterpart of the two lone wolves.\"Per qualche dollaro in pi\u00f9\" is a near flawless movie, as every piece of the puzzle falls into the right place to create a marvelous and unforgettable picture. It's only minor problem may be the dubbing, but fortunately, it still is superior to the one heard in other Italian productions of the same time and it doesn't hurt the film. Fans will always argue about which of the three films of the \"trilogy\" is the best, and while personally I prefer \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" over this one, it is just a matter of personal taste as this film is as perfect as that one.

He is so cold, calculating and non-emotional that he is perhaps one of the creepiest heroes in Westerns. Then, the action switches to Eastwood--doing pretty much the same thing, though with a bit more bravado and a little less menace. Both men are bounty hunters and apparently are nearly unstoppable. Then, the film switches to a prison break, where \"El Loco\" is being extracted as his gang wipes out almost everyone in the prison.Well, El Loco has a $10,000 bounty and each of his men have bounties as well, so both Van Cleef and Eastwood head to El Paso, as they assume his gang can't resist attacking the richest bank in the West. However, shortly after our bounty hunters arrive, they discover the other is there for the same reason. So, instead of killing each other (which it sure looks like they might do), they decide to team up and split the reward money. However, down deep they both seem pretty foolish as they seem to want to take on the murderous gang alone and not split the money! The plan is for Eastwood to infiltrate the gang while Van Cleef attacks. This seems reasonable, as one of the gang members (the ever-handsome Klaus Kinski) knows Van Cleef. To infiltrate them, Eastwood \"stretches the law a bit\" by breaking one of El Loco's buddy's out of prison. Because they seem to trust him, Eastwood is sent with a few guys to divert the El Paso authorities to a fake robbery in another town. Eastwood does this but then kills the gang members with him. You see, Eastwood doesn't want the sheriff and his men on hand to get the reward! Unfortunately, the robbery does NOT occur the way Van Cleef and Easatwood reason it would, and El Loco and the surviving gang members escape with the money. It's actually nice to see this because up until now, the two have looked invincible. So, Eastwood re-joins the gang and Van Cleef follows. Once again, it seems very uncertain if these two really are a team or out to trick the other out of the reward. It's obvious that Eastwood's sole motivator is money, whereas Van Cleef's is only revealed at the end of the film.Eastwood AND Van Cleef both infiltrate the gang (after Van Cleef kills Kinski to prevent him from talking). All seems to be going well and the two guys are waiting for their chance to pick them off one by one and return the stolen money to El Paso. However, it turns out that the incredibly sadistic El Loco is quite the schemer and knows the two are bounty hunters. So, the gang beats the stuffing out of the duo (though only a short time later they look just fine!) and tie them up and place a guard on them. However, El Loco is a major jerk and plans on killing off most of the gang and keeping the money for himself. So, he arranges for Eastwood and Van Cleef's escape (this is a really DUMB plan and a big shortcoming in the story). He reasons that the gang and the bounty hunters will wipe each other out as El Loco and his friend escape with the dough.Unfortunately for El Loco, the gang is quickly wiped out and he is face-to-face with Van Cleef at the end of the film. Van Cleef shoots him but the wound is not fatal and El Loco's shot knocks away Van Cleef's gun! This leads to El Loco's trademark--he has a shoot out with his opponent which is to begin the second his pocket watch stops playing music. Well, just before the music stops, Eastwood shows up and saves Van Cleef's life--allowing him to retrieve his gun. It turns out Van Cleef had an identical watch to El Loco's because many years earlier El Loco had murdered Van Cleef's sister and brother-in-law! So, Eastwood being a cool guy and all, lets Van Cleef have the honor of killing El Loco in the gun fight. Van Cleef is so thrilled that Eastwood gave him a chance for revenge that he decides that he doesn't want the money and tells Eastwood he can have all the reward money. The final shot is of Eastwood stacking up all the MANY bodies and figuring how much money he will have earned. The dollar amount isn't quite right and he quickly spins around to waste the one surviving bad guy who just came out of hiding--telling Van Cleef he must have either miscounted or forgot to kill one of them! Now that I've given a pretty thorough overview of the film, let's talk about what I liked. The music is classic spaghetti Western music--over-the-top and really, really cool! The villains are pure evil and fun to watch. The good guys are also pretty scary and fun to watch. But what I liked most about the film was its sense of humor (despite being a very violent film). The scene where Eastwood is talking to the crazy old man in the shack is wonderful and so are several little vignettes spaced throughout the film. The not-quite-a-prequel to this film, A FIST FULL OF DOLLARS was based on Kurosawa's Yogimbo and Sanjuro--and in this film, humor was also occasionally used to break the violence and tension extremely well. One final note is about the performances of Klaus Kinski and Van Cleef. I was absolutely amazed at Kinski's facial expressions--as he was able to make his face tick violently when he was scared. This was amazing and I doubt many people could do this. As for Van Cleef, I really think he stole the show in the film despite Eastwood being so strongly associated with the film. He was truly menacing and the focal point for much of the film.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 14, "votes": 17}, "heading": "A terrific film--one of the best of the Italian Westerns", "date": "2006-07-04T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1410503"}, {"content": "This morning strictly by chance, I happened to watch \"Any Gun Can Play\" from a DVD set of spaghetti Westerns, a film largely considered a knockoff parody of \"For A Few Dollars More\". So this evening, in a bit of cosmic serendipity, the Sergio Leone classic happened to be playing on AMC, thus inviting a chance to compare notes.'Dollars' has not one, but two scenes where Eastwood's Monco character guns down three outlaws in rapid succession, the first time when confronting Red Cavanaugh, and later on the trail to Santa Cruz to rob the bank with a trio from Indio's gang. It's the latter that more closely resembles the opening scene from 'Any Gun...' However the dead on copy is the balcony binocular scene when Eastwood and Van Cleef realize each other's presence as a potential payday threat. It sets up an interesting hat duel between Monco and Colonel Mortimer.Hey didn't you just love those facial tics on Klaus Kinski as the Hunchback when Mortimer strikes a match on his face; I tried doing it and it's not that easy, especially when you add the menace. The other character that got my reaction was the Old Prophet telling Monco how he didn't sell his land to the railroad (as the train passes by - great touch!); I had a mental picture of Robin Williams doing that scene in exactly the same way.I started counting when Mortimer considers three reasons for he and Monco to team up to defeat Indio. For starters, it would be fourteen against one for either of them to go it alone. Secondly, better make it fifteen to one while each has to keep track of the other bounty hunter. Now was it just me, or didn't Mortimer spell out the third reason, unless one assumes it was for one of them to infiltrate Indio's gang. Anyway, as far as story continuity goes, after Monco takes out three of Indio's men on the way to Santa Cruz, the gang is shown riding a couple of times and you can count thirteen men on horseback. Forty years later and this version of the Western genre is still going strong, and for my part, they'll always have a taker when I'm flipping through the channels.

So Van Cleef has not just one weapon, but an arsenal...Volonte doesn't just escape prison, he kills the lawman who put him there AND his family, AND any temporary ally that suits him...Eastwood doesn't just off the bad guys, he carts away fourteen at once, limbs in all directions.There's a brilliant scene that has all three interested parties counting out the guards' steps around El Paso bank, combining mastery of the style, camera perspectives and ambiguity.Where it gets dicey is the attempt to leverage story ironies -- the questions of who trusts who, and for what reasons. Leone attempts to give El Indio an ironic edge with the conflation of memory, rape, guilt and honor triggered by the pocket watch chimes (expanding into a Fugue). But I don't think this is a real success -- Volonte is still a single-minded villain who just wants a 'larger share of dollars'.

Where else can you find a villain so cool and heartless as this bastard? Now what do we have in this movie? We have Lee Van Cleef (who played Angel Eyes) but not as a villain.

A Fistful of Dollars is a great film: revolutionary, gritty, violent, and fun, and it certainly was the true beginning of a monumental change in westerns. However, this is the first film where Leone's brilliance fully comes to the front. On the other hand, while not quite as famous (in the English-speaking world) as the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (GBU) and perhaps not quite as great a cinematic achievement as GBU or Once Upon a Time in the West (OUTIW), this film is nevertheless not far behind those clear masterpieces.The characteristic Leone visual style and incredible artistry are very powerful here. Although some of this is evident in small amounts in the previous film, here we really get to see the incredible, revolutionary close-ups and the contrast between close-ups and long shots. These and other images are powerful and beautiful. The film also brings the deliberate pacing and wonderful, almost unbearable, build-up of tension before quick action. Leone's sense of irony and brilliant weaving together of various motifs and symbols (particularly religious) also comes to the forefront in this film, as does the humour.The story is more complex than before, and more emotional and profound than GBU or OUTIW. Not until Duck, You Sucker! does Leone really delve more into emotions and psyches more than here, which gives this film an added depth and power. The scenes showing Indio's psyche, obsession, and mental decay are also powerful and perfect. Some (including Leone himself, apparently) feared that Volonte was overacting a tad, while others point out how the flashbacks are supposedly inaccurate portrayals of the effects of marijuana, however, this all works incredibly well. Volonte is quite convincing as a criminal sinking into a form of psychosis and obsessed with personal demons of the past and the flashbacks work brilliantly at hitting this theme home, creating an powerful, surreal, mournful, and lonely eeriness that, although it is not clear at first, perfectly parallels Mortimer's own despair and quest.The the way in which the story progresses, and brings the three main characters together, is brilliant. The introductions of the characters to how Mortimer and Manco focus on the same bandit (Indio), but with the reason for the interests rather subtly and vaguely indicated from the start, to how Mortimer and Manco \"duel\" before joining forces (sort of) is perfect. The music here, while similar to, and less famous than, the score for GBU, is also simply incredible. Just as this film reveals the first full flowering of Leone's gifts, it is also the first full flowering of Morricone's abilities and style introduced in the prior film. The score is in fact just as incredible as Morricone's subsequent ones and it excels at creating a sense of loneliness, despair, mournfulness, and eeriness in a way the even GBU doesn't and which fewof his other scores have. The only scores of his that I can think of which match or excell it on this point Once Upon a Time in America (at least with respect to despair, mourning, and loneliness), The Great Silence, OUTIW (but the harmonica music only) and The Untouchables (in despair and eeriness). This score thus perfectly conveys the atmosphere of the lonely, unpleasant towns, the lonely, harsh life of the bounty hunters, the harshness of the outlaws and Indio's increasingly crazed mind, and Mortimer's despair and personal quest. Finally, we for the first time get to see Lee van Cleef in a first role and he is simply outstanding. He handles the role so well, it's hard to imagine that he had nothing even approaching this magnitude before. This film really has no real faults, the only ones being a few technical errors such as the discrepancy in the wanted poster that Mortimer slides under the door near the beginning. However, these are tiny, most people won't notice, and no-one should really care about them. They are also problems that vanished in Leone's later films where he had more time and more money. In terms of length and pacing, this is also one of Leone's shorter, faster-paced films. Only a Fistful of Dollars and Duck, You Sucker! compare in those terms. This can be good, or bad, depending on the person, interests, or mood. Personally, Leone's longer masterpieces are my favourites, but sometimes even I don't have the time or patience to sit through their relatively slow development (and I am someone who can watch the 3.75-hour Once Upon A Time in America over and over) and want the quicker pace, action, and wit of this film. Also, certainly for some people this movie will be better suited on this point and those who find GBU or OUTIW to be a tad long should opt for this. It certainly is one of the two most lively and fun of Leone's films (the other being the longer GBU). On the whole, the combination of everything makes this a brilliant masterpiece and the pacing and development make the film extremely fun and fast-paced to watch. It is a clear masterpiece.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 4}, "heading": "Simply Incredible", "date": "2005-10-31T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1205990"}, {"content": "Why is For a Few Dollars More one of the greatest movies of all time?

Basically, a \"Man with No Name\", known by some as Manco (Clint Eastwood), is a bounty hunter, a profession shared by a former army officer, Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef). Eventually, the two learn that ruthless, cold-blooded bank robber El Indio (Gian Maria Volont\u00e8) has been broken out of prison by his gang, and many of the jailers have been slaughtered. Indio carries a musical pocket watch, a flashback reveals that he took it from a young woman (Rosemary Dexter), who shot herself after he raped her and murdered her husband. The incident has haunted Indio, and he smokes an addictive drug to cloud his memory. Indio plans to rob the Bank of El Paso. The Stranger arrives in the town and becomes aware of Mortimer, they study each other and are initially resentful of each other. But as neither intends to back down they decide to work together. Mortimer persuades the Stranger to get closer to Indio by joining his gang. The Stranger achieves this by freeing a friend of Indio's from prison despite Indio's suspicions. Indio sends the Stranger and three others to rob the bank in nearby Santa Cruz. While the Stranger guns down the three bandits and rouses the sheriff (Tomas Blanco) and his posse, the gang manage to blast the rear wall of the bank and steal the safe but are unable to open it. Indio's gang member Groggy (Luigi Pistilli) is suspicious the Stranger is the only one to return from Santa Cruz, but thanks to a convincing wound from Mortimer, Indio believes the Stranger's version of events. The gang rides to the small border town of Agua Caliente where Mortimer is waiting. The hunchback Wild (Aguirre, the Wrath of God's Klaus Kinski), he is killed when a showdown ensues before Mortimer offers his services to Indio to crack open the safe. Indio locks the money in a strongbox and says that the loot will be divided after a month. Manco and Mortimer break into the strongbox and hide the money, only to be caught and beaten up. Mortimer has secured the strongbox lock, however, and Indio believes that the money is still there. Members of the gang, including Ni\u00f1o (Mario Brega) and Cuchillo (Aldo Sambrell), go against each other to get their hands on the money, whilst Mortimer and the Stranger are freed. Indio convinces Groggy to join forces with him to trap the bounty killers. The next morning, the Stranger and Mortimer shoot down the gang, one by one, in the streets of the town, and Mortimer kills Groggy when he tries to flee. The Stranger sits while Mortimer and Indio have a standoff. The Stranger notices the photograph inside the pocket watch is of the young woman seen in the earlier flashback, it is revealed that it is Mortimer's sister. The showdown ends with Mortimer shooting and killing Indio, and with his vengeance complete, he declines to take any share of the reward for his death. It ends with the Stranger riding away into the distance with his horse towing the wagon full of the lifeless bodies of the entire gang. Also starring Benito Stefanelli as Luke \"Hughie\", and Mara Krupp as Mary, the Hotel Manager's Beautiful Wife. Eastwood as the iconic \"Man with No Name\" remains cool, looking steely eyed in his poncho, smoking cigars, it is said most of his dialogue was cut to make him more mysterious, this sequel helped to continue his international superstardom. The film does have lip-sync and dubbing issues, the story is very up-and-down and slow at times, but for Eastwood, brilliant use of extreme close-ups, the tense showdown sequences, the violence, and the memorable score by Ennio Morricone, this is a fine classic western.

I think the first 'dollars' film suffered from the fact that its plot was stolen from Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo. This, however is a completely original movie and I'm very glad that it is. Some of Leone's trademarks, such as the use of a 'good' a 'bad' and an 'ugly' character are shown here for the first time. The surprise here is that this time around Clint Eastwood isn't actually the good one. Lee van Cleef might look sinister in his black clothes, his impressive weapons arsenal and really seems at first like the bad guy, but as the story progresses, we learn that he is, in fact, fighting for good reasons, unlike Clint who is only killing for money. El Indio is a very good bad guy, but not as memorable as Lee van Cleef and Henry Fonda would later be. See, I can't even remember the actor's name! There's not very much bad to say about this. The plot has enough twists to keep you interested, it has some great side characters (the hunchback, played by the craziest actor ever, Klaus Kinski and the old man living by the railroad come to mind), incredibly good music (Ennio Morricone could be the greatest movie composer ever!) and of course, Leone's ace directing (look at the cut from a laughing Indio to a wanted poster!).If I had to teach someone what a spaghetti western actually is, I would show this film. It's just a very good film compared to the absolutely brilliant the Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Once Upon a time in the West, but it isn't as epic as both of those films are, either. Highly recommended. ***** The Best Part (spoiler): The end duel might seem like a prototype to the one in the end of GB&U, but it's still brilliant with the use of the music box tunes and Ennio Morricones usual Spanish guitar and choir.

What makes a great western? While 'Unforgiven,' 'Dances With Wolves, 'The Wild Bunch' and 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' have lofty ideas, so does 'The Big Country,' and it's not a particularly great western. Personal westerns like 'The Hired Hand' and, particularly, 'Heartland' don't possess particularly lofty ideas, but they are great westerns. So what is it? I'm not sure there is an answer.What I do know is that I've seen 'For a Few Dollars More' eleven times, which is more than I've seen 'Unforgiven,' 'The Wild Bunch,' 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,' 'Once Upon a Time in the West' and 'Dances With Wolves' put together. Is it because 'For a Few Dollars More' is entertaining? It most certainly is, but so are these other films, especially 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.' I think I love 'For a Few Dollars More' so much because, in addition to being beautifully written, it shares that hallmark gimmick so beautifully executed in 'The Six Sense;' that being, magic. By magic I mean the art of distraction. In both cases, the story we are watching is so satisfying, we aren't expecting the twist at the end, even though it was always right under our noses.'For a Few Dollars More' is one of those rare sequels that's better than the original, 'A Fistfull of Dollars'. The only other great sequels that can make that claim are 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'The Godfather: Part II' . All three films succeed for the same reason: they use the audience familiarity with the characters and style to expand the storyline. Since we know at some point 'The Man With No Name' (Clint Eastwood) will show up, we can sit through the lengthy exposition which introduces two new main characters, 'The Man in Black' (Lee Van Cleef) and 'El Indio' (Gian Maria Volante). Both characters are compelling, Volante, especially. Indio is one of the darkest, vicious, tormented villains in the movies. Volante is so good we quickly forget he played the main villain, Ramon, in 'A Fistfull of Dollars. Van Cleef's bounty hunter, 'The Man in Black' is almost James Bondish with his assorted weapons and gadgets. However, Van Cleef's persona and looks gives the character a sense of suspenseful ambiguity. CAN this man in black be trusted? Eastwood's 'Man With No Name' is a more ruthless, treacherous character than he was in 'Fistfull of Dollars'. The opening scene, before the titles, shows and off-camera Eastwood bushwacking a bounty. Eastwood repeatedly betrays Van Cleef after the two bounty hunters join forces; he probably feels compelled to do so because 'The Man in Black' is consistently one step ahead of him. Leone takes great care contrasting the styles of the two bounty hunters. When Van Cleef researches Eastwood, he searches the newspapers until finding an article with a picture of the closing scene in 'Fistfull of Dollars; this establishes 'The Man in Black' as a more cerebral, systematic professional; it also reminds the audience of the first movie. When Eastwood researches Van Cleef, 'The Man With No Name' goes to see an old gossip, 'Prophet'. The scene between 'Prophet' and 'No Name' is initially funny; Leone does this to loosen up the audience, so Prophet's story about 'The Man in Black' is more affecting. 'Mortimer. Colonel Douglas Mortimer,' Prophet says, with a touch of sadness. 'The Man in Black' is genteel Southern aristocracy, a war hero, who's life dramatically changed over one tragic incident. Prophet doesn't tell us what that incident is, and it's mentioned only once by Eastwood and Van Cleef before the surprising climax of 'For A Few Dollars More'. While Leone establishes his dark villain 'Indio' as a sadistic psychopath, he and Volante create a character of surprising melancholy. An tragic incident, revealed by a series of increasingly descriptive flashbacks reveals Indio's life and happiness has been forever changed. Indio doesn't feel remorse for the incident; such a animal is incapable of guilt. Instead, Indio feels a great sense of loss, a loss so emotionally wrenching, Indio stays doped-up in order to endure.Indio plans to rob the bank of El Paso, and 'No Name' and Mortimer plan to capture him and his gang for the bounty. The robbery is a masterwork of editing comparable to the shower scene in 'Psycho'. Indio and his gang escape and 'No Name' and Mortimer set out after them. Mortimer has a genuine affection for 'No Name'. Just as well, since it's obvious Mortimer could easily kill 'No Name'. To reveal more would spoil the fun and there is a great deal of fun to be had in 'For a Few Dollars More.'Leone died at the age of 60, too young for such a man of genius. He directed only 13 films, three of which are bonafide masterpieces, 'For a Few Dollars More,' 'The Good, The Bad & The Ugly' and 'Once Upon a Time in the West'. Those three films were made within an astonishing 36 months. While both 'Once Upon a Time in the West' and 'The Good, The Bad & The Ugly' have grander themes (and much bigger budgets), neither is as well focused and surprising as 'For a Few Dollars More'. I give 'For a Few Dollars More' a '10'.Reading about Leone at the IMDb website, I was astonished to discover that two of his western films were never fully released in the US, 'The Magnificent Stranger' and 'The Genius'. Would somebody PLEASE put these movies on DVD? Leone permanently transformed the face of the American western.

The old west was such a minefield for film-making. It's really amazing. Old west stories take on such epic proportions because good vs. bad was so clearly delineated. Life was simpler, everyone owned a gun. Western tales are archetypal.It was really nice having Kinski in a spaghetti western. A little surreal. I didn't realize it the first time around. And I appreciate the dubbing. It adds a hyper real quality that accentuates the cartoony feel of the whole enterprise. Leone films are truly original. This was my second time around with this one, and although the pace was a little slow for me to stay totally focused, I enjoyed the music; the whistling; the haunting melody of the watch.

Throughout the movie, ruthless bounty hunters, all of who seem to have no respect for human life, often perform cold-blooded murders. The bounty hunters use the \"wild west\" as a free range: they track, they kill, and they collect.One of these bounty hunters happens to be The Man with No Name (Eastwood), who returns to us now after his introduction in \"A Fistful of Dollars,\" which was the first movie of the trilogy. (An interesting observation is that the \"man with no name\" actually does have a name in each installment -- here, his name is Manco, but this is a fact that is often forgotten.)The Man with No Name/Manco is on a mission to find the criminal Indio (Gian Maria Volont\u00e9), whose capture is worth a large sum of money. It is quickly set up that local law enforcement is weak. Sheriffs are cowards. Only the vicious bounty hunters know how to drag in the criminals: dead or alive. Along for the journey is a fellow bounty hunter named Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef), whose own reasons for seeking the man differ from Manco's. At first, the two killers go their own separate ways, and then decide to team up together and improve their chances of finding Indio -- despite the fact that their intentions for his capture are different.Not only are the two men's intentions different, but also their methods. Mortimer is a ruthless, cold-blooded murderer whose self-confidence is revealed through his barbaric actions. Manco, the hero, is less of a murderer and more of a law enforcer. Leone quickly sets this up through a sequence of shots: Mortimer's introduction, for example, begins with his search for a criminal, which finally comes to a finish as Mortimer confronts the man (who is hiding in a brothel). His foe manages to escape through a window, leaping onto a horse and galloping away through town. The images that follow reveal an insight into Mortimer's own self-confidence and startlingly calm nature.Manco's appearance is even more dramatic. He tracks down his own victim, and corners him in a saloon, only to see three cowboys appear out of nowhere and block off all exits. In one quick motion he swings around and fires three successive shots, each bullet finding its target.Here it is established that Manco is an underdog; therefore, our story's hero. He isn't as ruthless as Mortimer (who mercilessly picks his prey off from a distance) and his actions are somewhat admirable. The cowboys who tried to kill him were the bad guys. Manco was the good guy.Its lesser admirers often describe the film as being \"too long\". It's true that the film contains some unnecessary scenes, and these are often dragged out for dramatic effect -- but that is the point. The movie, directed by one of cinema's most ambitious and visionary directors (Sergio Leone, 1929 - 1989), is all about long passages of close-ups and wide-lense shots. Along with its predecessor and particularly its sequel, the \"Dollars\" trilogy revolutionized the derogatory \"spaghetti western\" description. In the years to come, Hollywood would actually aim to create films similar to the \"Dollars\" movies -- all of which were inferior. The entire \"Dollars\" trilogy has such scope, and ambition, that its Hollywood counterparts pale in comparison.Leone's direction is magnificent and would later inspire -- of all people -- Quentin Tarantino (whose \"Kill Bill\" movies owe something to the \"Dollars\" trilogy). Long, wide lenses and extreme close-ups only accentuate the fear of the men. There is a particular sequence of shots that clips back and forth between Mortimer and a wanted notice pinned to the exterior of a building. Leone slowly builds up the back-and-forth shots until they burst into a pattern of super-speed images, distinctly closed with the sound of gunshots. It's this sort of blazing, distinct style that makes the film so infectious and enjoyable.The acting cannot be criticized, although the English dubbing is sometimes rather laughable. Eastwood is one of the only actors whose voice is not dubbed -- but he rarely speaks. His face does all the talking. Lee Van Cleef (who was re-cast by Leone as a separate character in \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\") manages to turn Mortimer into one of the quintessential bad guys of cinema. Although the dubbing can occasionally detract from the flow of scenes and dialogue, the two lead performances by Eastwood and Van Cleef more than compensate for this slight flaw.Hollywood was cautious about releasing \"Dollars.\" Eastwood, known for his role in the television series \"Rawhide,\" was the only marketable star. The director was an unknown Italian with no commercial successes. As its predecessor before it, \"For a Few Dollars More\" was delayed release in the States, where it was deemed \"unworthy.\"However, the movie was a huge success in Italy, in particular; Clint Eastwood quickly gained a cult fan base overseas, but it was not until May 1967 -- after the US release of \"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\" -- that \"For a Few Dollars More\" and its predecessor would open to critical accolade and deserved celebration in the United States.

GBU is the masterpiece, but you can't watch a masterpiece movie as much as B movies. \"Dollars More\" is better for constant viewing. Many people felt the plot wasn't as good a \"Fistful\", (and it wasn't), but I had already seen Yojimbo, which \"Fistful\" gets it's plot from. So everything done in \"Fistful\" was something I'd already seen. Plus Fistful has it's slow parts....sorry it just does. Also, I like the score in \"Dollars More\" better. Once again it's the perfect middle ground between \"Fistful\" and GBU. The GBU score has been overused and \"Fistful\"'s score doesn't give as much emphasis like \"Dollars More\" gives. Especially, the two showdowns with Indio. The music couldn't be done any better. The bells melody mixed with the other elements was perfect for both scenes. Given Indio a melody played by the cathedral organ then using the same melody for Lee Van Clef but with a trumpet show the contrast between good and evil that most non-music people would miss.

Two bounty hunters, one played by Clint Eastwood, the other by Lee Van Cleef (who was \"the bad\" in 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'), work together to get an outlaw. They each have their motives, both are not really people you can trust, both are great with their guns.With Leone it is not really what is happening but how it is presented to the viewer. Often shown with close-ups of sweaty faces Leone knows how to create suspense in a gun fight where you can predict the outcome because Eastwood is in it. But not only Leone deserves credit for this movie, or actually the complete trilogy. Eastwood is in his element here and he makes sure the choice of greatest western star is not necessarily John Wayne. Van Cleef, who normally plays real villains, is terrific here as what seems to be a good guy. Another memorable thing is Ennio Morricone's score. Although his most famous scores are from 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' and 'Once Upon a Time in the West' he also adds something to the atmosphere in this movie (and of course 'A Fistful of Dollars').

If it's not as great as the third film, \"The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly,\" it's still one of the most brilliant westerns, spaghetti or otherwise, ever made.The plot this time is more convoluted than it was the first time out, in \"A Fistful Of Dollars.\" A bounty hunter who goes by the name \"Monco\" (Eastwood) gets on the trail of a crazed killer named Indio (Gian Maria Volante) and his gang, only to find another bounty hunter, Col. Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef), is just as close, and even more intent on collecting the reward for Indio's demise.The mood of the spaghetti western, that of a world where life being cheap except for those who collect money for taking it, is firmly established early on, where we witness a seemingly random killing during the opening credits, followed by several more courtesy of Monco and the Colonel. Monco at least seems willing to try to take his prey back alive, whereas the Colonel is less fussy. Director Sergio Leone made an effective vehicle with \"Fistful Of Dollars,\" one that launched Eastwood as a major star, but it is here he begins to make the case for a complex vision of the western as an existential stage for man's villainy, glory, and doom all at once.Calling it a spaghetti western makes it sound cheap. Sure, it's Italian, but if you have to note the country of origin, wouldn't it be better to call it a \"horse opera?\" The long, drawn-out pauses that establish mood, the way different parts create their own tone which meld seamlessly into the next, the complications in the unfolding of the narrative that set up exciting alternatives to audience expectations, the sense of divine judgment in a world where the existence of divinity itself seems in question, and finally that incredible Morricone score (much more diversified than we heard in \"Fistful,\" with some recognizable melodies and nice use of off-tones like the harmonica and that everpresent Jew's harp) all point to something with the heft and scale of Verdi. It's a western unlike anything that came before.Another welcome development is the humor. We got bits of that in \"Fistful,\" like Clint's reaction when he slugs a woman by mistake, but here there's some sections where the audience is encouraged to laugh even as the foreboding, alien mood of death and grief is being established. Like Manco's brief moment with the old man, \"Prophet,\" which has some nice eye-rolling from the tight-faced gunman; and the memorable match-lighting moments between Van Cleef and a nasty little hunchback played by Klaus Kinski. (Sauerkraut western?) Even Indio cracks wise on occasion, as when Cuchillo discovers where his knife went. \"That shouldn't be there, should it?\" he asks, almost innocently, though with appropriate menace.There are some logic gaps in the storyline, though they are not as distracting on repeat viewings as the ones in \"Fistful.\" Volante has some effective moments as Indio, but then he goes over the top in other scenes. I think letting him wear the Adam Ant eyeliner in prison was a mistake, and so is an odd section of Morricone's score early on where he throws in some \"Dracula\" organ music. These are quibbles, and not enough for me to deny that it's my favorite Leone western. But taking a broader view, it's not as good as \"The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly,\" with the important insertion of Tuco's character, the Civil War backdrop, and a more effective and deliberate focus on the role of God in such a world as this. But if few movies of any kind are as good as `The Good, Bad, And Ugly,' this is a stirring establishment of the themes that film would work very hard and well at resolving.The best thing in this film is the relationship between Eastwood's character and Van Cleef's. It's a dance of distrust, and as much as Monco sets himself up as the antagonist, you have to wonder what the preternaturally poised Col. Mortimer has up his sleeve. Is he really playing it the way he says? Clearly he has some hidden motive, and given Van Cleef's sinister, devil-like visage, so effectively set up in the early scenes, you can't really blame Monco for his suspicions. All this is in the way of setting up one of the most satisfying resolutions in any western, where Leone makes his case for a director worthy of John Ford's heavy mantle.Has it really been 40 years since this came out? Funny this was the offspring of a Kurosawa imitation, since as a '60s icon, the No Name trilogy has become imitated on a scale second only to the Beatles.

All I can say is that this movie is certainly unpredictable.And it is executed perfectly by Leone's wonderful style. His long pauses, haunting music (compliments of Ennio Morricone) and use of gunshot noise whenever a major plot point is revealed may seem campy on paper, but anyone who sees this film will certainly change their mind.That's just the director, the three leads all put forth too. Eastwood gives what I think is his best performance of the trilogy, we get our best look at his otherwise cold, callous character. Cleef is great too, his character is so cool and much more likable than his \"The Bad\".But Volonte, he does the best. If this movie was released in America and not dubbed he would have no doubt garnered an Oscar nomination.

And yet, occasionally there are those who'll not even know this film from Leone and Clint exists since it does sometimes get under the shadow of their two most infamous works, Fistful of Dollars (which for the most part introduced Clint and Leone to the public's awareness) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (which solidified Clint as a Western icon and gave Leone a similar status for film buffs). But taken as a film unto itself, aside from its place in the trilogy, this is a Western that simply delivers the goods, and it does so with a spectacular marriage of style and substance. The story begins by introducing our two (anti) heroes, bounty hunters Douglas Mortimer (Cleef), former Colonel, and Monco (Eastwood), a drifter. They both set their sights on the leader of a gang of bandits named Indio (Volonte), who is plotting to go after over a million locked in a bank in El Paso. At first, Monco and Mortimer seem like their after Indio for the same reason- reward money- though there seems to be more than each man counted on with him and his gang. From the opening scenes with Cleef and Eastwood, to the scenes in El Paso, and then into the set pieces in the stone ruins in the Mexico desert(s), For a Few Dollars More displays the utmost skill by Leone in his storytelling, as well as in his use of the camera. Using Fistful's camera-man Massimo Dallamano, Leone does what he does best in his spaghetti westerns- he creates a perfectly in sync mood with his characters: each look in a scene, whether it's intense waiting for guns to be drawn, or just regular conversation, the look of the film draws the viewer in without over-doing it. Some points are made bold or repetitious (like Ennio Morricone's score, that keeps its whistling theme and serene watch theme completely in check), though it's not done to any degree of annoyance or by accident. In fact, that's what makes his westerns such fun, is that you take them seriously as films, yet he always reminds you that it's all in the 'movie-world' just by the way Mortimer or Monco strikes up a match. As for the actors themselves, Eastwood and Cleef are total pros in this genre, so ever line of dialog comes out naturally, and the supporting actors (however dubbed over from original Italian) all contribute great notes as well.

The premise has similarities to that of the first, and in fact won't be all that surprising to most younger viewers. But at the time, the various plot turns and twists were unique and revolutionary. The pace is both a pro and con at the same time. Unlike modern films, the usual western showdown scenes unfold very deliberately. Rather than simultaneously begin and end in a furious volley of bullets, the encounters are set up slowly. On the bright side, this gives both the characters and the viewers an opportunity to fully appreciate the choices made and the consequences that will follow. From a negative perspective (not mine), one might say that the gunfights are plain slow, and the action is too sparse. While I enjoyed the change of pace, I also understand why some will say otherwise. Others portions of \"More\" can hang with any western sequences ever put on film. Highlighting the action is a robbery scene, the creativity of which ranks with any modern heist out of \"The Score\" or \"The Italian Job.\"This trilogy catapulted Clint Eastwood to Hollywood fame, and one can see his star-making charisma ooze through the screen. Blending stoicism and machismo wonderfully, Eastwood produces the epitome of the tough and arrogant loner cowboy. In a role that could easily have been overshadowed, Van Cleef holds his own against Eastwood. His character was probably similar to Eastwood's in his youth, but Van Cleef accurately reflects the wisdom that would likely come with his character's age. The motley crew of baddies is filled with men who completely look their parts. That's about all that is asked of them, and they deliver. The cinematography of \"More\" follows in the groundbreaking footsteps of \"Fistful.\" While one might not notice anything revolutionary now, at the time shots like that had scarcely been seen. Shots like the low-angles utilized prior to a few shootouts, as well as the framing of space are all now staples of cinematic westerns, and they originated here.\nEnnio Morricone's score is also a classic. Whether serving as epic background music for sweeping crane shots or providing aural cues during action sequences, the music is always appropriate and often the best part of the film. Bottom Line: While it might not seem as great now, so much of this movie was groundbreaking and remains classic that it merits 8 of 10.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 67, "votes": 87}, "heading": "A classic in every aspect.", "date": "2003-10-15T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0090457"}, {"content": "The second film from Sergio Leone in his \"Nameless Man\" trilogy is probably my favorite of the three.

But when I keep on mentioning \"For a Few Dollars More\" (English title), people to not follow me in the same way. These two Leone-movies have many differences, but they still have something in common. Booth has the excitement and the hard core mood that I seldom find in other movies.The story: The film might seem thin \u0096 but keeps into it's own core. Instead of focus on too much story, Leone's direction, the set design, the costumes, the presence of the actors and Morricone's music gets in focus and creates an unforgettable masterpiece and one of the most entertaining movies ever. A Western like this doesn't need more story than it has.The storytelling: The film starts with the presentation of colonel Douglas Mortimer, reading in the bible on a train which he stops by his own hand ... the next scene contains 'The Return' of the man with no name ... wee see Clint Eastwood walking through the rain at the side of his horse, lighting a cigar before he enters a smoke-filled saloon. These first eminent scenes contains superb duels, and in spite of the fact that they are long, they have the highest suspense and tempo with booth silence and Morricone's pumping music combined with typical Leone-exaggerated sound effects which steals your whole attention. The presentation of the three main characters takes almost 30 minutes. Slow and boring? I found these 30 minutes to be the best part of this film and this excellent start of the movie makes it a classic in the Western AND in the Action genre! After this amazing start, the tempo becomes a bit slower but the rest of the movie is still a masterpiece...The heroes: The man with no name (Clint Eastwood) is harder than ever \u0096 Clint is at his best from start to end. Than we have Lee van Cleef, in his best performance, as Douglas Mortimer. He is VERY cool and mean here. Forget about the sequel \"The Good, The Bad and the Ugly\" (English title). This is his best role. Lee is superb as the former colonel, a relaxed and smart hero in black clothes, wearing lots of weapons ...The villains: A filthy, evil, rotten, bloodthirsty Gian Maria Volent\u00e9 is El Indio (not as handsome as in \"A fistful of Dollars\" (English title) but just as powerful and even more menacing) and he has a bunch of bandits where Klaus Kinski, Mario Brega and Luigi Pistilli makes great performances as really tough and bad guys. Just watching Luigi Pistilli in his best shape and a truly spectacular Klaus Kinski can make anyone satisfied.The direction: When it comes to Leone himself this is one of his most personal and stylish directions. No other movie has succeeded to imitate this perfect film. It is not just an Italian Western. This is a fast-paced action-movie. It is loud, fast and mean. Sergio Leone's camera ... with his close ups, the perfect editing, the never-ending pans ... the loud noise from the pistols and the riffles ... and the screams of dying desperadoes.The music: Ennio Morricone has made many good soundtracks, but I think that this is his best together with the one in \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" (English title). They are two different kinds of Morricone-soundtracks; this is the tough one, the other more operatic and in classic style.The trilogy: The other Dollar-movies misses the pace and speed of this one. This Dollar-movie has the toughest action scenes.

Combined with exciting shootouts, Leone's trilogy made movie history and remains compelling cinema.Arguably the best of the Leone trilogy is this second installment, a sequel to A Fistful of Dollars. Contrary to the nickname, Clint Eastwood's character does indeed have a name - identified as Joe in Fistful, here he is identified as Monco. And he also has an equally ruthless and skilled rival in Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef in his finest performance). Indeed, the theme of the film is the rivalry of the two bounty hunters turning to mutual respect and eventually to teamwork, shown in the climatic showdown with the villianous Indio, a brutal killer (perhaps a bit too brutal for the film's own good) with whom Mortimer has a score to settle, a score that becomes clear in the haunting chimes of the watches owned by both Mortimer and Indio.

There are excellent action set pieces which keeps the dialogue and story flowing nicely in the just over two hour running period. Highly recommended, so try For A Fistful of Dollars and The good the bad and the ugly too.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "If there's gonna be any shooting I've gotta have my rest.", "date": "2002-04-18T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0090429"}, {"content": "\"For a Few Dollars More\" has become the template for which most Spaghetti Westerns derive. As Leone went along, his films got more daring and complex, exploring new ideas and raising not only the bar for Spaghetti Westerns (which, contrary to popular belief, were around before \"A Fistful of Dollars\") but for Westerns in general. However, this exploration at times affected the quality of his films. Leone was a popcorn director - a visual stylist who always entertained first and maybe provoked a thought or two second. However, his films were never think pieces so when he tried to integrate depth into his films the results became uneven. \"For a Few Dollars More\" is his best film because it catches Leone in his most transitional period. At once the film is more complex and stylized than \"A Fistful...\" and more tight and efficient than \"The Good, the Bad and The Ugly\" (which is almost on par with \"For a Few...\"). The revenge sub-plot involving Colonel Mortimer is more compelling than the similar one in Leone's \"Once Upon a Time in the West\" because Mortimer is more developed as a character than the Harmonica Player (which is not to insult the great Charles Bronson). And hell, it has Lee Van Cleef as one of the biggest bad-asses of all time. The mere presence of Colonel Douglas Mortimer elevates the film to a new level. He steals the film from \"Manco\" completely. And Van Cleef's theft of the film is what makes it a cut above \"A Fistful...\". As a character, \"The Man With No Name\" (who in actuality has three: Joe, Manco and Blondie) isn't very interesting and there always needs to be a counterpoint to play off of him. That's why \"A Fistful...\" isn't nearly as good as this film or \"The Good...\" (which had the great Eli Wallach in one of the best scenery munching performances ever).So in closing, \"For a Few...\" is a tight masterpiece of fluff Western entertainment.

(\"Fistful,\" along with several other films in recent memory, is derived from the Japanese director's 'lone samurai' tale, \"Yojimbo.\")\nBut if Leone cannot compete with Kurosawa's storytelling genius (who himself had help from Ryuzo Kikushima and Dashiel Hammett) he was carving out his own unique niche in cinematic history.Here, the basic, irresistible elements of the \"Spaghetti Western\" -- Ennio Morricone's spare, knowing and highly dramatic score, Clint Eastwood's inscrutable half-eyed glare, the nearly comic circus-show gunplay -- familiar as a worn-in pair of boots to the great majority of American Sunday afternoon TV viewers, are solidified and put on full display.And they are unquestionably entertaining.By now parodied, emulated, and simply ripped off for decades, Leone, at the time, had managed to breathe new life (and death) into a genre that was fading at the hands of cinematic oversaturation -- just how many times could the same tale be told? -- and the advent of half-hour Western \"teleplays\".\nEastwood's performance is essentially perfect, his presence as distinct as the noon sun over the desert sky, and Lee Van Cleef is a worthy foil. Gian Maria Volont\u00e9, the Italian actor who appears as the main (but different) villain in \"Fistful,\" is a greasy, psychotic sadist who the scenery chewing maniacs in modern films seem to owe a debt to. The rest of the characters are drawn with similar wide strokes. (While Eastwood's \"heroes\" are often called amoral -- an assertion that doesn't really hold up under close scrutiny -- the supporting players are either pointing a gun at you, or with you. Look for Klaus Kinski as the \"hunchback.\")The dialogue, although it appears to have been filmed in English, is poorly re-dubbed, but nonetheless witty and terse, punctuated by some stunning heat-baked photography. (If after you learn that these films were not shot in the States it becomes impossible for you to see anything but the parched sands of Spain, surely you will agree that the territory lends a powerfully sinister feel to the film. Leone's greatest strength may have been that he seemed to set his Westerns on a slightly different planet than our own.)\nThe film's main flaw -- and I can already hear the noir enthusiasts moaning -- is that there are a few too many twists and turns down the dusty trails, and slightly weary viewers may lose the satisfaction when the inevitable \"moment of reckoning\" arrives at the end of the film.\nOverall, this is a very good film -- fans of more modern films might liken the differences between \"Fistful\" and \"A Few Dollars More\" to those between Robert Rodriguez's low-budget debut \"El Mariachi,\" and his Hollywood remake, \"Desperado.\" Both are worthy films, but the grit of the original is more satisfying.It is important to note that Leone hit both marks -- realism and big-budget spectacle -- with the incredible \"Once Upon A Time In The West.\"", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 7}, "heading": "Cartoon-like epic western with something for everyone", "date": "2001-06-03T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0090419"}, {"content": "This is the best of the \"Man with No Name Trilogy \" , and also one of the best Clint Eastwood Westerns .

This is slightly understandable, since it's just a hair below the impossibly good standards of `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' and `Once Upon a Time in the West' (among others), but there's no denying that `For a Few Dollars More' is still a terrific movie in its own right. In fact, if judged on its own merits instead of in comparison to Leone's other works, it's nearly a classic.`For a Few Dollars More' pretty much picks up right where `A Fistful of Dollars' left off \u0096 the Man With No Name (Clint Eastwood), who's now been dubbed `Manco' by a couple of his fellow bounty hunters, is working his way through the Old West, systematically picking off and collecting the reward for despicable criminals and other lowlifes. He's worked his way up to hunting down the most ruthless bandit of them all, Indio (the incredibly underrated Gian Maria Volont\u00e9), a depraved killer who's recently escaped from prison. Also on the hunt for Indio, however, is the bounty hunter Colonel Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef), who has a personal score to settle with the killer. The film becomes an interesting three-way game of cat and mouse, as Colonel Mortimer and the Man With No Name struggle to work around (and with) each other, as well as to hunt down Indio, who's decided he's not going to be taken down without a fight.Eastwood's portrayal of The Man With No Name really getting to flourish for the first time in this film \u0096 there's glimpses of it in `A Fistful of Dollars', but this is the first time it becomes apparent how weirdly moral the Man With No Name is. He can be a bloodthirsty, brutal bully at times, but he only acts that way around people he thinks deserve to knocked down a peg or two. To women, children (at least the ones that try to steal from him), and others he considers to be `innocent', the Man With No Name is surprisingly deferential, even kind. There's a lot of complexity to the character, and Eastwood pulls it off with some serious style.Van Cleef is also great as Colonel Mortimer, although it's weird to see him in this film as Mortimer and then in `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' as the dastardly Angel Eyes \u0096 the two characters are such complete opposites. Mortimer is a lot like the Man With No Name \u0096 adhering to a strange code of honor, doing heroic things by often unheroic methods. Because of their similarities, the relationship between the two characters is terrific, veering between complete distrust and grudging respect. In a way, `For a Few Dollars' more is one of the first modern `buddy' action movies \u0096 the way Eastwood and Van Cleef interact with each other seems eerily like the predecessor to movies like `Lethal Weapon' and `48 Hours'.Director Sergio Leone does a great job with this film as well \u0096 the initial meeting between The Man With No Name and Colonel Mortimer is appropriately tense, bordering on near film perfection. So are the scenes with Indio and his gang (watch Indio's storytelling explanation about how he plans to rob a bank), as well as the final confrontation between all the characters -- awesome. Leone also uses the score of Ennio Morricone to great effect, using a haunting little tune from Indio's pocket watch to great effect throughout the film. The pacing, the backgrounds, the shot set-ups \u0096 all awesome. Leone's one of the unappreciated film greats of all time.`For a Few Dollars More' is simply a fantastic film; if you haven't already seen this one, rent it immediately. The only reason people don't rave about this as being one of the best Western of all time is because it fell between two cracks of Western perfection: `A Fistful of Dollars' and `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly'.Grade: A", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 5, "votes": 7}, "heading": "Often Overlooked, But Still Phenomenal", "date": "2001-05-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0090417"}, {"content": "We're talking about a definite member of the top three spaghetti westerns, starring two supercool heroes (personally just looking at Lee van Cleef's face I say that this guy is da man).

The violence and the dry humour is still there but the camera seems to pan out a whole lot more while the characters have more time to evolve into something more tangible than from FOD.We can also see from this film Leone's gradual development into producing more than just a shoot-out western. Very gradually each scene seems to have a rhythm & mood all of its own that somehow doesn't seem right for a typical western. But Leone wants to move us away from this typical norm and educate us a little further so that our idea of a western is no longer imagined on the lines of High Noon or The Searchers. Leone is perhaps one of only a dozen decent directors who has the talent & imagination to use the musical score to either enhance a scene or generate more pathos from it. Here he uses this technique only sparingly (the pocket watch duel being the prime example of this). And yet by the time he directed Once Upon A Time in the West, Morricone's haunting score is used more & more frequently to further enhance & emotionally charge the scene in question.FAFDM is quite good for what it is, but lacks a certain clarity & direction, which isn't a complaint as such but perhaps Leone was trying for too many new ideas concurrently while living off a meagre budget. Although to be fair he soon repairs the damage in the third and best of the Dollar westerns where he is given the time & money to live out his ideas to the full.As for Eastwood, well he still doesn't get round to saying very much which although doesn't hurt his kinetic performance it does make him a trifle wooden & staid at times. Van Cleef gives a more pointed & emotional performance as the elder bounty hunter of the two and perhaps takes the overall honours in the film. Overall For a Few Dollars More can be seen more as a development post for Leone's considerably crafted talents. It's also quite a good western but it might be an idea to give this a miss and move on to the superior Good, Bad & the Ugly.***/*****", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Leone, makes my day once again!", "date": "2000-08-26T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0090436"}, {"content": "My favorite movie of all time, more than fifty viewings, each one better than the last, as all elements erupt in simple power, from desolate desert to marauding music to hard men in dusty boots with mean guns, all bravado cut lean across Clint and Indio and Lee Van Cleef whose lives are boiled to the basics of greed and violence where the blood runs between life and death.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 3}, "heading": "Classy Classic in Wild West of Spain", "date": "2000-08-14T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0090435"}, {"content": "Before giving a comment, let me introduce the film to the readers: in 1964, Italian Director Sergio Leone made `A Fistful Of Dollars' starring Clint Eastwood and (the gorgeous!) Gian Maria Volont\u00e9. A year later, Leone made `For A Few Dollars More', and, in 1966, his masterpiece `The Good, The Bad and the Ugly'. The 3 films are known as `the so-called Dollars trilogy'.I watched the films in the wrong order, but I must say that FAFDM is an archetypal `Spaghetti Western', a genre characterized by a deceivingly simple plot, few but ironic lines, absurd coincidences, and intense violence. In FAFDM, Gian Maria Volont\u00e9 and Lee Van Cleef gave a stunning performance, the former as a psychotic criminal, the latter as a cynical bounty killer. And, in the middle, the laconic man with no name (Clint Eastwood), another bounty killer, pairs up with either of the other two, depending on his interest.The soundtrack of that film, provided by the creative Ennio Morricone, was cleverly used to match the scenes. Watch out for the scene from the past where Volont\u00e9 rapes Van Cleef's sister, and for the crosscutting between Van-Cleef's eyes and Volont\u00e9's face in his \u0091wanted' portrait. And Eastwood counts Volont\u00e9's men in terms of how much money their heads are worth!That film is rather long, but highly creative and entertaining. I've watched it 3 times and will watch it a 100 times again.If you're looking for THE Spaghetti Western, `For A Few Dollars More' would be it.

Don't get me wrong, it's still full of funny and madness, but there are few explosions of ecstatic violence, the rites here are most definitely those of death, a death which infects the whole land, as visualised in the hilarious, absurd opening scene, a fixed long shot of a lonely rider who is arbitrarily picked off. Life has no value in these parts. If FISTFUL was early Verdi, than this is Wagner, an astonishingly free consolidation and elaboration of themes, intricately worked out, a fusion of visual and musical leitmotifs, true music drama. If Peckinpah is balletic, than this is a suffocating tableau vivant (or mourant?).All the compelling contradictions and paradoxes of the Leone aesthetic are in full fruitful disjunction here. The tension between seriousness and mockery - on the one hand the film is given epic dignity and mythic scope. The haphazard nature of the sets might seem 'artificial', but so were settlements in those days, Leone giving the lie to manifest destiny. There is a quest, in keeping with the great Westerns (eg THE SEARCHERS), linked to family.On the other hand, the film is laced with parodic camp. Morricone's magnificent score is at its most unleashed here, comically intrusive at moments of apparent solemnity. The gleeful homoeroticism (eg Indio lighting his cigar from Monco's; the uproarious hat shootout, the hat being a traditional emblem of male sexual power; Mortimer's yummy fetishistic leather boots), undermines the macho posturing, in Monco's case again linked to sexual abstinence. The film is full of bizarre one-liners, double-takes that seem addressed to the audience, berserk compositions, angles and editing, vaudevillian bits of business that constantly distract us from the issue at hand. And what that issue might be is obfuscated until the closing ritual, a dress rehearsal for UGLY's astonishing finale, so that it is easy to be distracted. The motif of the tinkling watches is, typically, as silly as it is evocative.Further, there is a great emphasis on the theatrical, which wrenches the viewer out of the action at hand, into a consideration of role playing. Mortimer is pure theatre, as he makes his entrance from the stopped train, the proscenium arch of the carriage, or has his own musician scoring his actions in the first saloon scene.Nothing fits in MORE This is Leone's most dreamlike film, as his lonely ciphers travel back and forth over a vast, empty terrain, like dream figures. Even sites of potential life - saloons, trains, brothels etc. - are eerily underpopulated, and if the settlements they arrive in aren't ghost towns, they are when they leave. The film is full of circular dream logic, random, elliptical - the final exit of Monco carting the dead is brilliantly surrealist.And yet, the film is vividly tangible in a way traditional Westerns never were (except maybe Mann, Leone's most obvious influence): you can feel the creaking wood, the interior decor, the sun-parched land - Leone's style, describing a world of Darwinian viciousness yet geometrically beautiful, deliberately intrudes on people and things, as if the camera is about to touch them.Once again, these contradictions converge on Clint's character. He is, as in FISTFUL, seemingly an abstract figure, an inviolable Grim Reaper shearing his way through Biblically arid lands. Even as the film progresses, and relationships are forged, Monco remains an enigma. Mortimer is linked to family, Indio to his friends - both relations are characterised by rupture and betrayal, motivating their actions. Monco has none, not even the tantalising intimation given in FISTFUL.But, in contrast to his abstraction or distance, his very human vulnerability is revealed in a ritualistic beating, as in the first film; his beautiful body pulverised, on public display. His gaze is less powerful in this film, less organising, as you might expect when he is on the sidelines to a quest he doesn't understand. His expert gunplay is less inexplicable, 'supernatural'.He also seems the most human of the three (that Leone triangle again); he is no longer the mysterious stranger in the series - this is Mortimer, whose unaccountable activities, aquiline face and morose hauteur are as unlikely to endear as Indio's strange, mentally befuddling, neurosis. That these latter are linked through family, past and death, against Monco is significant, but there might also be another opposition between 'old man' Mortimer, with his traditional, if more TERMINATOR-like, revenge quest, and 'boy' Monco's pointless capitalism, the Old West and the New (although Mortimer is linked to trains, which are shown, in a wonderful scene with a stubborn old landowner, to be the phantom power indifferent to these boy-boy rituals - soon to be dramatised in Leone's masterpiece). This is taken to a surprising conclusion in the mighty final part of the trilogy.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 4}, "heading": "One of the great sequels.(possible spoiler)", "date": "2000-06-28T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0090432"}, {"content": "One of my favorite movie lines of all time as spoken by Klaus Kinski upon recognizing Lee Van Cleef in the little cantina as the one who used his (Klaus') cheek to strike his match earlier in the movie.

I've been a Lee Van Cleef fan since High Noon (with Robert Wilke) and Kansas City Confidential (with Jack Elam and Neville Brand!) and this was/is the movie that made him a star. Granted it didn't last for long, but he did have his 15 minutes. This is my favorite Spaghetti Western, it was also my first (didn't see \"Fistful\" until much later - and Good, Bad, Ugly was a major disappointment - I wanted Van Cleef to play the same role).

This film has Clint portraying a bounty hunter of the old school-no partners, all for me-who ends up joining forces with a mysterious man in black, Colonel Mortimer, played by Lee Van Cleef. The two of them are hunting a vicious Mexican outlaw, El Indio, played by Gian Maria Volonte. Each has a distinct reason for wanting to capture the bandit; Clint has $10,000 dollars bounty money in mind, while Van Cleef is simply wanting to extract a personal degree of revenge upon the bandit.In the course of the film, the two actually join the gang, help pull off a bank robbery, then spend the time plotting how to get the gang members bumped off and collect the bounties on a whole passel of bad guys. Ultimately, the final shootout does occur with Van Cleef and Volonte staring each other down and Eastwood awaiting the outcome.A rather violent view of the west, but then, the characters portrayed were rather violent men, interested in personal revenge or \"For A Few Dollars More.\" A film favorite for those fans of Clint Eastwood, and a 9/10 on my personal scale.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "The Man with No Name is joined by the Man in Black to hunt for a bounty of dollars.", "date": "1999-04-11T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0090427"}, {"content": "Having taken his cue from High Noon, Leone fashioned a true revisionism of the western genre while at the same time establishing a sort of standard in the process as displayed in Fistful of Dollars.

Morricone's haunting score (as recognised in the pocket watch's melody) and Leone's attention to an evocative mise-en-scene combine together with a plot that moves the viewer from title to end with (dark)humor, tension and finally beauty.

The film involves one of the bounty killers (Eastwood) infiltrating the band of desperadoes in order to get their hands on the bounty on their heads while the other bounty killer (Van Cleef) follows his every move just in case he decides to leave him out of there 'deal'. What follows is a series of bank holdups, jailbreaks and the film climaxes with a stand off between the bounty killers and the evil bandit Indio.
