Barry's marvellous interplanetary memories are to be lost \"like tears in rain\" as are those of pre-literate societies such as Conrad's Congolese natives. Deckard like Marlowe is also arguably an unreliable narrator as he delivers past tense voiceover narration at moments in the film.

Emmett Walsh). His job is sounds simple, find and destroy four rogue androids, but these are highly dangerous - combat trained - machines. They are also as human as their manufactures could make them.The authorities are embarrassed by the Replicants, as they are called, return to Earth as they are only authorised for use Off World.Deckard hasn't encountered this series of robots, Nexus 6, so he is sent to Tyrell (Joe Turkell) who built them to find out more. There he meets and analyses Rachel (Sean Young), another Nexus 6 but a more advanced version with no concept that she is a robot and with a past. Implanted memories - dreams and so forth - convince Rachel she cannot be a replicant.But Deckard decides to use old fashioned detective work to find the four missing replicants. Leon (Brion James), Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), Pris (Daryl Hannah) and their leader, Roy (Rutger Hauer).A deadly chase ensues where Deckard may learn more about himself than he dared even dream.Okay, one of my absolute top favourite movies of all time, the first movie I bought on DVD and one I have in some many, many versions and formats.Obviously the description above generally services for all versions. As will, indeed, the following few paragraphs.Blade Runner set the tone in the early 80's for dark Sci Fi. An ambitious adaptation of a Phillip K Dick story \"Do androids dream of electric sheep\", the movie boasts excellent special effects, a gripping story arc and wonderful cast.The story is only loosely adapted from the source material, which I also I recommend to anyone interested in near future Sci-Fi, after all this is set in 2019 - not long now!Rutger Hauer and Harrison Ford are at their peak in this movie, both extracting everything from their characters, wringing the sponge dry as it were. Probably the highlight of Hauer's career.All the cast are well chosen, a personal favourite of mine is J F Sebestian, played by William Sanderson. Of course I love those wonderful toys he builds as his 'friends'. The idea of a genius that is so naive adds to the charm of the movie. Indeed, I think JF is the only character that comes across as requiring the sympathy of the viewer.Not that the plight of the Replicants is without its irony, sadness or sorrow.The setting, gloomy, futuristic and oppressive, is so massively enhanced by some of Vangelis's best work that the story has to be that much better to prevent the whole thing feeling like a complex, over-long electro-punk music video. Lucky that is the case, aided by the marvellous acting.A lot of the credit for this movie has to go to the astonishing vision of the director, Ridley Scott. The fact that the movie got finished (only due to a 27 hour stint on their last 'day' of filming) after tearing through its budget and then some is down to his force of will. That story can be explored in some detail in the documentary \"Dangerous Days\", which I reviewed earlier in the year.What you take from the movie is a personal 'journey', for several it proves the end of the line and there is a touch of noire to the whole thing. Is there such a thing as a happy ending.Depends which version you're watching.US Version\nThis version of the movie is available in the 5 disk Complete Collector's Edition.Only really important differences, as with the International Version, is the annoying voice-over and the happy ending. Interesting from a UK resident perspective to see how the two vary though.What it comes down to is that the US version is ever so slightly edited for violence.International Version\nThis version of the movie is available in the 5 disk Complete Collector's Edition.As with the US Version the only really important differences are the annoying voice-over and the happy ending.The International version has a little more blood and violence in key scenes, mainly in the Bradbury Building. Most viewers would feel the differences but wouldn't notice them directly.The Voice-Over\nCuriously, this was inserted into the movie at the insistance of the producers. The Previews, using the Workprint version reviewed earlier, gave feedback that the audience was struggling to understand the movie.Harrison Ford was there requested to perform the voice-over.*** Director's Cut ***\nThis version of the movie is available in the 5 disk Complete Collector's Edition. It is also available separately on DVD or iTunes or many, many other media. I myself have this version on iTunes, and several different DVD releases.In essence it is the Director's Cut version is a correction from the Theatrical versions, back to the concepts lain down by the rough Workprint version.The version is put together from notes left by Ridley Scott and indeed updated by him. He was not, however, directly involved in the post-production, being too busy on another project.The primary differences everyone will see or hear are the lack of voice-over and the removal of the \"Happy Ending\". The movie is cobbled together as a sort of re-edit with some elements are stolen from practically every previous version. For example, the more violent sequences from the International version are combined with the slightly different takes for the US version. For example, the \"not yet\" scene with Roy's hand.It is a pretty good version of the movie. The one I've watched so,so much over the years. The action flows much better and the feel of the movie that much better without the voice-over. The removal of the enforced ending means the cryptic ending lends strength to what has gone before.According to the commentary, the insertion of the unicorn scene wasn't quite what was intended but it still serves its purpose.The video quality is a little better, as I stated, as its on DVD after all. But it still looks a little VHS like. More grainy than is expected of a modern DVD, perhaps. But this was the very first DVD I bought!Rating: for so long the definitive version and certianly much closer to the original concept, very highly recommended*** The Final Cut ***\nThis version of the movie is available in the 5 disk Complete Collector's Edition. It is also available separately on DVD or iTunes or many, many other media. I myself have this version on iTunes, and of course on magnificent BlueRay.So we've already had the Director's Cut so why this version? Well, the previous version wasn't directly (sic) produced by Ridley Scott, rather from notes he gave his gifted editor.What we have here is what that should have been had the iconic director had the time.A lot of this version will be very familiar but, if you have it on DVD, you'll notice the dramatic improvement in the quality. If you have it on BlueRay you most certainly won't be disappointed. To say the print has been cleaned up is to give no justice to the team behind this.The audio is also improved - and in the more modern 5.1 surround format. All previous versions were stereo 2.0. Apparently they had this 5.1 audio all the time!Now onto the really interesting bits. On the Workprint disk in the Complete Collector's Edition there is the insightful \"All our Variant Futures\" documentary. This lays out in some detail the differences between The Final Cut and the previous versions.To pick out a few of differences that I think are particularly important, along with the clean ups mentioned before, we have a few refilmed sequences.Zhora's Death Scene\nRefilming of Zhora's death scene is the most complex sequence that's been changed. Originally a male stuntman performs the \"glass run\" scene through the arcade, shattering multiple sheets as Zhora tries to escape Deckard. The visual effect is the least convincing and most unrewarding of the movie as the actor is obviously not Joanna Cassidy.The actress herself was the first to promote the idea of refilming the scene, during an interview for the Dangerous Days documentary.What they eventually decided upon was a complex partial refilming and reintegration into the original sequence. The set was complex and setting it up all over again for this purpose, probably, inhibitively expensive. So the actress was asked to motion track the sequence, she moved her head and shoulders to the movements of the stunt double through the original sequence. Then the effects maestros go to work and integrate that set of new imagery onto the original. Indeed in the All our Variant Futures documentary there is a disturbing sequence where the body completes the whole scene with no head at all!Deckard Lip Sync\nDuring his investigations, Deckard gets tough with a snake saleman. In all the previous versions the visuals of the scene have no lip sync to the audio at all, giving a weird - surreal effect, like we are seeing some sort visualisation of the audio or perhaps another odd voiceover moment.What Ridley Scott has done for The Final Cut is use the same techniques as for Zhora's Death Scene to re-sync the lips. Harrison Ford was unable to participate so they got Ben Ford, his son, to perform the necessary visuals. Very effective it is too.Dove\nFinally, we have the removal of the blazing blue sky and a new background for the dove's ascent at the end of the Tears in Rain scene. This is a subtle change but beautifully done. Great care went into choosing which elements to keep and what to change.Overall\nI love all the previous versions but this has to be the definitive version, the one that the acting and vision deserved. Watch on BlueRay if you can, just let the movie take you to a disturbing (near) future, let Vangelis paint a musical picture in your mind. Let Ridley Scott drive you through an iconic detective story.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Many versions - all excellent in their own way", "date": "2023-04-15T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8994600"}, {"content": "I thought Blade Runner was a groundbreaking film when it was first released 41 years ago, and it still holds relevance today. Despite the fact that the graphics and pace of modern films have advanced significantly, the unique aesthetic of Blade Runner, which blends film noir with science fiction, is still impressive. That being said, I did have some issues with the film. The transitions between scenes were sometimes awkward, and I felt that the character development could have been handled better. Some character choices felt out of place, and it was hard to understand their motivations. Additionally, some of the content in the film, particularly the relationship between Deckard and Rachael, felt problematic by today's standards.That being said, what I enjoyed most about Blade Runner were the philosophical and existential questions it raised. The film made me think about the nature of memory, identity, and the ethics of creating and controlling artificial life forms. The replicants' struggle for autonomy and their eventual demise was particularly thought-provoking. My favorite moment in the film was when Roy saved Deckard's life, which highlighted the complexity of the replicants' emotions and their capacity for compassion.Overall, while Blade Runner may not be perfect, its themes and questions remain relevant and make it worth watching, especially for those who appreciate science fiction and philosophical musings.", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "A must watch for fans of science fiction", "date": "2023-04-11T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8986325"}, {"content": "This is one of the very few movies that gets better the more often you see it. It is a subtle movie. Slowly but surely this one has made it into the top 5 of my 'best movies of all time' list.I don't particularly care for the director's cut version, though. The inner monologue is missing - which gives you some of the most thought inspiring moments, and some of the added scenes downright make no sense at all. If I'd seen that one first I might never have given it a second chance.The cast is exceptional. Every one of them does a really fine job. Especially Rutger Hauer who otherwise has very few good movies to his name (maybe 'Day of the Falcon') delivers a stunning performance. Most of the cast who were unknown before this movie have moved on to fame (and some to fortune) - and rightfully so.From a technical point of view there is not much to criticize. More than 20 years later this movie still doesn't look dated (apart from 'Atari'-neon signs). The atmosphere is created with a lot of attention to detail, and the models of buildings are some of the most beautiful and believable ones I have ever seen.Now I recently read the book on which it is based ('Do androids dream of electric sheep' by Philip K. Dick). It's a quirky read and, frankly, not a very good book. It has too many plot holes, deus-ex-machina devices and logical inconsistencies, plus a total letdown of an ending.

Instead, Scott planned to film \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\" by cult writer Philip K Dick. If the director thought he was in for an easier job this time, he must have been disappointed.The movie follows a retired police officer (a so-called Blade Runner) who hunts down rogue androids who have illegally entered Earth.\"Blade Runner\", as the film was renamed, became an unusually grueling affair. There are countless reports of the many on-set bad feelings that plagued the production. The star, Harrison Ford, didn't like his co-star Sean Young, and the film crew had T-shirts made to express their anger over the brutal shooting schedule. But the worst part was that Harrison Ford and Ridley Scott didn't get along. Ford has rarely commented on the matter since filming was completed, except to remark that it was the toughest movie he had ever worked on.Ridley Scott credits the French magazine \"M\u00e9tal Hurlant\" as a stylistic mood source. Inspiration also came from the industrial landscape of his former hometown in northeast England. In addition, the picture has many similarities with Fritz Lang's masterpiece \"Metropolis\". In fact, Scott's effects supervisor used stills from the old silent movie when lining up the miniature building shots of \"Blade Runner\".With its mix of high tech and film noir, \"Blade Runner\" became a box office flop upon its initial run.

The gigantic pyramids with apartments, the very tall buildings, the chaotic closed scenes of metropolis cities are well placed. Flying cars are naturally expected elements of futuristic cities, 40 years after the film's release, they still don't exist.Too bad the development of the film does not please. The characters are not concatenated in a way that is of interest, a random amount of supporting fugitive robots is clearly evident for the plot to unfold. It could be better developed. The scene that could save the film did not, precisely the one in which the Machine finds the Creator and ends up killing him. It could be better detailed. As a deepening, I suggest the conversation between Bernand and the Director in the book Brave New World. The idea is the same, but well executed.The film becomes dull towards the end and the final fight scene lasts longer than it should, leading to boredom.The main character falling in love with the robot and them running away even though she had little time to live was an ending that pleased me, perhaps because of a spark of romance that still exists in me.I recommend the film, even if it unfolds slowly.

The book is amazing as well, but the few things that are done better in the movie are genius. First off, Isidore's character, J. F. Sebastian, having connection to the Tyrell Corporation is brilliant. Not only does it set up a shockingly violent moment for Roy to meet his maker, it also makes for more of a \"replicants are human\" statement.Roy and Pris want life, but after Roy realizes how doomed he is, he has a moment that leads to a glimpse of empathy. Yes, he has killed people and done things that the \"God of biomechanics\" wouldn't approve of, but the self realization of inevitable death triggers something human inside of him. Even after discovering Rick killed Pris, he still saves him as he's about to die. He connects with Rick as he's almost seconds away from dying. Roy sees the fear and, not only perceives it, understands it. Roy then decides to save him and gives a beautiful little monologue before shutting down. Brilliant.I will say that not including the electric animals and Mercer as more of a story driven element was a let down, although the approach on humanity is still deeply dived into. In the book, it's more of a one sided slaughter than a 1 on 1. Focusing more on Roy and his character development really had an effect on me. You can see the change in Roy and in Rick.As Rick runs away with his nexus-6 girlfriend, he sees an origami unicorn, the same one he was dreaming about. This shows, in my interpretation, that Rick is actually a Replicant. This makes it easier for him to see replicants and humans as not so different (both have levels of empathy). Thinking he was human and having inferior beliefs on Replicants throughout the film was perfect because it leads to such a drastic change in character. Rick can't have such beliefs anymore if he is what he thought he was superior towards.

A. some thirty years into the future, around now at the time of viewing nearly (2017).Much like other films most notably Back To The Future II it envisages a world of hovering cars, neon, electronic advertising of big corporations like Piccadilly Circus and Times Square and a dark, rainy city. The art direction of the film is from an era when the dreaded CGI of the later Star Wars films hasn't arrived thankfully and makes full use of models and miniature effects.For anyone that has watched Alien you will know of the human looking android character. I suppose this film follows 'replicants' like that. Ford doesn't dominate the film. His co-stars include replicant Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) and Sean Young. The nail in the coffin for the screenplay was Deckard falling in love with one of the androids. I found the film hard going. I'm not sci-fi weary as I like the early Star Wars films and indeed the latest releases but the dark vision of 2019 is depressing. I don't understand how this film has gathered such a cult following over the years. Apparently there is some debate over whether Deckard himself is a replicant. It sounds very negative but I'm not particularly interested.The religious symbolism of the film reminded me of another I saw recently Mother! (2017).

It is a film that was an unfortunate sleeper hit which didn't perform well on its initial theatric release. Here is my editorial review of Blade Runner, 30+ years later.Blade Runner is set in the futuristic visage of 2019 Los Angeles, which has been dominated by mega-corporations and consumerism. A concentrated group of synthetic, human-like androids (referred to in-film as Replicants) have disobeyed their orders and illegally arrived back to Earth for their own purposes. An LAPD officer and \"Blade Runner\" called Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) has been instructed by his superiors to track down and \"retire\" these rogue Replicants.To start things off, Blade Runner has an amazing visual style that has become well-known throughout the course of cinema. The city of Los Angeles itself looks otherworldly, yet oddly familiar when we delve deeper into the bustling city streets laden with corporate marketing and heavy traffic. The darkened cloudy aesthetics are hugely reminiscent of old-school noir films, this is also accented by the beautiful, atmospheric & synth-heavy soundtrack performed by Vangelis. On top of everything else, the cinematography is bold and stylish - and gives us a good look into this lovingly-detailed futuristic world. In summary, Blade Runner has a grimy, sleek style that looks wondrous in comparison to other sci-fi epics.The storyline takes on a hunter / hunted approach, which gives us the impression that both the humans and Replicants are ultimately two sides of the same coin. This whole idea is further cemented throughout the film, and leads us to further questions that are ultimately left ambiguous by the time the film is over. There's a great sense of mystery, even some elements of fear and sadness that become apparent as the film's plot progresses.There is but one thing that stops Blade Runner from being the perfect film, and that is the ridiculous amount of cuts that were made since its original release in 1982. There have been a total of 7 official cuts made for this film, some of which omit the gratuitous violence that is needed to keep the story and sense of direction in-balance. I would personally advise newcomers to watch the final cut for the full Blade Runner experience, especially since it's the cut that Ridley Scott himself is the most fond of.This films scores a high 9/10 for me personally, I strongly admire Blade Runner's sense of scope and incredibly unique atmosphere which was unlike anything else ever seen at that point. Up until this film's release, sci-fi films that the notorious distinction of being cheaply-made and quick to produce, but Blade Runner was the antithesis of that statement.I would recommend this film for fans of sci-fi epics such as Star Wars and other Ridley Scott films such as Alien. Blade Runner can also be enjoyable for fans of the cyberpunk / neo-noir genres.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "More Human Than Human", "date": "2023-02-16T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8873554"}, {"content": "This is a movie that I've gotten grief over in the past for not having seen, especially when people know that I like science fiction. I think part of it is that my father didn't watch this one or introduce it so it became a blind spot. I do have to thank Duncan for selecting this on Where to Begin with Film Noir/Neo-Noir films.What I find the most impressive with this movie is the world that is created. Part of it I think comes from being based on the Philip K. Dick novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'. I think another is that Ridley Scott did this. He is able to create a sci-fi world that is different from ours, but make it seem so normal that you just settle in. From there, we get a film noir mystery.Deckard (Harrison Ford) is our private detective. He originally worked for Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh) as a blade runner. This is an agent who would track down replicants. These are androids that were made as slave labor. They were created by Tyrell (Joe Turkel). Something about them is that they're designed to be better than humans. Some have turned and that is why blade runners are needed, to hunt them down. What is interesting here is that some are so advanced that they don't even know they are replicants.This follows four that stolen a ship, killed the passengers and came to Earth. They're led by Batty (Rutger Hauer). Deckard is pulled back in by Bryant to hunt him down. What makes this an interesting Neo-Noir are the elements of classics in the genre but altering them with the Sci-Fi elements. Deckard as I said is our PI. We have Batty and his crew as the villains. There is also the femme fatale with Rachael (Sean Young). She's a replicant but doesn't know it. Deckard offends and hurts her with a comment he makes. She is also the next step in replicant technology that makes her seem even more human by adding memories.Something I couldn't leave out would be talking about how good of a cast we have here. Ford is fine as our lead. This feels like a toned-down version of Han Solo. I'm not the biggest fan of him if I'm honest. Hauer is great. He has such a menacing look. I like Daryl Hannah and Brion James as his hench people. Walsh is good as the sleazy former boss. He takes on these roles so well. I also thought William Sanderson, Turkel, Joanna Cassidy and James Hong are solid as well. Just a solid group of character actors here that work well together.Now this might shock people, but I didn't love this one. I think it's good. What Scott did with Alien is here as well. Just making this world feel real and lived in, despite the advancement in technology. Even though this is upscaled, it holds up well enough. That adds to it. I still recognize that this a good movie and one that I believe I'll need to revisit now that I've seen it.

It was a film that was not successful in theaters and that only took off when it went to VHS, acquiring admirers since then and becoming one of the most respected films of all time. Set in a profoundly dystopian Los Angeles, it raises many philosophical and sociological questions around human nature, the course of humanity, our relationship with technology and our morality in general.Watching this film in 2022 was funny because the action of the film, released in 1982, takes place in the year 2019. That is, it was set in a future that, now, is past for me and never materialized (and I'm glad). The film's plot is not easy: humanity colonized other planets while destroying Earth, and created very realistic human androids while destroying itself. However, the androids, called replicants, got out of control, and are now hunted and killed, or used for the most vile purposes. The metaphors are clear, there is a lot of philosophical material, and it leaves us thinking for a long time.Ridley Scott gives us, with this film, one of his masterpieces. The film is magnificent in every way, and it is worth giving it the time it needs to surprise us. It creates a neo-noir plot where nobody is innocent or angelic, and where danger is everywhere. The lighting, the shutters on the windows, the indispensable \"femme fatale\", all the classic components of noir are here, in a frankly colorful film with sets and landscapes that combine the most grandiose futurism with the decadence and dirt of the world we destroy. The dialogues are memorable and full of deeply symbolic moments. The characters are rich, dense and complex, and it's extraordinary to think that we still don't really understand, after several decades, whether the main character is human or not.In fact, it seems that time has not passed for this film: if we think that it is from the early 80s, it is incredible that it is so visually powerful and that it has such good cinematography. It looks like a movie made ten years ago. The sets and costumes couldn't be better, and the special effects are stunning. The soundtrack, composed by Vangelis, is smooth and hypnotic.Adding to all this, we have Harrison Ford, in one of the most underrated works of his career. He does a really good job, and he deserved more recognition for that. Sean Young also deserves a round of applause for the way he brought his character to life, a replicant who really thinks she's human.

The set design, atmosphere, background extras, etc. Is amazing. Even watching it in 2023, I was amazed by the amount of work put into the set design to give the streets a more dark and futuristic cyberpunk look. I watched this film a long time ago as a kid and I nearly forgot that I watched it, but I rewatched the remastered version recently and remembered it again. There is literally zero sunlight and it's always dark due to the decades of human activity causing the sky to be covered up (nuclear war) and all animals are extinct except for artificially made animals. And there's neon lights everywhere, and large neon advertisement signs that make up for the dark skies. There's also a lot of Asians and Asian themes used in the movie which is looks very cool. Young Harrison Ford did a phenomenal job acting and played his role well, and so did all of the other lead actors. The Blade Runner story was originally from the legendary sci-fi writer, Philip K. Dick. The concept of the story was very captivating, especially for its time.However, aside from the beautiful set design and atmosphere, the movie was a little slow and the action sequences weren't very good. I do try to forgive the film a little due to the fact that it was made in 1982, but I thought to myself that it they could put in the hard work to make such beautiful sets, they could have choreographed better fight scenes and action scenes. For example, when Harrison Ford's character was chasing a replicant in the busy streets, it wasn't really too epic and I felt it could have been more thrilling. And also, the final fight in the movie was also far from epic, though it was the best action in the whole movie. At the beginning of the movie, it got me very excited about the story but I was basically waiting and waiting until the good part of the movie comes and it never came (which kind of made the movie feel short because I was just anticipating for some good action or story). Even the 1975 Jaws movie had way better action, and it was a movie about a killer shark... And Star Wars came out in 1977. So I'm sure the action and direction of the movie could've been better. If this movie was made in 2023 but with different actors and updated technology and kept the exact same plot and story, it would have gotten a pretty low rating... so the good ratings for the 1982 Blade Runner movie was due to other things about the film.Obviously, there are also a lot of let's say \"outdated concepts\" in this movie, such as the actor who played that old Asian man who obviously doesn't look like an Asian man (maybe Middle Eastern, West Asian looking but not Japanese), this is typically known as \"yellow face\". There was an old Asian lady in the movie (who was actually Asian) who had a speaking role, but the camera did not focus on her face while she was speaking which was a little weird. And of course the uncomfortable kissing scene with Harrison Ford's character (which I'm not sure if that was something normal back in 1982 when men force women to kiss). So these were just some weird minor things about the movie but I try to forgive the film due to it being made in a different time. I am surprised at least the film used a lot of Asian extras in the background and Asian imagery (Japanese neon signs and ads, Japanese restaurants, etc.).Overall, I still like the film due to the beautiful set design, atmosphere, and themes. The concept of the story was very good, but it just didn't play out very well in this film. The Blade Runner films do spark my imagination about a futuristic cyberpunk world with flying cars and dark skyscraper cities with lots of neon lights, but I wished the film did a better job with the story and action.. considering it is a movie about cops chasing after human robots.", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Great set design & atmosphere, poorly paced & weak action", "date": "2023-01-09T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8789832"}, {"content": "It's late so I'm not gonna make my long review right now, but wow this was underwhelming.Okay, long review time. So I'll admit, I think my opinion of Blade Runner is swayed by the fact that my expectations were so high, but can you blame me? Everyone says this is one of the best sci-fi movies of all time. I see that opinion everywhere, and it became the point where I viewed this as required viewing for a movie fan, which is why I watched it. Now with that aside, I want to say some stuff before I actually get into the review. First, wow this is easily going to be my most controversial Letterboxd review yet, and I don't think that it is even close. I will say that I have the concerns that I'm not fulling grasping the meaning of Blade Runner, so just in case, I'm going to review this at a base level. Just from my opinion and what I thought of the story, characters, etc. Alright, now let's talk about the story.The story is a mixed bag for me. A part of me really likes the basic premise and I think the idea of replicants and Blade Runners is really cool, but the other part of me doesn't really like the execution. There was a lot of promise at the start, and the story didn't go how I expected, which is fine, but where it went was.... Not what I would say I enjoyed. Some of the stuff I didn't like was how insignificant the replicants felt. They all went down so easily, and I expected more. Now I like slow movies, but I think Blade Runner moves too slow for its own good. The time it spends not progressing the plot, it spends creating a fantastic atmosphere and sets up the world, but I think it spends too much time doing this. The build up for each big plot is long, but the payoff never delivers. Some scenes are no doubt great, with my favorite scene in the movie being Roy meeting Dr. Tyrell. Great tension with great payoff, but that is the only scene I can say was tense. I found myself not caring what happened to the characters, and I think the reason for that is I don't think any of the characters are particularly good.I wish the characters were better. Maybe they are more complex and in-depth than I think, but even if I'm just not understanding the characters, I doubt understanding them would change the fact that I didn't care for a single one, and that might be why I was uninterested in the story. Deckard was entertaining enough at first, but him basically sexually assaulting Rachael made his character just downright unlikeable. It didn't help that he had nothing else going for him. I liked Roy as a villain at first, and actually found him interesting, but he felt like an entirely different character at the climax (wtf was up with him howling and stuff), and that just killed his character for me. Rachael was interesting with the fact she was a replicant, but other than that, I formed no emotional connection with her. The other characters were just bland and uninteresting.I feel like I've only been negative this entire time, so I'll talk about the part I REALLY like. The cinematography is amazing. The atmosphere is unmatched and the visuals are stunning, especially for when it came out. L. A. Looks very unique, and *very* clearly its design impacted the sci-fi genre ever since Blade Runner first released. Not only was the cinematography amazing, so was the sound design. Every little aspect of L. A. and the actions within sounded so real, not in the sense of realism. I don't really know how to describe it, but it sounded great.The acting was good. I found Harrison Ford's acting to be a little bland, but everyone else was pretty good. Even if I found his character questionable at the end, Roy's acting was great, and was one of the reasons I was so interested in his character at the start.Honestly, I don't hate Blade Runner, I just didn't like it, which is dissapointing considering how highly praised it is, but I do think this is essential viewing for movie fans considering how important it was for the sci-fi genre.", "rating": 4, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 3}, "heading": "A Classic, but I didn't Like It", "date": "2023-01-05T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8779138"}, {"content": "Ridley Scott created a legendary film that is just engrossing with a beautifully crafted atmosphere that captures the backdrop of a bustling retro futuristic dystopian society from the works of Philip K.

There is an original release (1982), a directors cut (1991) and a final cut (2007).The theme in \"Blade runner\" is the question if robots can develop (human) emotions. This question ia closely linked with the discipline of Artificial Intelligence, and so \"Blade runner\" shares this theme with the film \"AI\" (2001, Steven Spielberg).There are however nuances in the way the two films elaborate on the theme. In \"Blade runner\" the emotion in question is survival instinct. In \"AI\" the emotion in question is love. This distinction has several consequences. \"AI\" is not only about the question if robots can love humans, but also if the other way round is possible. Because the robots in \"AI\" have a social function they have a different look from the robots in \"Blade runner\", which are more like production robots.In a broader sense there are more films that search for the characteristic element that makes human beings human. Often the answer is \"emotions\", such as in \"Invasion of the body snatchers\" (1956, Don Siegel) and \"Wings of desire (1987, Wim Wenders). In the first mentioned film angels are looking for human emotions, in the other film human beings are afraid to lose their emotions.It must be said however that \"emotions\" are a broad concept. We already came across meanings as \"survival instinct\" (\"Blade runner\") and \"love\" (\"AI\"). In \"Wings of desire\" emotions are also used in the sense of \"love\", but in \"Invasion of the body snatchers\" we are talking about \"irrationality\".Earlier in this review I wrote about the robots in \"Blade runner\" being a kind of production robots. This points to another (sub)theme, being a society divided in the happy few (who consume) and the suppressed masses (who produce).

Now truly masters of their domain, humanity has reshaped the world in its own self-centered image. Overburdened and sullied with waste, the landscape flickers in neon hues and fluorescent glare. As gas-powered fireballs spit on the horizon and acid rain drips steadily in the streets, our mutual rush to conquer has rendered former essentials like daylight and animal life virtually extinct. Mere victims in the name of progress. That same callous attitude is applied to the artificial workers we employ for physically demanding off-planet work. Dubbed replicants, these synthetic beings are sent to fight our wars and pave the way for new interstellar colonies, but are also hamstrung with an extremely short lifespan and a strict prohibition from visiting Earth. Crucial failsafes, lest they harbor any undesirable thoughts about throwing the yoke.Fresh off the success of 1979's Alien, director Ridley Scott dips a toe in similar waters for this gloomy, epic, long-simmering Philip K. Dick adaptation. Set in an equally dark, lived-in future society, Blade Runner provides a strong tonal match while exploring a very different set of themes and ideas. In this case, we're concerned with the very fabric of conscious thought. Now that the human race has effectively opened Pandora's box and created a manner of life (the replicants), where do we draw the line between their brand of being and our own? Why are their lives considered so much more disposable? It's a rich question, later mirrored in films such as Ghost in the Shell and Ex Machina, and one for which there's no easy answer. Especially when the subjects react so emotionally, resorting to murder, deception and violence when their pleas for emancipation fall on deaf ears. These rebellious replicants don't make for objectively good people, but then, neither does a majority of the human race.Blade Runner is the best kind of science fiction. Morally thoughtful and conceptually ambitious, it puts the audience in a mixed state of awe and discomfort, then leaves us to grapple with the consequences.

It is forced upon one man, our hero, to track them down, and kill them.It would perhaps have been a simple enough task if not for the fact that they look, sound, and act just like humans. The lines between human and robot are blurred for our hero as well, despite his expertise at administering the test to uncover a \"replicant.\"Our hero gets the shakes after he kills each replicant. Early on, he is asked if he's ever killed a human by accident. He says no, but clearly the answer for him is not so simple. His response to killing a replicant sure seems to be the response of someone killing a human. He has sex with a replicant, falls in love with a replicant, a replicant that he personally identified as such in his test (which was news to her as well). \"Have you ever killed a human by accident?\" becomes the psychological struggle he must face in his Herculean trial.There are no clear heroes and villains in this story, just as there is not a clear distinction between replicant and human. Replicants, who seem to feel just as deeply as any human, simply want to survive, and extend their 4 year lifespan. They kill, and fight, because they have to, much like our hero in his pursuit of them. In the moments when they can kill our hero, the replicants even seem to seek a level of understanding: \"Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it.\" It's as if to say, \"don't you see, we're not so different, you and I.\"Even their struggle against their 4 year lifespan is not so different from any human struggle against mortality, a sentiment echoed in Gaff's words, the last lines of the movie as our hero runs away with his replicant love: \"It's too bad she won't live! But then again, who does?\"A unicorn origami on the floor, mirroring our protagonist's own vague memory, even implies that he too may be a replicant. Earlier in the movie he is asked if he's ever taken the test; he doesn't answer. Maybe he knows he's a replicant; maybe he knows he's a human; or maybe he knows that the answer doesn't mean a thing.It's perhaps a line of thought that he meant to avoid at all costs. It certainly makes it harder to systematically \"retire\" replicants if you believe them to be, for all intents and purposes, sentient and alive as any human. When Rachel follows him home to his apartment, he tries to push her away. To let her in is to have to admit to her that she's a replicant; and to admit that (knowing his feelings toward her) would be to admit that replicants are not exactly different from humans; and to admit that would be to admit the deeper admission that he could be a replicant. They are all interwoven conclusions.A strange aspect to the story is also the fact that his mission is a foregone conclusion. His whole task of hunting down and killing four replicants, is just speeding up the inevitable (their death after 4 years). He's tasked to do a thing that would've happened anyway. Along the way, his real journey is in coming to terms with his actions, his love, and his sense of self. To retire is to kill, to have a memory is perhaps no different than to have lived it, to love is to love, to live in fear is no way for anyone to live, and we all must come to terms with our inevitable demise (no matter how much we can rage against our creator).In it's weaving of these questions, the movie has some of the most beautiful visuals of any film I've ever seen, incorporating famous LA architecture, futuristic streetscapes, all amid haunting lighting and costumes.

Yea, sure, visually it has a certain style to it, not my cup of tea, but even if I loved the movie visually, it wouldn't save it from being boring and confusing beyond belief.It's almost impossible to figure out what's happening, because apparently in the future, lights don't exist, the ultra rich live in abandoned, crumbling, flooded buildings, and it rains constantly, making it impossible to hear what's going on.I'll explain the most confusing part of the movie. Harrison Ford is sitting at a piano, then suddenly there's a clip of a unicorn running through the forest. Why? Who knows. He then walks over to a picture he got from an apartment, spends about 5 minutes speaking to a computer to get a blurry close up picture of some girl. Now he goes and shows some evidence to some woman, who sends him to a snake seller with an extremely thick Asian accent. He then ends up in a bar talking to another person with a very thick accent who you can barely hear over the noise inside this bar.He then gets some drink from a class which appears to be full of tiny snakes. Then with zero explanation he's using a payphone to call up a girl, asks her to come to the bar, she refuses and hangs up. Then with zero explanation he's standing in a hallway, and inexplicably puts on some ridiculous accent to talk to a girl holding a snake. Now this it turns out is the girl in the photo, but there's no way you could of known this, even if the photo was 1000 megapixels because she's covered in makeup from head to toe. In fact I couldn't be sure this was Harrison Ford and not another character in a totally different location. So after talking to her for a while she suddenly beats him up and runs away - there was no way she could of possibly figured out who he was while talking to him, so why she didn't just run away earlier or ignore him I don't have a clue - then he chases her and shoots her. Now when I saw her getting shot, I still had zero clue this was the girl from the photo. Earlier in the movie, someone asked him if he'd ever shot a human instead of a replicant by mistake, and not realising this was a replicant, I assumed that was what was happening in this scene, but no, it turns out that was his target the whole time. I actually had to stop the movie at this point and read the Wikipedia article to figure out what had just happened.I have no idea what anyone likes about this movie. I can only think of two movies I've seen that were more boring than this one - Remember the Light and Barely Legal - at least both of those were less than 90 minutes long.

Released in 1982, Blade Runner was originally a box office flop despite receiving excellent reviews, however the movie has since become regarded as a masterpiece. Harrison Ford was fantastic in a darker role following his heroic roles in Star Wars (1977), The Empire Strikes Back (1980) and Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981). The late Rutger Hauer was a delight to watch on screen. Director Ridley Scott can also add this to one of his most memorable movies.Based on Philip K. Dick's story \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" Blade Runner takes place in 2019 in a futuristic Los Angeles. Synthetic humans known as replicants are being developed by Dr. Eldon Tyrell (Joe Erkel) of the Tyrell Corporation to work on space colonies as they have been declared illegal on Earth as they are considered to be dangerous. Former LAPD Detective and Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is coaxed out of retirement by his boss Captain Bryant (M. Emmett Walsh) to track down four dangerous replicants who have escaped following a spaceship crash. A Blade Runner is responsible for tracking down replicants and to terminate them which is called \"retirement\". The escapees include Roy Batty (the late Rutger Hauer), Leon (the late Brion James), Pris (Daryl Hannah) and Zhora (Joanna Cassidy). As Deckard hunts down the replicants, he finds himself torn between his duty to retire the replicants as he finds himself falling for Tyrell's assistant Rachel (Sean Young) who may or may not be a replicant.The rest of the cast includes Edward James Olmos as Gaff who is a fellow Blade Runner, William Sanderson as J. F. Sebastian who is a genetic creator, and James Hong as Hannibal Chew who is a genetic engineer that produces eyes for the replicants.There are several versions of Blade Runner that exist including the 1982 theatrical version, the 1992 Director's Cut which removed Harrison Ford's narration, added a unicorn dream sequence, and a darker ambiguous ending. The 2007 Final Cut adds a few smaller scenes and adds the full sequence of the unicorn dream.Blade Runner is still a visually dazzling classic 40 years on and I must say the visual effects and art design has aged very well. Ridley Scott did a superb job and Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer were fantastic. Blade Runner can also be credited with more of Phillip K. Dick's works being adapted for the screen with movies such as Total Recall (1990), Minority Report (2002), and A Scanner Darkly (2006). It's a shame Blade Runner flopped at the box office in 1982, but thankfully has grown to become more appreciated as time has passed and later became more successful on VHS and with the subsequent releases of the director's cut in 1992 and the final cut in 2007.

And of the hero, Deckard (Harrison Ford), all we can say for sure is that director Ridley Scott has left clues in various versions of his film that can be used to prove that Deckard is a human -- or a replicant. The biggest change Scott made in earlier versions was to drop the voice-over narration from the 1982 original. Spoken by Ford, channeling Philip Marlowe, it explained things on behalf of a studio nervous that we wouldn't understand the film. Since much of the interest in the film has been generated by what we weren't sure we understood, that turned out to be no problem. The ending has been tweaked from bleak to romantic to existential to an assortment of the above, and shots have come and gone, but for me the most important change in the 2007 version is in the print itself. The action follows Deckard, a \"blade runner\" who is assigned to track down and kill six rebel replicants who have returned illegally from off-worlds to earth, and are thought to be in Los Angeles. (The movie never actually deals with more than five replicants, however, unless, as the critic Tim Dirks speculates, Deckard might be the sixth). Replicants, as you know, are androids who are \"more human than human,\" manufactured to perform skilled slave labor on earth colonies. Ridley Scott is a considerable director who makes no small plans. His credits include \"Alien,\" \"Legend,\" the inexplicable \"1492: Conquest Of Paradise,\" \"Gladiator,\" \"Black Hawk Down\" and the brilliant \"Matchstick Men,\" and his \"American Gangster\" opened Friday in theaters. He has the gift of making action on a vast scale seem comprehensible. I have been assured that my problems in the past with \"Blade Runner\" represent a failure of my own taste and imagination, but if the film was perfect, why has Sir Ridley continued to tinker with it, and now released his fifth version?", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Philosophical", "date": "2022-08-22T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8476038"}, {"content": "Get ready for a ride!

While the last action sequence was quite well done, it lacked power due to the film's inability to create stakes that you felt invested in.

I believe it is the greatest classic of science fiction , in a script where with few initial words they already let you know all the news in which the film is set, in 2019 in a decadent Los Angeles, dirty with a lot of oriental culture ( We see ridley Scott's idea of globalization, extinct animals etc... ) to help colonize other planets were created by the Tyrrel industry for commercial purposes \"the replicants \" artificial human beings with only a little more strength but with their pre-established useful life . The film places them as dangerous beings who can kill at any time fighting for their cause ( which we will later see will be the extension of their life ) but in fact they ended up serving of slaves for the human race and some rebels would come to Earth to try to live among humans so the local police use the bladerunner ( android hunters ) that there are even others but none with the capacity of the main character.The photography is sensational, masterpiece, I loved Tim Burton's Gotham City ambience in Batman 89, only long after I watched Bladerunner , I came to find Gotham without originality after that....\nLights with a lot of contrast all the time, with a lot of brightness and darkness , smoke and rain give the idea of social inequality and where the cyberpunk style originated and puts us in one of the biggest atmospheres ever created.Very well made characters that really work, it is worth highlighting a replicant that cries phenomenally when it learns that its memories are only placed on its consciousness and it is not really human. And yet the director asks us questions to think about the dreams of deckard main character who has dreams if they are natural or just memories introduced.Finally, a film about survival, which we initially think is only of humans but later also of replicants, with much research, a film that is normally slow , with a lot of suspense that puts action very well embedded at the right times. A subtle but important love of a bladerunner for a replicant that makes us wonder if it is really right to exterminate these beings .Very intelligent dialogues throughout the film but the dialogue of the final scene of the leader of the replicants for me is a poetry that was eternalized in the seventh art.

It's just type of a movie you need to really think about. Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is undoubtedly remarkable and extraordinary work in so many ways.First of all, it's dark, oppressive noir atmosphere that doesn't leave the viewer even for a second created by setting, always fitting soundtrack, Harrison Ford's charismatic voiceover, impressive amount of attention to details in showing decaying world where 'if you're not cop, you're little people', where you're promised to have a great life somewhere else, far away from here and where it's always rainy and moody. This movie has a style that's for sure. I also love its unhurried, thoughtful narrative. Everyone involved in creating Blade Runner made a magnificent work.Another important thing to point out is definitely movie's phyloshopy that never gives you an easy answers, but make you think about so much. What makes us who we are? Can we be defined by our life experience and memories? Can we be sure those are real? How long do we have before our time is up? What a person think about when dying and how does being close to death affect our values? And so much more eternal questions that we all can have different answers for. Film just gives you a perspective, that's all.Story, characters and the way they are portrayed are also what makes Blade Runner so amazing. The story itself is quite simple but yet good enough. The combination of different genres makes it work. Blade Runner doesn't have characters that are good or bad, it's up to vievew to decide. Because if I personally really dive into the narrative I keep asking myself: are replicants that bad? They were surely desperate, their time was running out and all they wanted was to make it last. It's pretty relatable. And when they were killing, they kept trying to make others feel the way they've been made to feel by being slaves. They may not be humans but they weren't emotionless robots. And the main character? Is he one of the good guys? Blade runners were not supposed to have emotions, basically they were just machines for killing. Rick Deckard is not one of those but is he even human? Film have some hints that leave you uncertain.All that being said, the film has some questionable moments like how didn't they even try to search Leon to make sure he had no guns? Also knowing how good Deckard is at his job, I was expecting him to have some strategy against replicants but, in fact, he was just lucky to stay alive all the time thanks to some cliches.

This is now a well-established fiction that has passed the test of time and over a long history has won the favor of viewers around the world, besides revealing the birth of a whole direction, which is now commonly called cyberpunk.Taking as a basis the well-known novel by Philip K. Dick \"Do androids dream of electroovtsy?\" Sir Ridley supplemented the work, substantially reworked it, breathing something new into his picture. This film was imbued with the atmosphere of the decline of the future, the dominance of various technological innovations, which at the same time, it seems to me, absolutely did not bring joy to people. Society vegetates in a monstrous world of consumption, where a person and his personality are lost among a large crowd. Scott perfectly conveys the atmosphere of an authentic future, playing superbly with dark tones, and tells his story through the prism of a society falling into decline.The genre that was born thanks to this picture is now recognized thanks to the noticeable features of this film. The world here is presented in the form of a night city with the presence of numerous bright neon colors, a lot of advertising signs, frequent rains. Here you will be met by futuristic, but angular cars that fly right in the clouds, corporations rule the world, and artificial people can meet among the inhabitants of the planet. They're replicants.The main character, played by Harrison Ford, will have to face a group of them. He is a representative of a special squad called Blade Runners, who are fighting the appearance of replicants on Earth,. And his mission is to find several dangerous representatives of artificial people in order to prevent their existence on our planet. Ford's hero named Rick Deckard will do this with special interest for observation. The script and direction of the project allow you to plunge into the authentic world of the night metropolis, which is as familiar to everyone living in it as it is just as dangerous for them.The film poses a lot of questions to the audience, the main one of which boils down to drawing a line between real people and artificial ones. The topic is not new and even popular for that time. But, like any author, Philip K. Dick and Ridley Scott, who filmed this book masterpiece, answer this question in their own way.What is the role of man in this world? And who are the replicants? The latter are the offspring of the former, but how different are they? Where is the line between them, because everyone has their own consciousness, memory, and, as I think, feelings. It will be difficult to answer, each viewer will decide for himself which verdict will be right for him.An important heroine, played by Sean Young, will help the viewer and the main character to understand this issue. Her Rachel is shrouded in mystery, she is a special heroine who allows you to better understand this world of people and replicants.The film is complex and viscous. You drown in it, it seems long and slow. However, now, it would seem, these losing moments have become the hallmark of the work. The general plans of a dark city, towering pillars of fire somewhere in the distance, electronic sad music, like the sounds of loneliness of everyone and everyone in this huge metropolis - all this conveys the atmosphere of Scott's work.For this world, as if such wonderful actors as Rutger Hauer, Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Daryl Hannah, Bryon James and others appeared to the world as a selection. A great hit for everyone, the creation of unique and memorable characters.The picture will definitely make you think about the place of a person in the modern world and the future world of the future. Who will live next to us, how will we treat them, will the new artificial creatures pose a threat to people? There are a lot of questions that are quite difficult to answer.But I will never forget that monologue of Rutger Hauer's hero in the finale, his tears in the rain: \"I saw things that you people never dreamed of. Attacking ships blazing over Orion; Si rays cutting through the darkness at the gates of Tannhauser. All these moments will be lost in time, like... tears in the rain... It's time to die.\"It seems that this is the quintessence of the whole work, when not only Deckard will rethink the familiar reality, but the audience along with him.7 out of 10.", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Classics for all time by Ridley Scott", "date": "2022-08-03T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8396143"}, {"content": "I just don't get Blade Runner.

I found it boring, slow, and pretentious, and for the life of me could not understand the hype surrounding it. And for about a decade or so, I maintain that same position, even after watching and really enjoying the film's sequel, Blade Runner 2049.However, a few months ago, the Final Cut of the movie appeared on Netflix and I decided to give it another try. I found it more enjoyable the second time around, but still wasn't huge on the movie's final act, which I admittedly didn't understand. After another viewing yesterday, and after digging deeper into the meanings and interpretations behind the film, I can say that, while I don't consider this to be the perfect masterpiece that so many others do, I've grown to truly appreciate and respect Blade Runner for what it is.Loosely based on Philip K. Dick's \"Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?\", Blade Runner is set in a futuristic 2019 and follows Rick Deckard, a police detective known as a Blade Runner, whose job is to hunt down humanoid robots known as Replicants and \"retire\" (i.e. Kill) them if necessary. At the beginning of the movie he is commissioned to hunt down four Replicants who are on Earth illegally seeking more life from their creator Tyrell. Along the way, he meets Racheal, a Replicant who doesn't know she's a Replicant, and begins to develop feelings towards her.Visually this film is stunning. The cinematography coupled with the atmosphere and tone of the setting really suck you into the world of Blade Runner, not to mention the score by Vangelis which gives the film a very noir feeling while coupling it with futuristic soundscapes. There are great performances, specifically Harrison Ford and Sean Young, and Rutger Hauer (RIP) delivers a more interesting and two-dimensional villain than we are often accustomed to in sci-fi. While the slow pace was a turn off for me during first viewing, I actually didn't find the movie to be slow or boring on repeated viewings. I actually think the movie is perfectly paced for what it is, and what little action is included in the movie is well orchestrated.Of course what really sells Blade Runner are its themes regarding humanity and what it means to be human. It's very deep and rich in these themes, exploring how these Replicants behave and whether or not they truly feel or have motivation behind their actions. This is especially present in the film's climax, with the famous \"Tears In Rain\" speech, which is one of the movie's highlights.There is one scene of course that knocks the film down a couple of pegs, and that is the love scene between Deckard and Rachael. To be perfectly blunt, it comes across as creepy and, for lack of a better word, rapey. I don't think that was the intention of the filmmakers, and maybe things were different in the 80s than they are now, but this scene has not aged well and probably never will. I also wish there was a little bit more backstory as to why Earth is the way it is in the movie, but it isn't necessarily vital to the story.Overall, Blade Runner is a really great film that gives you a fully realized world, deep themes, and below the surface characterization. The flaws mentioned above keep it from getting a higher rating, but now I can kind of see why so many people consider this to be a masterpiece in a way that I didn't before. I recommend it if you're a fan of sci-fi; just know that it may take a little while before it clicks with you.

The philosophy of this film makes you wonder what is the distinction of being human, or what is the point of life. And this very idea was executed in a very good way. Of course, to me Ridley Scott is the best director for reallism, and this film is a very good example why. Of course the acting was really good and the camera work was pretty good also. One thing i appreciate a lot about this movie is the way you can feel the dirtiness of 2019 Los Angeles. Yes, the way we feel the environement is very important to world building because then we are a lot more invested in the movie and can understand events a lot easier.

With due apologies to my sentimental favorite, Star Wars, and to the way-ahead-of-its-time 2001, Bladerunner combines all the elements of great storytelling into a visually stunning picture, and like the best SciFi, asks \"the big questions\" without sounding preachy about it.So, what IS the big question? Nothing more or less than: What does it mean to be human? Wow.Is an artificially created human life really human? Does that creature have a soul? Is it worthy of all the rights and values we put on human life? What is our responsibility as the creator of such a life?And happily for us, the answers are not clear and can be (and have been) endlessly debated. As I said above, great SciFi asks questions, but the best SciFi doesn't have the arrogance to pretend to have the answers.Philosophy aside, the script, the acting and the cinematography are top-notch. Harrison Ford tops even his fantastic Indiana Jones as our protagonist, Sean Young is stunning and strong and vulnerable as the object of his obsession, and Rutger Hauer gives one of the all-time great movie monologues. Supporting actors are strong throughout and no character or situation is superfluous or just filling screen space and time.An absolute masterpiece.Note: There are several versions of the movie out there.

Though played as a cyberpunk, dystopian situated sci-fi movie, the film also succeeds as a film-noir to greater effect. The Tyrell Corporation have created humanoid individuals known as replicants who resemble humans, but more powerful and advanced, but have become illegal to enter Earth. A special police force known as Blade Runners have been assigned to \"retire\" them.Unlike the traditional noir films, \"Blade Runner\" has colour, though it's still dark, dreary and rains in every scene. Light of day is absent in in this movie. The environment in this movie is quite infertile, combined with archaic technology, an abnormal looking bluish light, and spaceships that have neon backgrounds. The aesthetic in this movie truly captures the essence of 1980's cinema where the old school technology is compared to the more modern standards. Though the sci-fi genre may have worn out it's welcome over the years, the storytelling featured here is appealing. Underneath the continual raining, \"Blade Runner\" is very culturally uplifting, with a diverse melting pot of unique people and their customs.Four replicants have invaded Earth and it's up to felloe Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) to retire them. But looking for them is like easier said than done. But Deckard has the most experience of all the Blade Runners out there.His first quest is to look for the creator of these replicants Dr. Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel) and to conduct a test on young woman named Rachael (Sean Young) who might be a replicant, though she might not know if she is one. Deckard conducts the Voight-Kampff test on her and goes further into his investigation. Meanwhile loose replicant Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) and Leon Kowalski (Brion James) an eye manufacturer for replicant, Hannibal Chew (James Hong) who leads them to a gifted genetic designer J. F. Sebastian (William Sanderson). Meanwhile fellow replicant, Pris (Daryl Hannah) gets invited into Sebastian's home.Deckard's first encounter with a replicant leads him on a trail of snake scales and that is where he meets Zhora (Joanna Cassidy) who poses as a stripper with a computerized snake. Deckard goes incognito while Zhora goes on with her act, but then kills her. Leon knows what had transpired. And tries to get even. With some assistance, Deckard was able to finish off Leon making it two down and two more to go.Roy follows Sebastian to the secret headquarters to Dr. Tyrell's domain where it's been revealed that replicants can only function under a four year lifespan. Roy has some choice words from his creator and they have a conflicting exchange of words. After that heated discussion, Roy gives his master a kiss and then eliminates him. Shortly afterwards, Sebastian met his fate as well. The Roy/Tyrell confrontation can almost be similiar exchanges between Dr. Frankenstein and his creature as both end up questioning their existence.Deckard finds Pris at Sebastian's apartment and gets ambushed, but he later kills her and now it just comes down to Rick and Roy for a climactic showdown. These scenes might look like a mindless cat and mouse chase as each character is looking to destroy one another and at times it appear like both adversaries come across as inhuman. Though we know Roy is a replicant, we even somtimes wonder if Deckard himself is one too. The ending seems to come to a strange, but rather powerful climax. In the end the villain himself ends up saving Deckard from falling to his death while knowing all to well that his days are numbered. He lets out a monologue revealing that his limited time on Earth will be like tears from the rain, lost in time.A mysterious individual named Gaff (Edward James Olmos) a fellow officer who's crafty in origami mentions to Deckard that she too won't have long to live, making us think she might be a replicant. He comes to his apartment and sees Rachael sleeping in his bed and sees the origami unicorn that was made by Gaff. Deckard takes Rachael and drive away without caring if she's a replicant or not.One of the things that make this film stand out is that all the variations of this movie (The Director's Cut, The Final Cut etc.) is that there are different interpretations for each and every one of them. The magic of this film is the allure and the appeal of the fan base it's gotten over the years. And though the happy ending might be a bit cliched and wrapped up way too nicely for its own tastes, it's still a good watch for everyone to enjoy.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 2}, "heading": "A Sci-Fi That Doesn't Insult Your Intelligence", "date": "2022-05-15T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8147290"}, {"content": "A really great movie very cult but remember you should watch the director's cut version or the final cut that visually is even better and NOT watch the theatrical cut.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "A must watch movie", "date": "2022-05-14T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8144097"}, {"content": "I start from the point that pleased me the most, the way the film is conducted, its rhythm is perfect, it left me entertained and satisfied throughout the entire film; The characters and plot dilemmas are another extremely positive point, making everything deeper and making you reflect on, something that few films can; The movie also has beautiful visuals and atmosphere, you can see how much effort they put into this project.One of the best science fiction I've ever seen, I recommend it to everyone who likes the genre.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Impresses in multiple spots", "date": "2022-05-12T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8136686"}, {"content": "I loved every minute of this movie.

The cast performs decently well, highlighted by Ford's sometimes intriguing role. Unfortunately, not much character development occurs just as the themes are not satisfactorily explored. The plot does set up understandable motivations for the characters, yet fails to create much of a convincing emotional depth out of them. Relationships between characters are largely overlooked, as well. Ford's lead role is absolutely the most intriguing and best character of the feature, but even he lacks an entirely distinct personality that could make the audience latch onto his fate. This makes the created tension, and therefore all the action, feel lesser than it should be. Although there are solid visuals and interesting set designs throughout, they surprisingly do not play much into the fight choreography, which takes place in more darkness than not. World building is solidly achieved, but there is ultimately much left desired in this small feel, slowly paced feature. There is a good score which compliments many scenes, though. Additionally, the central theme is intriguing and provides for a solid bookend to the plot due to last second dialogue.

Amongst many feelings, one thing seems obvious to me: it did not live up to my hype. Perhaps that is the hype's fault though more than the film?Visually, it's everything I had hoped for and more, it looks incredible and I never expected a 1982 sci-fi film could feel so modern and like it aged so well 40 years later. All sci-fi-films from this era usually have their fair share of very cringy, incredibly outdated \"special effects moments\" (even Star Wars is no exception) but save for some minor details Blade Runner really does feel like a film made just a few years ago, or maybe this year. Almost. It's like every synthwave/retrowave art ever made has exclusively used Blade Runner for reference and no other sci-fi. That's why it's such a shame that neither the story nor the characters are anywhere near as interesting.Perhaps I am indeed one of the many people \"Blade Runner's\" more vocal fans claim just \"doesn't get it\", and I'm perfectly open to accepting that, but one thing I am not is a contrarian just for the sake of being a contrarian. I simply cannot look past the vapid excuse of a script in this film, nor the wooden acting. And yes, I know that a significant amount of the film's cast are replicants and therefore you might say this rigidity could well be expected, but when Roy towards the end of the film suddenly is anything but wooden but instead very animated (howling like a wolf no less, for some reason) it isn't any better. It is in fact even worse. Not to mention outright laughable scenes like Roy \"entering\" headfirst through a wall, or another replicant conveniently not making use of her 100 %, clear-as-day opportunity to kill Deckard in favour of making herself a perfect target and be killed. The last 15-20 minutes of the film were quite different from the tone of the rest of the film, but it's not for the better, it feels odd and disjointed.I get the themes of the film and the points it's trying to convey, at least I'd like to think I do. And they are interesting, important points to ponder (albeit ones seen in plenty of other fiction; it is of course important to remember it was less so when the film originally came out) but the execution could have been and should have been leagues better if more time and effort had been spent in this area rather than the visual, cinematographic department.There isn't really anything inherently wrong with the story, just with the execution of it and ABOVE ALL the (non-existant) pacing. I did like that the film, for a good chunk of it's runtime, was not an action film, I thought that felt fresh especially for an 80s sci-fi picture and I feel like criticism about the film having too little action misses the entire point of \"Blade Runner\". It is, then, not so much that the lack of action is boring as it is that the lack of depth or motivations of the characters is boring.I gave this film a 7/10, but that is a generous score not based very much on the substance of the film itself. Rather, I just can't help but swoon over the gorgeous retrofuturistic visuals (which of course in 1982 were simply \"futuristic\") and Vangelis' soundtrack, even if I thought that the music could have benefitted from being less quiet, and less in the background. In the end, the end result is a mixed bag and whether or not people will enjoy this film is entirely based on what you're looking to get out of it. Blade Runner is fantastic as a retroactive display of the neo-noir sci-fi of the 80s that has become an appreciated aesthetic and subculture in modern times, but as a film?

Also, ten year olds didn't get to see R rated films in 1982. So my first experience was reading the Archie Goodwin/Al Williamson Marvel Comics adaption, a book of which I literally read until the cover came off.I must have read this issue a thousand times.Steranko cover!I also asked my uncle, a librarian, for a copy of Philip K. DIck's Do Androids Dream of Electronic Sheep? Perhaps a ten-year-old was not yet ready for the complexity of Phillip K. Dick, but he never dumbed it down for me.The first time I finally saw Blade Runner on HBO it was after a year of reading about the film in Starlog, obsessing over the comic book and the source novel, so my experience was so alien to anyone else that saw it in theaters in 1982.For a movie seen as a failure - it made $41.6 million on a $30 million budget, so I have no idea how that is failure - this is a movie that literally changed the world and has grown to become our world.And yet, this is a movie that has seven different versions thanks to all of the changes from studio executives. Even the voiceover, which was added by them, has star Harrison Ford reading the words as if he has no interest, perhaps hoping if they were bad they'd never be used.The blade runner is former police officer Rick Deckard (Ford), who is charged by Gaff (Edward James Olmos) and Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh) with doing what he does best: hunting down robotic humanoids and retiring them. Now, he must stop four Nexus-6 replicants: Leon Kowalski (Brion James), Zhora Salome (Joanna Cassidy), Pris (Daryl Hannah) and Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer).Yet within this film noir story set in a neon-filled future straight out of a Moebius drawing, the real tale is about whether Rick and his lover Rachael (Sean Young) are humans or machines themselves. In fact, of all the characters, Batty is the most human of them all, a character of both deep menace and surprising tender thoughts.Blade Runner arises from pain. Ridley Scott had left Dune and lost his brother in short order and wanted something to take his mind off life. Dick had no idea it was even being made, but his initial distrust was saved somewhat when he saw the script revisions and special effects footage. Ford and Scott also fought throughout.Neither can agree if Deckard is human or replicant, even if they've made up.I think about Blade Runner a lot. I think about Pris flipping across the room, how her face paint looks, how deadly these killing machines are with such grace. I think of Rutger Hauer ad-libbing \"All those moments will be lost in time...like tears in rain\" and caressing the dove. I remember the spinner police car and Deckard's car that I had as a kid and played with constantly. And I wonder, does Gaff leave the silver unicorn after not killing Rachael as him telling Deckard to pursue his dream or is Deckard's dream of the unicorn just one progammed into him?Most of all, I'm so thankful for this movie because without it, I may not be so fascinated by Philip K.

I am not a Harrison Ford fan by any means I like Star Wars & Indiana Jones but this was a solid performance from Forward. He definitely captures the character very well.However I felt even for a under 2 hour movie this felt like a dull drag. I was intrigued at first and then slowly it began to kind of drag on and I felt somewhat losing interest. I am a huge fan of indie films and strange films but this film just didnt vibe with me.When the we get to the final act and the final face off if you will the way The Final Cut decides to wrap up felt so underwhelming. I do not always need an epic action filled ending but the way this wraps up just left me with \"That's it?\".The pros of this film is Fords performance and the special effects for its time was seriously impressive. The world they take into gives you typical film noir with a sci-fi flare. The world itself feels like a character on its own.

But among them is Blade Runner, a film that completely flopped upon its first release, but is now worshipped both in and out of film circles as a classic of the neo-noir genre.There's a very specific reason I simply adore Blade Runner so much - its vision of the future. Well, the future at the time - I am writing this review in 2022, meaning that according to Blade Runner, \"the future\" was three years ago. Either way, in a genre that's usually filled with colourful fantasy, Blade Runner is as noir as they get - mysteries that need solving, dark skyscrapers at night, rain, violence, all wrapped with a wonderfully-executed dose of brain-bending existentialism that makes us wonder what being human means.The film's pacing is languid, and I've noticed that brought up a lot. I mean, in general, I wouldn't say that this is the easiest film to love. The first time I saw it a few years ago, I had no idea what was going on, the storyline confused me, and the slowness of everything really didn't help. But upon a recent rewatch, that slowness is what really leaves time to appreciate the film in and of itself. Honestly, I feel like the miniature skyscraper shots could have an entire separate film dedicated to them, and Vangelis's soundtrack is probably my favourite piece of film music of all time. I guess that Blade Runner really is a bit of an acquired taste.Speaking of the visual effects, I don't think I'll ever stop praising them. I miss old science fiction, back when visual effects were hand-crafted and took care and time, as opposed to now, when everything has been replaced by computer renders and green screen. And honestly, the miniatures in this look better than half of the commercial green-screen garbage that we get nowadays anyway. I wish science fiction could go back to a simpler time.I watched the Final Cut, so I don't know what it's like with the voiceover or the \"happy ending\", but I'm honestly kind of glad that I don't. I enjoy the way that Ridley Scott's final vision throws us into this world of darkness with no explanation, and I like that ambiguous ending that keeps you wondering.In conclusion, even though I do agree that appreciation of a film such as Blade Runner is acquired, it's definitely a must-see science fiction classic.-Sasha.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Neo-noir meets science fiction in a classic of both genres.", "date": "2022-04-06T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw8038009"}, {"content": "I'm 52 and this is first, and only time I will watch it.

His childish approach to directing (seconded only by Michael Bay) ruined what could have been a great film, or even a saga. An entire \"film universe\" could have been build around replicants, similarly to what X-men have become. Instead, Scott pooped out this short, rushed, flawed film without any depth or character development.Alien was an okay film, because the theme is super simple and shallow - one ship, one crew, an alien. That's it. Not even Scott could mess that up too badly, especially when Sigourney Weaver carried his ass. In Blade Runner, there was nothing to stop Scott from botching the theme.Notes:\nI was pleasantly surprised by how the visual effects hold up in 2021. However, the thriller/action scenes suffer from bad cuts and overall bad directing, which is the actual reason they are lackluster.Was there no controversy about the scene where Ford rapes that replicant? I was shocked when I watched it and thought almost everyone else had been, but to my surprise I didn't find any outrage.

It is also the most widely available version nowadays and hence it is the version that I recommend to seek out and watch.\"Blade Runner\" mixes classical noir cinema with a sleek cyberpunk Japanese anime-inspired aesthetic. The cinematography is what makes this movie shine to me. Every shot, angle, lighting, is mesmerizing to witness. Harrison Ford does a great job as the blade runner agent, Deckard, as well.It was kind of a bomb when it came out, but I attribute that to audiences not really understanding what it was and poor marketing for the film. It's also R-rated, which normally affects a movie's performance as well. The large budget and some sci-fi action scenes shown in marketing steered a lot of people into wrong perceptions of the movie and critics thus wrote it off as slow and boring. It is first and foremost a noir crime mystery, much more in the vein of something like \"Chinatown\" than \"Star Wars.\"The plot and themes of this movie can't be ignored either. Our story centers around a group of agents known as \"blade runners\", whose job is to track down and \"retire\" android human replicants because they become rebellious and unreliable at a certain stage in their life cycle. A few rogue replicants have returned to earth and murdered a blade runner, so it is Deckard's job to find them and eliminate them. Throughout the movie, we are questioned about the very things that make us human.Timeless and classic, this movie stands as a marvel of cinema and a true testament to the fact that sci-fi as a genre can help us isolate our problems as a species; to put them in a hypothetical realm of fiction and analyze them without malice or prejudice. The gritty noir crime mystery style marries excellently with that. I recommend this movie to just about anybody who likes these types of deep philosophical stories.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Man or Machine?", "date": "2021-11-29T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7597028"}, {"content": "This is a slow moving, boring movie.

And the people presented as antagonists, turn out to be escaped slaves coming back to earth to kill members of the slave trade. The movie doesn't rub the slaves' plight in your face though, the way a Tarantino movie would. There is no poppy 60s rock hit playing while the killing happens. Killing is treated seriously no matter who dies. And because of this it took me several viewings to realize the obvious. I have seen many YouTube reviews done by very good film critics who even miss this point. They complain that the good guy shouldn't be drinking and molesting up the neighborhood. But he's NOT the good guy. Sheesh. The good guy is the escaped slave - not the bad cop.Anyways.There have been many versions, I think my favorite is the late 90s director's cut because it has warmer colors than other versions.

Unless this happens, the replicant remains a \"simpersonator\", able to simulate personalities, but always confusing personality-function with consciousness-as-essence. In other words, unlike Deckard, the pure subject would not go from \"it does not know what it is\" to \"it now knows what it is\", but from \"it does not know what it is\" to \"it knows it cannot know what it is becoming\", which is the kind of morbidly fked up place Cronenberg now resides. But, philosophically, \"Blade Runner\" doesn't go this extra mile. If the film is about nostalgia and loss, it remains trapped on the level of thinking in terms of \"memories\" and \"death\". IE - whether replicant or human, memories aren't ours and all existence ends in death, as bemoaned by one dying, rain-drenched replicant. In this regard, the film is a lamentation more in the style of such Westerns as \"Once Upon A Time In The West\", \"Unforgiven\" and \"The Wild Bunch\". Indeed, \"Blade Runner's\" screenwriter, David Peoples, injects many western motifs into the film, borrows heavily from \"High Noon\" (a 1952 western that features a lone bounty hunter tasked with killing four outlaws) and would himself go on to write \"Unforgiven\". Fused with these are director Ridley Scott's motifs - an emphasis on eyes, photographs, pictures etc - (photographs are objects of place, sentiment, history, and memory. Similarly, phrases like \"we get the picture\" or \"world picture\" show that consciousness can be discussed in terms of a picture) all of which stress the recording and capturing of memories.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "The glimpse of our future", "date": "2021-11-22T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7573856"}, {"content": "Not good.

Only after seeing it several times along the years, the film's haunting and bleak atmosphere has started to appeal to me. At first I thought it's too depressing but a while ago I had this strange thought: \"hmm... I miss that Blade Runner atmosphere, I should watch it again!\" Then, a couple of days ago I found the blu ray (Final Cut) very cheap so I decided to pick it up.I've always liked the visuals of this movie. The amazing futuristic landscapes and neon light effects, it's all some of the best special effects in any movies ever.The story is a bit more complex thing. I'm not sure if I still entirely get the themes it deals with but I've started to like it anyway. But one thing I must say: it's not a very good movie to casually put playing when you want something fun to relax with. It's more like... when you are already in some special thoughtful mood, alone in the middle of the night, and want to get immersed in a strange world. The feeling I get from this movie is difficult to explain but it's like...being alone in the middle of...nothingness. At first it was depressing but now it has started to be fascinating and somehow comforting even.If you don't like the movie first time around, give it time, and maybe see later again.Ps.

The Nexus 6 Replicators are units by and for the colonization of other planets that, having been declared outlawed on Earth for disobeying and murdering in a rebellion or mutiny, in a sidereal colony, six males and three females (specifically, it was an assault on a shuttle space) against their higher command, they must be eliminated. They must, therefore, be sought, located and discarded in order to safeguard human lives, as they represent a real danger, due to their strength, as well as their intelligence.Power without control is useless.

The movie is loosely based on Philip K. Dick's \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\". A group of replicants have escaped to Earth and a grizzled veteran Blade Runner named Deckard is dispatched to hunt them down.Blade Runner is a movie with a simple plot. A Blade Runner, played by Harrison Ford, is dispatched to hunt down replicants. Deckard is forced to track down the replicants as well as deal with a contradictory world. The story is fine and serviceable for the movie to explore the interesting world and themes. Blade Runner is a dystopic world run by super corporations that have exceptions made for them.The replicants are used to explore the theme of humanity. As each of the replicants were made for a purpose, the replicants are essentially machines to humans and corporations. However as the story progresses, it becomes clear that the replicants have had fulfilling lives as they embark on one last quest to obtain more life. It is a simple goal, and the movie does this well. The replicants ironically have dreams whereas the human characters are stagnant and do not.Blade Runner is a gorgeous movie. This is a movie that still holds up in today's viewings. The computer generated imagery is dated, but the methods of showing it do not make the computer generated imagery seem fake. The movie prioritizes its characters instead of its visuals.There are many different cuts in this movie that are present on home video. The best cut I found was the final cut. The overall story in each of the cuts are not different. The main differences are how the themes are presented with the deleted scenes.

How disappointed we were. The story, or what passes for it, moves at such a glacial pace, with nothing much happening for most of the time, that we regularly checked our watches. It's difficult to follow what is happening, and why.Deckard seems to be some kind of anti-hero who bumbles and stumbles his way through his assignments. Without serious luck or having his life saved by replicants, he'd have died in each of the four encounters. We learn nothing about him that would make us identify with him, and it's hard to feel involved in or care for what he does.Yes, the visuals look great, but the movie seems to be inspired by seventies European art movies, in which dark and gloomy is mistaken for deep and meaningful. The visuals, combined with the slow pace, brooding humans and deranged replicants may have looked cool in 1982, but in 2021 it just comes across as pretentious and shallow.Every bit of meaning that people seem to project into the movie, they, well, project into it, presumably because it looks dark and gloomy. Plus the movie is sadistic. The violence is gory, and we hated it. It should come with an 18+ rating. I guess it's a new trick to first have a movie rated, and then later edit the gore back in.The scene in which Roy kills his maker is disgusting, and totally unnecessary. Roy is deranged and traumatized and mad with resentment and hates his maker for the limited life-span he's given. We get it. No need to actually show his sadistic handiwork. Unless you think sadistic violence is deep and meaningful of course. What rubbish.As an aside, watching this movie in 2021, it's amazing what people in 1982 thought was going to happen in nearly 40 years. Flying cars? Colonizing planets?

I think one has to be over 40 to really appreciate what this movie has to offer, but it comes off as so narratively bland and straight-forward that I can't help but feel disappointed with every cut (and there are many).The opening couldn't be better. We get thrust into this dark horrible world of an overpopulated dystopian metropolis where it never seems to stop raining, advertisements bombard the populace, and flashing lights periodically invade every nook and cranny. The universe building and the special effects to accomplish it go off the chart in a way few other science fiction movies can achieve. On top of that, the world seems so realistic and lived-in that it's fascinating just to watch the people walk around and the cars float amongst the buildings.However, the plot lacks anything resembling a twist and just goes through the motions on autopilot. It's possibly a victim of the short story not supporting a full feature film, but even then there's a lot of good stuff in Philip K. Dick's original novella that got unfortunately cut. In some respects, I'll say that the recent late sequel works better as a narrative, but even that film has a lot of issues in other areas. For one, effects are no longer the awe inspiring show-stopper that they were back when this film was made.Blade Runner maintains some additional interest in that its villain and friends come off far more sympathetic than the hero. A lot gets left to the imagination, such as the fate of a few of the side characters. However, it spends too much time on the very dry relationship between a wooden Harrison Ford and a wooden Sean Young (though it works for her character). The two actually seem (from their tone and body language) to despise each other which doesn't really give us a lot to root for with them building a forbidden love. We also lose much sense of conflict with the hero \"sort of\" tasked with killing his own lover but he doesn't seem too pressured, either internally or from his superiors. It's an inhuman world but the movie needed a little more of a human heart to fully engage.A groundbreaking film in terms of world building and (like ALIEN and TERMINATOR) I'd love to see more films set in this universe, with the caveat that each film doesn't just follow the exact same formula as sequels tend to do.", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 5}, "heading": "Excellent opening, effects, and production design undercut by blah characters.", "date": "2021-09-06T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7315825"}, {"content": "I watched the sequel first, which blew my mind and became one of my most favorite movies.

But on the basis of those two, it is perhaps easy to understand the acclaim that they have brought him, and the latter - originally mangled by film studios and later attaining cult status - is arguably his masterpiece. 2007's 'The Final Cut' finally saw him exercising complete artistic control over it, and is likely to be regarded as the definitive version.The screenplay for Blade Runner by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples is very loosely based on Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? And is set in a neo-noir near-future (actually 2019) Los Angeles where a group of artificially synthesised Replicants go rogue and decide they want a shot at a normal human life, or at least a normal human lifespan. Harrison Ford's world-weary former detective turned \"blade runner\" Rick Deckard is tasked with hunting them down. The screenplay isn't particularly faithful to Dick's novel and in fact Deckard owes more to the gumshoes of Film Noir than he does to the original prose version, but the film is all the better for it; even Dick reportedly approved of the script and what little he saw of the film, which was released shortly after his death.So why has Blade Runner come to be regarded as such a classic example of film science fiction? For one thing, it is cerebral science fiction, which takes the themes of Dick's novel and brings them to the big screen, throwing in additional questions about what constitutes humanity; the ambiguity as to whether or not Deckard is a Replicant is something that the writers, director and cast disagree on and add to the film's enduring legacy. It also raises questions about identity, reflected in Rachael's ignorance of her Replicant nature due implanted memories. Zhora's slow-motion, agonised death raises the question of whether the Replicants really deserve to be hunted down like animals. The film offers only moral ambiguities: Leon and Roy are both killers, but then they have both been created as slaves and rebelled, as Roy notes during his philosophical final scene.For another, the look of the film, pre-digital and achieving using matte shots, model-work and set design, is astonishing and has had huge influence on science fiction ever since. The moody, rain-soaked future Los Angeles contributes as much to the feel of the story as any of the performances. Scott's Los Angeles is simultaneously seedy and exotic, hi-tech and run-down, and has inspired dozens of imitators. Vangelis score, which combines electronic and classical music, perfectly suits this visual aesthetic. The casting too is near-perfect, with minor roles taken and made memorable by the likes of Edward James Olmos, M. Emmet Walsh, James Hong and Joe Turkel. Ford portrays Deckard as a down-to-Earth everyman in a film filled with oddballs and eccentrics. Sean Young and Daryl Hannah play very different Replicants, the first vulnerable and initially unaware of her true nature, whose innocence proves seductive to Deckard, the second knowingly seductive and exploiting the fact to get close to the na\u00efve and lonely J. F. Sebastian.Rutger Hauer gives the performance of his career as the terrifying, charismatic Roy Batty. Audiences weaned on more conventional science fiction films at the time might have been expecting a climatic final battle between him and Deckard, rather than the poignant and haunting climax that they got, as Roy saves Deckard's life and ends his own with a dignified monologue that has become one of cinema's most quoted. The ending (mangled on the film's original release by meddling studio executives with a hideous tacked on final scene recycling footage filmed for The Shining) is memorably fatalistic, as Deckard flees with Rachael only to be warned by an origami unicorn left by Gaff that nobody lives forever.Scott was reportedly reluctant at first to make Blade Runner, a film with a troubled gestation and one that took years to finally be appreciated in a form that the director was happy with. It is remarkable than that it remains one of the best science films ever made; it is even more remarkable that it took thirty-five years for anyone to make a sequel...", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 4}, "heading": "Scott's masterpiece and one of the greatest science fiction films of all time", "date": "2021-08-23T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7263112"}, {"content": "The similarities between the film and the Philip K. Dick novel are coincidental. If you read Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep you are bound to be disappointed that it is nothing like the film and you cannot imagine Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard.I admire the film more for its technical aspects and stunning visuals. I never had the opportunity to see this on a big screen. I imagine that it was something to behold. But the story itself is more or less just a routine cops and robbers scenario with some sci-fi dressings. When I first saw it it still had the much disliked voiceover narration by Harrison Ford. Many years later I saw one of the numerous alternate cuts which abandoned the narration. I found the film even more dull without it, but removing it from the final moments with Rutger Hauer was absolutely correct and gives the scene a deeper emotional impact as we project our own thoughts at what was happening. It is by far the best scene in the entire film.I am by no means the first person to suggest that the film would have been vastly improved had Rutger Hauer's Batty and the escaped androids been the central characters and Rick Deckard given slightly less screen time, especially the flat romance between him and Rachel (played by Sean Young). It takes up too much screen time and adds nothing of greater interest to the overall story. Both look like they are sleepwalking through their performances. The truly interesting characters are those androids in search of their creator in order to extend their limited lifespan. It is a theme se can all relate to. Just when we've gotten to understand our lives it's over, and all our memories are, as Batty so poignantly states, are lost in time like \"tears in the rain\". But these characters are far from noble or heroic and places us in a moral grey area and suggest the idea: How far would you go to extend your life. Batty, being an android, does not have these moral obstacles and will get to his objective by any means necessary. This could have been a truly thought-provoking film but if not for that final confrontation between Batty and Deckard it would be just an over produced police procedural. The music by Vangelis is quite haunting and adds to the otherworldly quality. The film visually arresting but emotionally empty. It was the first blu-ray I bought on account of those visuals, especially being the age before CGI effects.

The undercooked love story and the goofy action sequences are the inevitable product of its time, but aesthetically it was miles ahead. I recently watched the director's cut 4K remaster and, hairstyles and old TV sets aside, it could almost pass as a fairly recent film. Ridley Scott goes for a neo-noir kind of investigation and paints the dystopian streets of Los Angeles in a decadent, almost gothic tone that reminds of his rainy London.Thematically, the plot raises questions about what it means to be human in a time where there is no perceivable difference between man and machine, to the point that even the nature of memories is to be questioned. These are pretty common reflections in sci-fi literature, and I always thought that \"Blade Runner\" limited itself to giving some cues without digging too deep into the mind of its characters for the sake of the few moments of action (the critics basically did the rest writing pages and pages of overanalyzing). Rick Deckard's motivation for what he does is never fully explored, and so is his rather forced relationship with Rachael. He walks around and defeats one replicant after another like in an arcade fighting game. The film makes a point to show how the androids are more united and human than the morally decayed men of 2019, but little screen time is devoted to exploring their nature.An impressive film for its time and solid cyberpunk neo-noir, but definitely not what I would call an all-time masterpiece.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 3}, "heading": "Still looks amazing", "date": "2021-08-14T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7227464"}, {"content": "Whilst hyped up during the watch of this movie I was amazed by the scenery and cinematography - and EVEN MORE when I remembered this was made back in 1984.The script written for this movie was ridiculously impressive.

For all its robots, flying cars and advanced technology it actually isn't the high speed, action packed movie you might suspect. I think its perfectly alright or better that it isn't, but the picture swings too far to the other side and goes into the realm of dull.I might understand how some viewers might like aspects such as the film's art direction, score or even Harrison Ford. But the cult-like following of Blade Runner take it beyond that type of appreciation and place the film on a height much higher than it deserves.", "rating": 5, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 5, "votes": 9}, "heading": "Doesn't Live Up To The Hype At All", "date": "2021-06-14T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw7028898"}, {"content": "Blade Runner is a film that is by Ridley Scott ( Alien), that came out in 1982. This movie has stunning visuals, and a great story line. Their are about 4 different versions of the movie. The version I like the best is the one, Deckard ( Harrison Ford), and his mini-narrative. His thoughts, and characters background. He doesn't talk throughout the movie, but his narrative explains it more.This is the director's Cut, which is really good. I didn't see this movie until I was in my 20's. I was blown away by the opening scene. The story is about Synthetic Humans that were created to work on off-word colonies. They were designed with a 4 year life span. This was a fail safe measure, encase they decided to turn on their creator. They are also referred as Replicates or Skin-Jobs, and are very unpredictable. When 4 Replicates escape from an off -world colonies an alert goes out to the enforcers or BLADE RUNNERS. They are looking for two males and two females. The leader is Roy Batty ( Late Rudgar Hauer), Leon ( Brion James ), Pris ( Daryl Hannah), and Zhora ( Joanna Cassidy). They are headed back to Earth to seek a longer life span. They want to find Tyrell ( James Turkel), and are willing to do anything or stop anybody from getting in their way. Leon is the most dangerous, when he was interviewed, he almost kills is interviewer ( Mark Arnold).Deckard is a burnt out cop/Blade Runner who is the best. He is called back to track down the 4 and kill them. He works alongside Gaff ( Edward James Olmos). When Deckard is called by The Tyrell Cor. To interview Tyrell's assistant Racheal. He is shocked because she is young and gorgeous. It takes him longer, but Deckard discovers she is a replicaint. Tyrell says she is the best work he has created, which took Deckard longer to find out. She believe she is human, but Deckard tells her it's all fake memories. They begin a relationship and knows he has to protect her from other Blade Runners, especially his boss who knows what she is. Deckard begins to eliminate the replicants, but two remain Pris and Batty. They are very dangerous and find Sebastian. He also works with Tyrell, and is brilliant. Sebastian doesn't realize he is being played, they just friend him til they can get to Tyrell. When Batty meets Tyrell, he kills him and Sebastian. The reason he would not give into his demands of a longer lifespan.Deckard is called along with Gaff to investigate. He realizes he must eliminate the last 2. In order to keep Rachael safe he keeps her at his place until he returns. His plan is to leave with her after the job is done. He finds Batty and Pris, Pris almost kills him, but he is able to escape then she blows a socket. So Roy is the last, but he doesn't give up. It is a back and fourth game with the two. Batty knows his time is about up, and when a mishap happens he save Deckard from certain death. The two look at each other with Batty releasing a Dove, then he dies.When Deckard returns he realizes Gaff has been in is apartment, because he leaves clues( origami). When he fears the worst, he runs over to check on Rachael, she is still alive. The two leave fearing what would happen if he stayed. This is a great film which I have always wondered if Deckard was a Repliciant or not.

The film is a true masterpiece that presented its world very differently and in a unique way that no one can create especially during the time which the film was released (the 80s).Ridley Scott directed the film perfectly. The characters were so unique and interesting especially that the film left us with so many unanswered questions about them and other things so it made the fans want to know more about the characters and the story itself. The dialogues/monologues were so interesting and sometimes deep with their meanings, and yes I'm talking about the famous, incredible, and deep monologue \"Tears in Rain\" or the \"C-Beams Speech\" that although it was only 42 words, people still talk about how beautiful it is until this day and they will continue talking about it of course. Rutger Hauer (Plays Roy Batty) made this monologue/scene even better with his facial expressions and voice tone. It was also him who changed some of the words of this monologue from the original script a day before the shooting of this scene so the result would be the one we all watched in the film.The perfect music score of Vangelis was so unique and different and did fit that futuristic world of Blade Runner perfectly. It also did fit every scene whether it was a love/romantic scene, or a scene where the Blade Runner is chasing someone or being chased by someone, or even an emotional/deep scene like the \"Tears in Rain\" monologue that had a piece of perfect music playing in the background that was called \"Tears in rain\" too.Really loved Harrison Ford's performance as Rick Dickered. He played the role of the Blade Runner perfectly. Sean Young as Racheal was able to convince me that she is a \"Replicant\". In my opinion, anyone who played the role of a \"Replicant\" in the film, did it more than well and they all convinced me.Jordan Cronenweth's cinematography was great and it was able to capture the futuristic world in a way that'll blow your mind especially when it comes to showing buildings that had these futuristic/beautiful billboards, or even the flying cars. This brings me to the production design that worked so well alongside the cinematography to capture this beautiful big world.Loved how the film left us with so many unanswered questions (that even most of them aren't answered in the sequel \"Blade Runner 2049\"). Because this makes the film more debatable and we get to hear the different theories and opinions.Great film that introduced us to a beautiful, big, complex, and futuristic world.

I first tried to watch Blade Runner (of what I believe was The Final Cut) on TV in Christmas 2009, only to stop watching after half an hour due to boredom. Over the years, however, I would be compelled to return to Blade Runner several times and get more out of it with each viewing. The tech-noir world of Blade Runner is one to get lost in with its use of neon and many billboards of geishas, albeit a more depressing, dystopian one than say that of Star Wars; one in which the city of Los Angeles appears to be stuck in a state of perpetual darkness and it very frequently rains. Now when watching Blade Runner, I'm watching a movie set in the past date of November, 2019. Once again, like Star Wars, the technology present is highly contradictory, this is a world in which flying cars exist and photographs have unimaginably high pixel counts, yet they still use CRT televisions and mobile phones don't appear to exist. It contradictions like these which we can observe in the real world just adds to the unique and fantasy aspect of the Blade Runner universe.The visual style of Blade Runner has since become a massive clich\u00e9 - often imitated but never equaled. It feels like every shot or background prop has a story to tell such as those many photographs in Rick Deckard's apartment. The man-cave interior of Deckard's apartment is perfectly suited to his loner personality, a classic world-weary noir protagonist. The film's blurring of the lines between what is human and what is machine results in me always having to remind myself that these replicants of whose plight I've drawn emotional investment towards, are not humans at the end of the day. Why should I feel sorry for the vulnerable replicant Rachael with her smudged eye makeup created from her tears? Blade Runner provokes many a thought of what it means to be human. I suspect the appearance of Rachael must have come about from a desire to create an ideal woman since nobody else in Blade Runner casually dresses like a 1940's femme fatale (I haven't heard of anyone else note Rachael has a strong resemblance to Rosalind Russell in My Sister Eileen from 1942). Likewise, I don't want to know if Deckard is a replicant or not, I prefer the ambiguity and the mystery along with the many unanswered questions of this universe.The love scene between Deckard and Rachael is one of the greatest in cinema history. The sexual tension builds up as a shirtless Deckard wipes away the blood of his face and Rachael lets her hair loose. Subsequently, the manner in which Deckard prevents Rachael from leaving the apartment as he shuts the door with his fist and then proceeds to kiss her along with the saxophone solo from the love them being as close to cheesy as it can get without it being so, brings the swoon factor up to 11. My shallow desires just wish the extended, deleted version of the scene was left in any of the version of the film (in the 80's Sean Young got to have a sex scene with both Harrison Ford and Kevin Costner).The effects of globalization as seen in Blade Runner present L. A. (or at the very least one portion of the city) having Japanese inhabitants as the majority population. If the filmmakers were intending to make accurate predictions of the future, the world of Blade Runner would be more likely dominated by Chinese influence. What Blade Runner does reflect accurately about our modern world is the increasingly oppressive corporate culture and the surveillance of everyday life. There are no evident signs of government in Blade Runner yet corporations rule the roast as the Mayan pyramid-shaped headquarters of the Tyrell Corporation dominates the skyline. Like Cyberdyne Systems in The Terminator and Omni Consumer Products in Robocop, 1980's pulp sci-fi tried to warn us of the dangers of unbridled corporate power. Such power is seen turning in on itself as the film's corporate overlord, the slimy, dubious Eldon Tyrell with his magnificent glasses succumbs to a gruesome death in the only moment of the film in which I want to avert my eyes from the screen in a classic case of the Frankenstein monster turning on its creator. It's little often pointed out that Tyrell's death is very similar to the murder of Mr. Gaines in The Manchurian Candidate (1962). In both films, the murders take place at night in the victim's bedroom as they are lying in bed reading. Both characters are wearing a robe while having a chessboard, statues of animals and candles next to their beds.Lucas and Spielberg gave special editions a bad name, but Ridley Scott's Final Cut of Blade Runner actually shows they have a place (providing the option of viewing the original still exists). There are no pointless CGI additions and it fixes the niggling technical flaws of the original such as the shot of Roy Batty's dove flying towards the sky. While I appreciate the Final Cut, there is a charm to those imperfections of the original, showing that even the masters can make mistakes. I will also defend the voice-over narration present in the theatrical version. It's not up to the poetic quality of Fred MacMurray in Double Indemnity and is hokey but I find it endearingly so and does make the plot easier to follow and gives the film a bit more character (plus we get to hear Harrison Ford drop the \"N\" word).Blade Runner is by no means a nihilistic film, rather it is one that shows beauty in despair (the original ending shows that green pastures apparently still exist in this world of ecological ruin). This display of goodness, truth and beauty culminates in Roy Batty's final 42 word Tears In The Rain monologue, as the obviously Christ-like figure conjures magnificent images of Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion and C-beams glittering in the dark near the Tannh\u00e4user Gate to the magnificent score by Vangelis. The Blade Runner soundtrack is one of the few film scores in which I can listen to the entire thing (even John Williams Ladd Company jingle is awe-inspiring). It is the perfect accompaniment to walking down any urban landscapes at night (I can recall multiple mornings when I would listen to Tears In The Rain as the sun would rise back when I worked night shifts) as oneself reflects over its romantic nature and harkens for nostalgia, often and like the replicants in the movie, for memories we don't even have.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 6, "votes": 8}, "heading": "I've Seen The Future And It Will Be", "date": "2021-04-18T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6827066"}, {"content": "It really doesn't get any better than \"Blade Runner\".

Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep. Despite failing to generate much of an audience on its original release due to misguided marketing and a terribly botched theatrical cut, the film slowly but surely garnished a massive following to the point of being hailed as one of the greatest sci-fi movies ever made, as well as best films ever made, partially thanks to its reformed final cuts. That being said, while I admire the film's legacy, let's just say I respect it more than I enjoy it.Set in a dystopian future Los Angeles around 2019, where synthetic humans called replicants have been bio-engineered by the Tyrell Corporation to work in space, a group of fugitive advanced replicants led by Roy Batty escape back to Earth. So it's all up to a jaded cop Rick Deckard to hunt them down while dealing with an emotional replicant named Rachel who wishes to be human. Right off the bat, what makes the movie iconic is the world building, as the entire setting of this futuristic Los Angeles is just oozing with gritty atmosphere and a frightening aroma of criminal activity going around. In a way, the film mixes neo-noir with sci-fi in a very unique setting that it allows the environments to speak for themselves. Also, the aforementioned replicants are quite fascinating in concept, especially with how determined they are to get back at the Tyrell corporation for their poor treatment of them, and the likes of Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Brion James and Joanna Cassidy bring each character to life in their own special ways, even if Hauer steals the show with Roy Batty's subtly haunting demeanor.Speaking of performances, Harrison Ford really sells the mentally exhausted Deckard to the point where we as the viewers can identify with him the most. Knowing all the complicated details that go behind the caper and the occasional action packed sequences that show up, it allows for Deckard to thoroughly use his brains as opposed to his brawn, like a real detective. However, outside of Deckard and the replicants, the remaining cast ranges from general plot conveniences to underdeveloped potential, as the movie would rather focus on the specific mission than make them really stand out. The only true stand out is J.F. Sebastian, the genetic designer who Pris and Roy manipulate to get back at Tyrell. In addition to his fondness for crafting exquisitely elaborate toys, he ends up having a similar predicted fate as the replicants, making him just as sympathetic as them. It's characters like that which make the story more engaging than it might have been beforehand thanks to the added bits of substance you don't often get in the sci-fi genre.With that said though, what does keep me from deeming Blade Runner great is how slowly paced it is. I'm all for a neo-noir crime thriller to take its time in solving the case, but the down to earth maturity makes the film feel more hollow than if it was more action packed. Also, despite being interesting in theory, Rachel isn't really given enough screen time to be as memorable as she could have been, and whenever she does show up, it usually just has to do with her coming to an emotional resonance around Deckard (not helped by an unsettling and unnecessary implied romance). Not to mention, by the time the movie gets to the third act in resolving the crime case, it just ends off in a standard suspenseful shoot 'em up, not uncommon in other crime flicks. Finally, because there are so many cuts of the movie, you may end up with a different view depending on which one you watch. Granted, it was nice to view the final cut, but when the theatrical cut has a happy ending that is tonally disconnected from the film's intended tone, that will just leave more to be desired than satisfied.So all in all, while Blade Runner might not be a personal favorite, even I can't deny the amazing impact it left on cinema. Had it not been for its underground status that led it to being hailed as a classic, we wouldn't have other innovative sci-fi media like Battlestar Galactica, Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Deus Ex, etc. Seeing as how the film eventually spawned its own sequel made more than 30 years after its original release, its legacy lives on for new generations to come.

It moves deliberately slow, allowing you to take in all the sights and sounds of 2019 Los Angeles (as imagined in 1982), whilst pondering some of the themes it presents.If you want to know more about the philosophical themes in significant depth, I suggest you google 'Blade Runner Themes and Motifs'. A simple Welshman like myself would for the purpose of a review rather scratch the surface and say that the imagery and dialogue associated with what defines a sentient being and what makes us human is compellingly portrayed. The device used to explore these themes is the genetically engineered humanoid life-form, the godlike status of its creator and the morally compromised nature of the ordinary human. Additionally the number of references to the eyes and linking of what we see and remember versus what is fake and reality, is cleverly mixed into the story.The character of Roy Batty has been interpreted as both a religious and philosophical allegory, but these types of theories can be argued until the sheep come home. He is for me the most intriguing character in the movie and his final scene is one of the most memorable of all time. Along with Deckard, it made me actually wonder if there is any real difference between humans and replicants. He is portrayed wonderfully by Rutger Hauer who both looks and acts the part.Deckard is impressively played by Harrison Ford, who is perfect for movies with such an emphasis on visuals. Ninety percent of Ford's power as an actor comes from his striking visual presence and soulful facial expressions. His scenes with Sean Young young are as emotionally touching as the action scenes are brutal.One of Blade Runner's most memorable aspects is its depiction of 2019 Los Angeles, with its permanently dark rainy skies, overcrowding, neon lights, high concept technology, urban decay and environmental devastation. Take away the flying cars and off-world colonies and it's not far off an accurate prediction.I could write for hours about the cinematography, artistic designs and special effects, but there's nothing I can say that would do it justice. You should watch every incredibly atmospheric frame of Blade Runner and absorb what Ridley Scott is showing you.The much argued question of whether Deckard is a replicant or a human is interesting. There is evidence on both sides of the argument and you must watch the movie to decide. I ask myself, does it really matter? Personally, I think in the grand scheme of the movie it matters as much as whether Welshmen dream of inflatable sheep.

You can imagine then how I felt when it became apparent that Director Ridley Scott wanted to remove both! Whether you see the 'Director's Cut' or the recent 'Final Cut', Blade Runner is simply a dystopian visual masterpiece about where mankind is heading and the consequences of creating ever more complex AI. Loosely based on the Phil Dick novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' Scott's vision is a dark, resonant, neon-lit cityscape, where giant Corporate adverts play in the rainy gloom. Rick Deckard is a 'Blade Runner' - an investigator who hunts down any 'replicants' (artificially created human-forms) who have rebelled against their programming. The new Nexus 6 are a problem - if they can imitate human behaviour well enough - they may be able to fool the Test that differentiates Humans from Replicants and several of the new Nexus 6 have arrived back on earth for reasons that are not immediately apparent.\nThe entire Film poses a fundamental question - when do artificially created entities become sentient? What rights do they have, if any? Do they 'become' Human or merely imitate our feelings? There are no easy answers here.\nThis is NOT Science Fiction in the Terminator-type vein - explosions, battle scenes etc. This is REAL Science Fiction, where it builds a credible world to ask difficult Questions - and what a world it is. We can forget now how extraordinary Blade Runner looked in 1982 when it was first released and maybe the reason it looks slightly more familiar these days is because the World DOES look more like the L.A of Blade Runner. Indeed, many Far-Eastern Cities look unerring like this. The design of the Film is stunning and inspired countless generations of Designers, not to mention Film Directors - Blade Runner has influenced Film like no other Science Fiction Film has.\nThe Cinematography is astounding - it just couldn't be anything else if you mix Ridley Scott with Jordan Cronenweth - the sheer look of the City, the streets and the interiors, all lit in a dark foreboding shadow-scape, are as 'Noir' as you can get. The Cast are superb, Harrison Ford has never been better and the support he gets from the likes of Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Joe Turkel etc is spot on. The score by Vangelis fits the atmosphere PERFECTLY - the scenes in Deckard's apartment to his 'memories of green' - are just pure Art.\nIn conclusion, this is a Science Fiction Film that takes it's subject seriously and consequently builds it's world to a standard that is rarely matched in Cinema. Many point to Kubrick's '2001' as the finest Film in this genre - I disagree - Ridley Scott's dark dystopian beauty has quietly stolen that crown.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Beautiful Dystopia - the greatest most influential Sci-Fi Film ever made", "date": "2021-01-27T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6534373"}, {"content": "Stunning visuals, and interesting worldbuilding. only critique is that the 3rd act lost a lot of momentum, and the ending therefore was a little less impactfull. but apart from that this is still one of the best films I've seen in a long time8/10: ooga booga", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "ah yes", "date": "2021-01-27T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6533407"}, {"content": "The best movie in a genre the Cyberpunk.

It is noteworthy how visionary director Ridley Scott was, as globalization so widespread in recent decades, finds in this film, a catastrophic, melancholy and depressing ending - extinct animals are cloned and replicated following the main portion in the film - human replicants; the existence of a profusion of cultures, ethnicities, creeds and customs. Indeed, Mexicans, Chinese, Arabs and a whole range of cultures live together in this dark and discouraging environment.In addition to winning the famous cult movie title, Blade Runner is still considered one of the most influential films of the 1980s, both visually and by the suggestive script itself. In the film, the futuristic Earth of 2019 is the stage for a discussion on the right to life. More precisely, with regard to the very notion of life. When creating replicants, androids \"more human than humans\", do we have the right to use them as tools? Is a creature capable of developing feelings inferior to us because it was created out of our knowledge? If we can create a life form that can subdue our species, should we do that? These are questions posed by science fiction since then. From Artificial Intelligence to Westworld, through Jurassic Park and The Terminator, we always see human intelligence building its own extinction.If creating life out of nothing is read by various religions as proof of divine existence, the creation of the replicants elevates man to the level of God. And, in parallel with the Christian God of the Old Testament, our response to \"rebellious children\" is controlling, Manichaean and angry. In the textual preamble of Blade Runner, we are told that the ban on androids on our planet is a retaliation for their revolt at the condition of slaves. Just as God banished Adam and Eve from Paradise for eating the Forbidden Fruit, the \"apple\" that removed the innocence of the replicants was the conscience of their own bondage and the desire for freedom. What makes \"Eden\" paradoxical is its state: The Earth has been reduced to a great suburb, relegated to peripheral ethnicities (there are many Asian types in Blade Runner) and, mostly, to the poor. The rich can find true \"paradise\" in colonies off the planet. This idea of interplanetary segregation, it is worth noting, was taken up at Elysium. The replicants are banned from Earth precisely because the humans they are to serve are no longer here, but scattered throughout the Galaxy.On this dirty and marginal planet (a setting clearly inspired by film noir), the \"detective\" is the android runner hunter, \"Blade Runner\", Rick Deckard, forcibly removed from his retirement to \"retire\" the four fugitive replicants who entered the Earth. His investigation follows the same modus operandi as classic police films: informants from the streets, \"little fish\" thugs who are forced to give information to get rid of their own skin and an unexpected love affair. But, unlike the classic genre, Deckard is not the thread of the plot. The audience knows where the story is going to put its nemesis, the leader of the replicants Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), a character intentionally built to show intelligence and humanity equivalent to those of his hunter. Roy, in further evidence that Ridley Scott built his film on biblical parables, is literally called by Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel), its creator, \"prodigal son\".\nRoy is a character given to reinterpretations. In his presentation, he quotes America: A Prophecy, by William Blake, replacing a verb. \"Flamed, the angels arose\" becomes \"flamed, the angels fell\". This \"mistake\", which can be considered a sign of the fallibility of androids, would also explain the human characteristic present in them. A machine cannot analyze a literary work and adapt it to different contexts on a symbolic level. A human, yes. Roy and his companions found that their generation of androids is short-lived. In four years, they \"die\". That's why they return to Earth. Because they want to live longer. A basic desire of human nature in the face of the awareness of its finitude. He then seeks his creator, moved by the faith that he can help him. He discovers, however, that it is impossible, which reveals the weakness and impotence of the one who created it. Therefore, he denies and kills with his own hands the one who believed he was able to save him from death. Symbolically kills his only faith.The Voight-Kampff Test itself, a version of Philip K. Dick for the Turing Test, used to define who is human and who is replicant, raises a fundamental question: whether a machine is capable of developing feelings, something established by Tyrell in a conversation with Deckard, the Test may fail. Between Rachael (Sean Young), who believes he has lived memories that are not hers, but that provoke genuinely his feelings, and a psychopath, capable of committing heinous crimes without feeling empathy for the victims, where is the humanity of the second? At a philosophical level, it is fair to question whether the replicants do not have the human spark in them, as they were made in our image and likeness, just as, by Christian mythology, we have the Divine spark, because we were made in His image and likeness. This is the moment when the film confronts its protagonist with a possibility never before imagined by him. If a replicant can ignore his condition as a machine through the implantation of memories, what guarantees that he himself is not also one of them and his memories are all false?And this ambiguity about what defines humanity, whether the essence or existence (Pris, a replicant played by Daryl Hannah, quotes Descartes' \"I think, therefore I am\"), creates the best mystery in Blade Runner: Deckard is also a replicant? Ignoring comments from stakeholders and analyzing only filmic aspects, it is possible to say yes. On his piano, the score of Largo da Opera \"Xerxes\", by the German-British H\u00e4ndel. The play is an adaptation of a work by Giovanni Bononcini, which in turn adapted from Francesco Cavalli. Comparatively, a replicant is an adaptation of Man, which is an adaptation of God. Rachael previously questions Deckard if he has ever applied the Voight-Kampff Test to himself, and is answered silently. And, on the clearest clue of all, Gaff (Edward James Olmos), the same cop who recruited Deckard at the beginning of the film, leaves an origami unicorn at his door. Deckard had dreamed of a unicorn during the film, information he doesn't share with anyone. Just as he knew about Rachael's memories because they were not really hers, it is not absurd to imagine that Gaff knew about the unicorn because that memory was also implanted in Deckard.Harrison Ford's character takes on this ambiguity in an exceptional dimension, as it transcends his character and reaches his own condition, raising profound ethical questions related to his ambiguous nature: man or replicant? If he is really a replicant, the awareness of this puts him at the center of a tragedy: that of being an exterminator of his own kind. It is the curse of knowing, the curse of knowing yourself. Within ignorance, none of that mattered. However, once confronted with its existential condition, ethics imposes itself as a burden and its actions gain another perspective and density.Blade Runner is challenging and requires refined symbolic reasoning from its viewer to be understood, mainly by asking questions rather than offering answers. The visual construction of a decrepit Los Angeles, the direction of Scott that privileges the word over the action (although it does not neglect it in any way), and the iconic soundtrack created by the Greek musician Vangelis, made of purely melancholy chords, are elements that come into line to highlight the depth of the topics covered. Blade Runner is, without a doubt, one of the great science fiction films, less for its futuristic / visionary character, and more for the way it searches these existential questions, fitting them pertinently in the conflicts and contradictions of what is to come.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Blade Runner is a great science fiction films, for its visual and existential questions, fitting them pertinently in the conflicts and contradictions of what is to come", "date": "2020-11-28T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6318802"}, {"content": "On late eighties I used to reading a review at newspaper over the movies that'll be aired on week and thru this info l made my planning of my movie section on the night, was schedule to weekend Blade Runner which I never saw, according the famous reviewer Blade Runner was flopped on the box office, the audience didn't liked the Ridley Scott's offering, well watching this picture the proposal enthrall me deeply, how would be Los Angeles in 2019, an overcrowded dark city, with several ethnicities like Chinese, Indian and all sort of people working on narrow streets, including hidden replicants, created by Tyron Corporation, a kind of human being developed to work up at outer space on those hazardous mining activities in others planets, they had just four year of lifetime and they aren't allowed live on earth, although after a successful mutiny six of them escapes to Earth, Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) as Blade Runner has an unwield assignment, finds out and destroy all them, L.A. has a bleak atmosphere seems nearly with Fritz Lang's Metropolis, including an iconic building at downtown, the painstaking director Ridley Scott had a total control of the movie's concept, managing with iron hand all departments at own relish, had a cohesive cast as Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Daryl Hannah, Joanna Cassidy, Edward J.

For me, it is the second best (behind only 2001: A Space Odyssey) and one of the best films ever made. It is a 10/10 grade work with praise, it is a movie that gets better every time I watch it again, and I've watched it several times. It is one of the most reusable films for me, and every time I watch it, I discover something that I didn't notice the other time I watched it. I consider this the best film by legendary director Ridley Scott (and I say this knowing the merits of the masterpieces that are Gladiator and Alien).The final cut of this film is a masterpiece. It is much better musically, cinematographed and directed than the \"normal\" version. The additional scenes really make a stark difference here. Blade Runner is a film that was way ahead of its time. There are layers, philosophy, messages and meanings that are something that does not make this film a film that is just about a policeman going back to his work and doing what he already did. And even if it were just that, the film would be great already. To this day, there are many discussions about how complex Deckard is. Harrison Ford plays a great role as a character who has passions, dualities, humanity, but at the same time I thought he was a replicant. The famous \"Unicorn Scene\" gives several huge perspectives on what he really is, (or if he doesn't know what he is, as he himself indirectly speaks in a part of the film about Rachel).The film is visually magnificent. Its cyberpunk atmosphere of futuristic Los Angeles combined with excellent and revolutionary cinematography, coming from a director as visual as Scott, is one of the most beautiful films ever made. This super cool look becomes one of the most immersive films ever made. We entered, we plunged into that dystopia in a way that it is almost possible to smell that place. The bars, the streets, the interiors, everything is very immersive.Blade Runner's original soundtrack (especially from Final Cut) is mind-boggling. It can skillfully capture suspense, romance, existentialism, fear, fury, redemption, giving up ... It is also just one of the many reasons why this film is all of that.The secondary characters in Blade Runner are mostly fantastic. It is impossible to explain the greatness of each one of them, who fit this great script well.In the end, Blade Runner's Final Cut (1982) solidly materializes as one of the greatest films ever made. Many people say that this movie is \"boring\", but not a movie about wild explosions and wild action like any Marvel movie. But it is a film that does not have a fast pace.

It is from the year 1982, so it will soon have its 40th aniversary and maybe this happened already depending on when you read my review. It runs for minimally under two hours and is based on a novel by Philip K. Dick, who sadly died of heart failure only months before this film got released. The two writers in charge of the screenplay here were Fancher and Oscar nominee Webb Peoples and both are still alive in their 80s now. But the big name here is of course director Ridley Scott, who has worked on many big movies over the course of his really long career, but the fact that this one here is a massive contender for being his biggest career success still says it all about the film's popularity. The one person where this is probably not a contender for most popular film is lead actor Harrison Ford, but this is only because he was also a crucial player in the Star Wars franchise. And let's not forget about Indiana Jones of course. I have never been a big fan of either and consequently also not a big fan of Ford, but he was alright here. The fact that he does not necessarily play a very likable man as I would say is kinda explained at the end. But I will get to that later.First, a few more words on the cast: There are many cast members in smaller roles that I am not familiar with, even if they are/were also prolific actors. But one mention goes out to Sean Young, who plays the maybe most interesting character from this film. Easily the most stunning though I would say. Daryl Hannah's character is called \"perfect\" on one occasion by another character, but I could not disagree more. Young is perfect here in my opinion. Then again, I have always had a soft spot for dark-haired girls, so certainly biased here. So I mentioned Hannah now, she was very young here of course and most people are also familiar with her from the Kill Bill films and I must admit I did not even remember she was in this film here although, especially with the makeup, her character here is pretty memorable and interesting too. The scene right before the fight when she is in disguise in a similar manner like Bond going against Scaramanga was nice too, but Ford/Deckard is too much of a professional to not spot her quickly, even if he is still taken by surprise by her. Edward James Olmos, another very established actor in here, also plays an interesting character who kind of could have deserved his own film too. And last but not least, Rutger Hauer. Sadly he passed away not too long ago, but this film is maybe his most iconic performance and with the twist towards the end, I can totally see why. He is strong, he is ruthless, but he is much more than that. I will elaborate a bit on that later on.Just one more thing here about the main character and his love interest: We see the two leave eventually and it's not safe to say if others will be on their tails, on her tail especially, but the scene with the little thingey on the ground in the end implies that they may have gotten help from the Asian guy, who made it look as if she was dead, so nobody will know she is still alive and on the run. Actually, a strong premise for a sequel too and that sequel came, but no less than 35 years later and I must say I did not like the sequel at all, maybe because I hadn't seen or wasn't too familiar with the original, but then again it should never be essential to have seen a film in order to appreciate another. Still, it got Roger Deakins an Oscar finally, so it's good it exists. Also, another interesting thing about the original here is that it is set in 2019 as we find out at the very start, so in the past now as we are in 2020. Always an interesting aspect how people saw the future back then.Okay, now I want to elaborate a bit on the story and scenes and inclusions that I liked the most. Must initially give a brief summary of the premise. Mankind created replicants, man-like creatures that are as smart as the smartest men and stronger than the strongest. And they are very pain-resistent too. On one occasion, they said that the only way to hurt them, is to kill them. However, conflicts arose and war was declared against said replicants who were at distant planets and had to work as slaves. In this movie, six replicants manage to flee and come to planet Earth. Two of them were killed immediately and a bit of a pity that we find out nothing else about those. The other four get decent inclusions though, at least two of them also considerable screen time. The snake woman does not. She is the first who gets found by Deckard and he manages to take her down after a fight. Immediately afterwards, the protagonist runs into the second replicant and is basically caught with his pants down by him (just metaphorically), but luckily an unexpected ally is there to save his life. Two remain.Hannah's character is the third. It is kinda interesting how Deckard takes down one by one just like the Bride does in \"Kill Bill\". Anyway, as for this one here, Hannah is eventually still at her buddy Sebastian's home and that place is indeed very creepy somehow and extremely bizarre with all the lights and of course the mechanical creatures that Sebastian considers his friends. He is a weirdo, but not an evil man. He has no real choice other than helping the replicants. Hauer's character is mostly interested in an idea how he can keep himself alive for more than four years. Or actually cares more about keeping Hannah's character alive. This is how long the replicants have. Not a lot. There is a good quote about a parallel they have compared to light bulbs. And that is why he wants to see Joe Turkel's character and well, of course it is pretty shocking and violent and brutal how the latter gets murdered eventually, but you can make a bit of a point for this being not motivated by hate or anything, but just by hopelessness and desparation against the man who caused this by creating the replicants with a life span of four years and there is no option to have them live longer as we find out while they discuss all kinds of scientific processes.Now, the one thing I want to elaborate on most of all here is the definition of who is the offender and who is the victim. We follow Ford's character and he represents one side here and of course we side with him sooner or later, but at the same time we forget how he was recruited here early on. He had no choice, but was literally forced by his boss to follow his orders. Apparently, he worked for him or for the agency in the past already and he clearly was not happy at all with it back then and just hoped he could get away, but he has no choice. Maybe the one thing missing here a bit is an explanation of why they are called blade runners, but that is just a minimal criticism. Anyway, take a look at how Ford's character shoots the first replicant. She is running from him, trying to be safe, to get away, but gets murdered in cold blood. You can call it that. There is not too much to say about the second victim. Of course, it is another fight about life and death for him. But seeing Hannah's character die is also very telling being in disguise before that and eventually on the ground like a severely wounded animals. That is what the replicants are: Animals. Slaves. But all their violence results from what was done to them and not from being evil or anything. Not at all.Then with Hauer's character, there is the big revelation. Yes he breaks Deckard's fingers, but he does so because his loved ones were taken from him and apparently he also knew that it was not Deckard who killed the other male replicant, so only two fingers. Also pay attention to the hands. Roy (Hauer) easily could have broken Deckard's hand in that situation, maybe torn it off even, but he lets go. And his own hand is very injured. It may be the wildness, the muscles we see as Hauer's character runs around topless that has him appear like a beast to us, but that is what he is, again an injured monster and one who is stronger than the others. He is called the prodigal son for good reason earlier. And when we have that shot outside in the pouring rain with Deckard being in danger of falling to his death, but Roy lends him a hand and pulls him up before dying himself making his last deed an act of mercy shows us that he is not evil and neither are the other replicants. That camera shot from down there pointing up to Roy with the dove in his hand is pretty massive and very memorable, also how he lets the dove go in the moment of his death. Okay, maybe a bit unrealistic that this exact moment the Asian guy is there, but okay. Everything before that was so brilliant that I can accept it.In-between, I had several moments where I thought I could actually give this four stars out of five and not just three and thus declare it as one of 1982's finest, but the final sequence with Hauer's character on the chase was initially a bit underwhelming I felt, so I was hesitant, but the final twist and explanation about goodness, mercy and perspective (like I said in the title of my review) were just too good to be ignored. The film also could have ended the moment Hauer's character died, but the epilogue is also tolerable I suppose, even if it was not necessarily required. Without it, we would have thought that Rachael left and will not be followed and hunted down by Deckard as he owes her. That's what he said himself. But yeah, it's the message about (not just) slavery and about people only wanting the best for them without being evil. Only being heartbroken and disappointed may bring out the worst in them. Or how it matters so much from which perspective you watch a movie in how you perceive the characters. But they are 100% authentic, also showing their \"love\" in front of Sebastian.

Dick's novel, Blade Runner is more of a commentary on the role of technology in society. And the depths and lengths to which it goes to explore the issue are incredible. It's a film with layered characters, dialogue laden with undertone and a whole lot of metaphor and motif.Harrison Ford has found his own in another role seemingly written for him. He plays the disenchanted protagonist excellently (a la Star Wars and Indiana Jones), and this time is met with a wonderful opposite in Rutger Hauer's Roy, an antagonist whose morality and motives are put into question right until the end of the film. It's one of those stories that offers more questions than it does answers, leaving you pondering what it all meant and what happens next.I always enjoy a film that leaves its thematic question open to interpretation.

This is a film that doesn't contain an abundance of action but rather focuses more on the world we're presented with and for me that's the biggest selling point. For a film that came out in 1982, it's impressive how amazing the production design is. Ridley Scott fully immerses you into this dystopian, futuristic universe and the beautiful music composed for this film adds a layer of atmosphere to it. Alongside that Scott gives us a story that deals with a lot of themes. Whether it's relating to memories or what it means to be human, Blade Runner provides us with something really unique and complex. It surprised me how deep this film actually goes once you actually analyse it.People may be upset by the slow pacing and lack of action but I loved the way Scott told this story. This is what separates Blade Runner from other sci-fi films and it's the slower pacing that lets the viewer soak in the film's dystopian atmosphere and philosophical messages. The performances are great especially Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer who are a treat to watch.Blade Runner is certainly not a film for everyone.

First time I gave this movie an 8 but after the second viewing I give this movie a 6. This a mess of a movie with shallow characters, uninteresting plot, messy script and weird performances. The visuals, music and cinematography are the only things that are good in this movie. But to what good are these, when you can't transmit a message through the story, characters and dialogues? The visuals only enhance the experience but when you have no experience what is there then to enhance? You can skip the part where I break down the plot of the movie.Plot breakdown:\nSo the movie begins with a short text describing the state in which the world is at the time the movie happens. But there is no effort put in explaining how the world got there or some kind of context to what is happening in order to care about what happens. And people (myself included) hate the new Star Wars for having no context to their stories, but the same people love this movie for basically doing the same thing. Next we see an interview which ends with the person being interviewed shooting the interviewer, even though he appeared to be a prisoner with no weapon with him. The problems with this scene are 1. we have no idea who these people are and 2. we don't know why that is relevant to the plot. Next we meet Deckard who is a former Blade Runner who used to retire robots known as Replicants. He gets a mission of retiring 4 Replicants that have gone rogue\nbut again the problem with this scene is that the person giving him this task doesn't explain it properly so basically the viewer is still in the dark about what is going on in this movie and why should he be invested in it. The movie however does something good next and that these two go and see the 4 Replicants on a monitor screen. That sheds some light on who is who and why is that relevant to the plot. Next Deckard goes to the creator of the robots named Tyrell. There he meets a Replicant named Rachel and he starts questioning her to see if she is a human or a Replicant. The problem here is that I as a viewer have no idea about this questioning and how someone should respond as a human to it and how should a Replicant respond to that. So basically I was bored to tears and not captivated durign this scene. Not to mention not being able to see the so-called or claimed to be philosoficall questioins or themes this scenes rises. I'm sorry movie! Then Deckard finds a clue and then investigates and finds the first Replicant. But I have to be honest, I haven't seen more uninteresting and uncaptivating detecting skills than this couple of scenes in this movie, in any other movie ever! Nothing is known to me so that I may observ how Deckard finds another angle to it and finds out something I missed. It's just plain bad and boring! So he tracks the first Replicator also a female and shoots her. Then Leon the second Replicant finds him and is about to kill him but then Rachel shows up and shoots Leon. BTW Leon was the Replicant shown in the first scene of the movie. Wow that should be so mind blowing, except it's not because there was nothing interesting about 1. that interview or 2. this scene in particular. Forgot to mention Rachel came earlier to Deckard's appartment and then left. I also forgot to mention that before Leon found Deckard he was with Roy, the so called leader of this group of Replicants and tried to find out who could improve them and make them last. BTW their life span was only 4 years. Then Deckard takes Rachel home and forces her to love him and make out with him. And although this romance seemed forced I gotta say the two actors have chemistry together and therefore their relationship was the most interesting and captivating thing in this movie. Then Roy's girlfriend and the last Replicator finds JF Sebastian who was just a tool to get to Tyrell. Sebastian was basically a Tyrell\nwanna-be and was just as interesting as the movie itself for me. So Roy gets to Tyrell and kills him for being disappointed that he could not prolong his life to more than 4 years. Oh, he also kills Sebastian. So now somehow Deckard knows where JF Sebastian lived and finds there Roy's girlfriend and kills her so Roy gets mad, starts acting weird like unclothing himself taunting Deckard, piercing his hand with a nail and then at the end when Deckard is danger of falling down and dying he saves him, monologues and then dies. Wait a minute! Weren't the Replicants' lifespan 4 years? At the beginning we are told it was November 2019 and Roy was made in 2016 so he should last 'till 2020 right? Wrong! After he monologues he tilts his head down and dies. Like why? What killed him? His monologue? Then Deckard picks up Rachel and escapes somewhere where he and she could never be found. And that's it that's the pot of Blade Runner.End of Plot breakdown.What a complete mess of a movie. These are tow hours (or better said 4 hours) of my life I'll never get back. There are so many problems with this movie. From the ugly and unfuturistic setting of the movie to the fact that every single moment of this movie happens either during the night or during a night with rain. Like why? Why is there no daylight? Is that because of the industry of the world and how that is poluting and thus the sun couldn't shine? I mean it's looks nice but after a while it gets really boring and repetitive. The future is so ugly and I don't have a problem with a future where everything seems rotten or old, but this seems just like an 80's world with flying cars and big buildings. There is nothing in the realm of technology that looks even remotely similar to what those things look like in 2019/2020. It's just very unbelievable and not actually authentic and interesting. But that's a prblem most of the pre 2000 sci-fi movies have and that they show a very unfuturistic world. Not to mention the amatuerish editing that jumps from the scene presenting the replicants to something else instead of showing us after that the replicants in order for us to get familiarized with them and know why when some of them die, that is important for the plot. No, the movie jumps to something completely different so then when it jumps back on the first watch at least, is very confusing to know who is who and get involved into it.All in all this movie is a mess and one of the most overrated movies of all time, having no philosofical themes or moral questions about what's like to be human, boring characters, uninteresting script and boring plot.

I cannot fathom the level of foresight the screenplay, cinematography and direction required to make this movie back in 1982. Throughout the movie, you're treated to awesome displays of graphics, costume and dystopian vibes. I'm positively sure that Blade Runner gave birth to the cyberpunk era and has been the foundation for so many dystopian movies that have emerged since then. Harrison Ford, as always did a commendable job.What I didn't like - Blade Runner is a movie where the quality of the plot is neglected because everything else is so good. In my opinion, the plot is shallow and not that exciting. The movie is slow and takes it time to build up and the payoff at the end is not what you would expect.In a nutshell, Blade Runner is a visual spectacle without much substance.

Almost all of the film is a night show: crowds of people come and go in the rain, showing the end of the city with the background music.One of the reasons why this movie is famous is because of its unique theme and style, so that it was too advanced in that era and was considered \"bad film\".

They had more power and wisdom than humans. They were sent by humans to the universe to survey new homes. It makes no sense. So they want to resist. In fact, the artificial people in the movie are just like the human beings just born, seeing the beauty of the world, and embarking on endless exploration. Nowadays, mankind has become the \"God\" of man-made man, but he is not as kind as the God who created mankind. Mankind has always carried the arrogance of the Creator. Man-made humans have done too much work for humans from birth to death, but humans have not stopped their oppression. In the human world view, man-made humans are slaves.

Indeed if we consider the time when it came out (1982), the work done is remarkable and the instances where you think: \"this has aged badly\" are like two or three and it's pretty impressive. But it wasn't for me. Even with the plot I had some problems but I liked a lot other things. The story is simple and linear and there wasn't an unexpected moment but it's instead prevedibile in a lot of ways. On the other hand I was on board because of the charismatic protagonist and the memorable villain, that steals the show every time he is on the screen. But most importantly what I liked more is the mysterious sense about some plot points. In fact, despite a linear story, there are some elements here and there that makes you wonder about the real nature of some characters and the film does not answer to these questions. And I personally like when a movie leaves you with some thinking about what's the right interpretation even if there's no a clear one.\nAnd so overall I liked \"Blade Runner\" (the final cut) but, even if I recognised the enormous importance it has on the history of cinema, I don't think it's the masterpiece a lot of people claims this movie to be.", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 4}, "heading": "I will trigger the hardcore fans", "date": "2020-02-12T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5478725"}, {"content": "I thought this was a pretty good 80s movie.

I just saw it again for the first time in many years, and I still don't like it. I know a lot of people live this movie due to it's lush and highly-detailed staging. However, I don't like it for exactly that reason. Ridley Scott put all his effort into set decoration and staging, and absolutely no effort whatsoever into story or character development.\"Blade Runner\" takes place in a future (for 1982) Los Angeles where it rains ALL THE TIME, where it is always night and never day and where, for reasons that are never explained, nobody ever turns on a light switch. The only lights at all are generated by garish, flashing advertisements that, for reasons that are never explained, nobody ever shuts out by drawing the curtains. If I lived in such a place I would draw my curtains and switch on my lights but, as I say, in the Los Angeles of the future, it seemingly never occurs to anybody to do that.The plot, where there is of it, revolves around a policeman whose job is to kill cyborgs who are supposed to live only \"off-world\" when they escape and return to Earth. However, unlike every other policeman I have ever heard of, he is expected to carry out his duties alone, without any back-up, and completely unsupported. There is one police character who dogs his tracks but, for reasons that are never explained (a lot in Blade Runner is never explained) he seems to constitute more of a nuisance than a help. In fact, he seems to have been assigned solely to keep tabs on the main character, rather than to aid him in any way.The cyborgs have several opportunities to kill the main character which, for reasons that are never explained, they each bungle clumsily. These cyborgs, who are supposedly super-human, super-strong killers, simply can't seem to bring themselves to kill this guy. Mostly they fail because they are too busy showing off to kill him. However, I suppose that, if they simply killed him, there would be no movie.Blade Runner might have made a good 1/2-hour \"Twilight Zone\", or 1-hour \"Outer Limits\" episode. However, it simply doesn't have enough substance for a full-length motion picture.

Deckard is tasked with bringing down four Replicants to do so he must follow a trail of almost impossible bread crumbs that will lead him to his targets before they can track down the one person that can extend their lifespan and make them whole their father and creator who designed them.The amazing cinematography in this movie is mind blowing and really does stand out with it's unique and cool Noir style and with Harrison Ford as the badass and cool futuristic detective Deckard this movie is a unique and visually stylish science fiction masterpeice that tells a unique and interesting story that takes it's time building suspence that leads up to an amazing third act where the hunter becomes the hunted.The supporting cast and Co star's do an amazing job and includes Daryl Hannah as the beautiful looking but deadly replicant (Pris) and Rutgar Hauer as the lead replicant (Roy Batty) who only wants one thing to extend his life and be a free replicant and will go to any lengths to make that happen.If you haven't seen this science fiction masterpeice I urge you to give it a watch it took me over 20 years to finally watch it and I wish I had watched it sooner as it is now one of my favourite science fiction movies.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Science Fiction Noir", "date": "2020-02-02T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5454288"}, {"content": "I am not entirely sure how it has taken me all my life until this point in time to finally watch Blade Runner.

He plays a very different character who is more flawed so more human and relatable. Harrison Ford is simply perfect in this role.Sean Young who plays Rachael is simply fantastic. She is one of my favourite female side characters in film. She is a beautiful yet tragic character who you just feel for emotionally the most in the entire film.Rutger Hauer who plays Roy Batty is simply the shinning Actor of the film and the most underrated character in cinema easily and so is Rutger Hauer who is simply does one of the best and moving movie performances ever. Rutger also wrote the iconic lines for the most iconic scene in the film \"Tears in Rain\" which is fantasticly written by Rutger and Ridley. He is the best character in this movie. And the clear character standout who isnt talked about enough.\nRIP Rutger Hauer Thank You!!This film has the best soundtrack I've ever heard in the film quite possibly and that's almost impossible to decide but this ones definitely up there.

I am a big fan of Syd Mead, who developed a lot of the futuristic objects and street designs for the film. Personally, I am mostly interested in production design (Ridley Scott was a production designer himself and it shows in this opulent, visually strong film) and am intrigued on how the film resembles social, ethnical and political aspects into buildings, textures, light and sceneries.It's hard to overstate how influential the film was; it invented the sci-fi sub genre now known as \"cyberpunk\", and it was also the first \"film noir\" in a sci-fi setting. I was stunned by the creative approach onto the noir 'look' (and 'cliches' sometimes) and how the film builds onto them to generate a new approach.Personally, I am a fan of the slower paced storytelling and the fact that there is not so much action / violence shown in the film compared to works today. (I could see myself drifting off in the last part of the film where a lot of fighting goes on...).The story is deeply philosophical and still prominent in today's connection with technology. Sky Mead said: \"Technology builds onto itself - we extend, perfect, re-invent older forms of technology. We reassemble it to form new ways of creation and interaction.\" Sure, the film depicts another 2019 than we live in, superficially, but the sub-message of the film stays the same: the (in the 80s) modern technologies and media (television, radio, screens, telephones,...) are reassembled to futuristic machines. Today, we work with highly perfected machines like smartphones and small computers, that were originated in the past.Blade runners approach onto the city-scape in general features a dark consumer-driven dystopia, mixed with dirt, cramped spaces (many people), nights lit by billboards, shop fronts and social services and surveillanced by oversized advertising hover-aircrafts shouting messages onto society. The set design features many textures and crafted elements from the far east, different religions (globalization?), even some buildings represent ancient maya temples - the city became the world.I love watching films from that point of view and am happy I finally got to see a groundbreaking film that influenced pop culture, modern sci-fi and is referenced throughout film making history until today.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Timeless futuristic eye-candy with deep, philosophical content.", "date": "2019-12-02T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5295389"}, {"content": "The athmosphere, created by Blade Runner is like no other.

As for the date, well, since no day of the month is given, just November 2019, I guess you can\nsay that the movie takes place today, the 27th of November, at least I prefer it to.The good -\nThe special effects. Even today the special effects are astonishing. The sets are eye popping as well. The look of a future L.A., overpopulated, trashy, and being\nso clogged up with smog that its always nighttime dark 24/7 - only the tallest buildings can look over the smog and see sunlight - while raining most of the time because of the pollution, now this was a great idea. Even Philip K. Dick, who happened to see some dailies\nof Blade Runner before he passed on said the world that the movie set forth was very close to the one he imagined when he wrote \"Do Androids Dream of\nElectric Sheep\", the novel the movie is based upon. As for the music. Vangelis' moody score adds even more depth. Then there is Harrison Ford's performance as Rick Deckard. Ford is well cast. He really gives a level to the character I don't think anybody else could pull off. In fact everybody's performance is good - especially Rutger Hauer's. He gives one of the the most vile, yet sympathetic villain performance you will ever see.The bad -\nWell the story does kind of bog down a little. Is Deckard really a flesh and blood human, a tired old Blade Runner who hates his job and guzzles booze? Or is he a Replicant himself, recently programmed to think his existence is that of a tired old Blade Runner who hates his job and guzzles booze? The war between Scott and Ford on this subject is legendary and one of the main reasons the two did not get along. Scott said Deckard was a Replicant and left subtle clues\nabout it. Ford said the opposite and did the same as Scott to get his point across as well. This is what throws the movie off a bit. Is he one of them... yes or no? Well you'll just have to decide that for yourself... and sometimes that kind of ideology is only limited to how much it works. Like here.\nAnother thing I will disagree with is the notion that Ford's narration is pointless, like Scott - and Ford as well - thought (they were forced by Warner Bros to put the narration in after preview audiences got confused on the narration-less storyline). It is why it is not in the Director's Cut, Scott removed it. But I feel it adds greatly to the atmosphere in Blade Runner, not takes away. And as a result the movie looses some of it's impact without it. The same goes for the original \"happy\" theatrical ending, which got the same treatment as the narration. The ending adds to the feel, not takes away. All of this is why I prefer the original Theatrical Cut over any other.The great -\nRutger Hauer's soliloquy at the end. No spoilers here as everybody has heard about this thing. Hell, it is even on the movie's soundtrack!. But when I saw Blade Runner back in 1982 (yes, I actually saw it in the\nmovie theater when it was released back then!) the soliloquy was not that well known at the time and it came out of left field for me. It made my\njaw drop! To me it sums up what the feel of the film is about, and that is being alive and existing. It is brief, poetic, and beautifully spoken by Hauer. I guarantee you, from the time you hear it, it will haunt you from that moment on.Even now this movie STILL demands your attention. Forget those who says the special effects and the fantastic sets are the movie's stars and not Ford, Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Brion James, or anybody else.

Other than that, it was just filled with errors and cliches.Tyrell Corporation certainly must have the records/profiles of the replicants they have produced (it is a much bigger plot hole if they don't, as they are the biggest company on Earth). Records which include their names, faces etc. Bryant seems to have those files, as he mentions it to Deckard, knowing even their production purposes (Leon being the ''ammunition loader on intergalactic runs'', Pris being the pleasure bot, etc.). They could have just utilized them, there would be no need for the Voight-Kampff test at all.We have a world which classic sci-fi stuff like off-world colonies, flying cars and surprisingly ''intergalactic'' travel exists, yet people don't have air conditioners so use cheap ventilators in their offices. This may seem like a small problem with creativity, but there is something bigger:Intergalactic means between galaxies, closest galaxy to ours is Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy, which is 25,000 light years from our Solar System (so even if you move at the speed of light, it would take 25,000 years to reach there). In order to reach CMDG, you must either have space ships traveling way faster than the speed of light or some technology to warp the space-time (a kind of a cosmic shortcut). No matter which one they have, a society that is advanced enough to travel between galaxies would not be in a poor situation such as the one depicted in Blade Runner.Replicants, humanoid robots who are able to feel emotion and they live only four years but we don't get even a fictional explanation of how. To have emotions, their neurological structure must be extremely similar to humans, but then you cannot implement any memories. Deckard is a former blade runner and he was the best of them, according to Bryant. Yet, he seems very surprised when he sees the profile of a replicant on the computer screen, he even feels the need to ask ''What's this?'' (at least he could wait for two seconds until Bryant explains it, right?)City is presented as a large and overpopulated urban area, so the police force must be equally large in order to preserve order. But when one blade runner gets injured, they pull a former one out of retirement. This indicates that police force is critically insufficient.One of the replicants, Leon, is said to be able to lift ''400-pound atomic loads'' but when he confronts our tough cop he decides to pass the time with soft slapping him around instead of just finishing him (so Rachel can show up just in time and save Deckard & they can have romantic moments...)It is also very interesting that Rachael doesn't know that she is a replicant, despite these robots have superhuman strength and agility. Have she never tried to lift something heavy or catch something quickly in her life before? If you're going to say that she wasn't designed for missions requiring physical strength, explain me this: why does Pris, a replicant designed for ''pleasure'', has super strength/agility (enough to defeat Deckard, an experienced blade runner, in unarmed combat)?Why does Sebastian, a genetic engineer for the biggest company in the world, live in a jerry-built apartment out of electricity? I see no reason for the lights being out all the time in the movie, other than the desperation to make the atmosphere ''darker''.Tyrell is wanted by his creations (they killed 20 people and coming after him) so he is supposed to be cautious about his security but somehow there is nothing in the name of security around where he lives (not even a camera in the elevator) and Roy easily gets to his bedroom (Tyrell never panics, presses any emergency button or calls for help by the way) and gouges his eyes, because Tyrell acts like this creature who he limited his life span to four years is his best friend in the world.Roy can break bricks with his head but screams in pain when he pierces his hand with a nail...Question that how does Roy know Deckard's name is still unanswered.Only reason that Roy's death was brought two months forward was to have a dramatic ending.All right. I don't mean to offend anyone who is a fan of this film, in fact I think Blade Runner could be awesome. I kind of still like it with its flaws. However, I cannot just ignore everything, jump on the fan vagon and claim this is a ''masterpiece''. For me, this is no different than a B-movie you would only watch to have some fun. I know I only pointed out the negative aspects but that's because of the intense hype this film gets.

Then went to see it performed with a live soundtrack at the Royal Albert Hall. The show and performance was immense. Anyway back to the movie, great plot, great cast, great special effects. Has not really dated at all. The version I saw was the directors cut, which does not feature Deckards voiceover, which is a shame as I really like that and feel it adds something more to the movie. The one thing I really realised this time round was that it was difficult to identify who the heroes and victims really were in this. I always obviously rooted for Deckard but his profession is not that admirable really. The replicants actually care for each other and have feelings that few actual humans actually demonstrate in the movie. Yes the replicants are violent but at the same time they are only trying to survive. Providing them with feelings and emotions is cruel and then to ultimately end their life abruptly is a horrible way to go. They want answers, revenge, to live a decent life. They are treated like robots which essentially they are, but they have human feelings. You very much feel for them where as the humans, even Deckard at times are the aggressors and have very few redeeming features. The way Deckard seduces Rachael is actually quite rough.

Here, synthetic humans known as replicants are bio-engineered by the powerful Tyrell Corporation to work on off-world colonies. When a fugitive group of Nexus-6 replicants led by Roy Batty escapes back to Earth, burnt-out cop Rick Deckard reluctantly agrees to hunt them down.This was yet another film I had to watch for my Filmic Text class that I had never seen before. I know it's regarded as one of the \"greatest science-fiction films of all time\", but I'm going to argue that Ridley Scott's \"Alien\" is a far superior film. That's not to say \"Blade Runner\" was a bad film, it's not but I have my gripes with it. Let's start off with the positives though. The clear argument about humanity, more specifically what makes us human is very interesting to me. Also the replicants themselves have enough depth to them where they were interesting as well, and how it's determined if they are replicants is quite cool. The futuristic sets that mix futuristic los angeles and asian culture was a really stellar idea, though it's borders on racist at times. We really didn't need to cut to a geisha billboard throughout the film. Moving onto one of the negatives, the pacing. It felt dragged down at parts, without tension like shown in \"Alien\" this kind of pacing is felt amongst viewers.Rachael's character I could relate to the most, but seeing how important her character really is to the plot she should've been present more. Also the argument of \"that scene\" between Deckard and Rachael in his apartment is not justified because of the year this was made. It's ironic how a film like this could have a scene like that that's supposed to be set in 2019 whereas its that year now and that would not fly in the slightest nowadays! It's way too sexual assaulty for me to be comfortable watching it, when clearly it's intended to be \"romantic\" by the choice of jazz music and lighting. This is the one scene that I agreed with my class that felt completely out of place and against Deckard's character thus far.No I have not seen all versions of the film and I'm not going to. It's a little asinine to me when people claim that you \"have to watch all versions\" in order to grasp the full concept of the film. No I'm pretty sure I got the idea from whatever version I saw, its Harrison Ford running around being Harrison Ford. With cool visuals and relevant concept, even more so in current day than when it was released.

One commonality I have had with my viewings of this film is that I ALWAYS aim to watch them in the nighttime, preferable between 10pm-12am where everyone but me is asleep.I recommend you to do the same. It is unreal, if the film hasn't numbed you with how lonely our existence is, these viewing requirements should enhance the experience. This film is absolutely beautiful for its time, the cinematography, lighting and scores of Vangelis all combined can make the viewing experience orgasmic for many viewers. 24 hour nighttime days, constant rain, bustling side-stores, traffic congestions and a mass of people everywhere sporting dystopian fashion. Most of us probably have not found ourselves under these circumstances all at the same time, but the film does a great job of transporting us these on the streets of chaotic, bleak Los Angeles in 2019.The lovely thing about this film is that no matters how many times you view it, twice, thrice, ten times etc... There is always an idea, detail or theory you can formulate during or after the film. It rubs off you, not maybe the first time but the second time you will start to feel it. I definitely did not know what was going on the first time I viewed this film, sure the plot was simple and straightforward on paper, but the real fun comes from experiencing and observing the process and completing the plot.Some of us will \"get it\" in the first viewing, that is cool. Some of us will not \"get it\" in the first viewing, that is also cool. Blade Runner is a film to be patient with, the aim of the film is to show the depressing and hopeless paradox of a technologically dominated society. This idea is magnified by observing the small details: little to no natural flora and fauna makes for a total urbanised city with no goal but to make it little by little every single day, trash littered across the city, large masses of homeless people, lights constantly surveying the city scapes and streets and the buildings all providing light making up for the lack of clear skies.I can say right now that I still do not fully \"get it\", the film has characters commiting multiple actions with dual meanings which deserves another review for more explaining but I'd rather let you watch it for yourself to experience this pioneer of the sc-fi, dystopian neo-noir genre.It is a film that you should not compel yourself to watch, this film is not for everyone but do not hold yourself back if uncertain because it is worth it.

I could appreciate that if there was some great story telling going on. However it's not really clear what the hell is going on.Harrison Ford is just walking around looking confused.

I sat to watch it for the second time with intentional bias to see only positives but in the end the only positives I found was tone and technical details. Blade Runner, godfather of all that is cyberpunk, truly has that stagnant atmosphere of futuristic desolation essential to the genre. Sunless cityscape with a thousand points of meaningless lights, streets littered with nowhere people, isolation creeping behind the cynical antihero... memorable. Visual representation is great and groundbreaking for a 1982 year (I guess). It conveys the feeling and it is enough for me.But everything else, namely script and, as a consequence, actors play, is a drab. Blade Runner plot is weak and its direction is even weaker. The pursuit for escaped replicants does not to grab attention at any point of the movie. All the numerous scenes that try to emphasize the characters of the dystopia, bring mostly disillusionment because they are either pretentious, banal or out of place. The pinnacle example is the renown final scene where Roy chases Deckard for whole ten minutes all the while howling like foolish dog. Can you truly say that scene had to be there in a full length? That it had to be there at all? Aside from countless artificial attempts to display the depth of the personas or philosophy of the setting Blade Runner has almost nothing.

First time I saw this film, it was the original version when it came out in Belgium (where I grew up) in 1982. Decades later, I saw it again, this time on DVD and in the \"Director's Cut\" or \"Final Cut\", I can't quite remember. The version I saw today was definitely the Final Cut.\"Blade Runner\" (originally released in 1982; The FInal Cut released in 2007; 117 min.) brings the story of Deckard, as he tracks down 4 replicants who have escaped from an Off World and need to be \"retired\" with extreme prejudice. As the movie opens, we are reminded it is \"Los Angeles, November, 2019\". YES, this very year! In Ridley Scott's (bleak and dark) vision of the future, LA is in permanent darkness and rain, with lots of pollution, and lots of overcrowding. Our man Deckard (Harrison Ford) meets Rachel (Sean Young), who may or may not be a replicant, who can tell for sure? In the meantime Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) is the leader of the replicants and up to no good...While watching this in the theater today, I was struck by several things: first, the enormous vision from Ridley Scott this movie asked for (and received). Second, the set design and production is out of this world STILL, now almost 40 years later. Third, while there is very little \"action\", this movie flew by in no time (same as its Blade Runner 2049 sequel, incidentally). A movie like \"Blade Runner\" begs to be seen on the big screen. As luck would have, my art-house theater here in Cincinnati is doing a month-long sci-fi classics festival during July, and this was the first (and certainly not the last) that I was eager to see again in the theater. The July 4 matinee screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, and I imagine the later screenings will be PACKED.

Dick was probably the most Wildly imaginative & enigmatically-Creative (some might aptly say 'warped' - but in the absolute Best sense of that word of course) Science Fiction/ Speculative Fiction writer ever to grace our humble little Planet Earth! And Ridley Scott is one of the finest Cinematic Artists around (i.e. truly bringing to vital & vibrant artistic 'Life' those elusive but fascinating pictures-words/ sights & sounds!)Put these two uniquely exemplary Artists together and you get an authentically superlative (and even mind-blowing) result like the original 'Blade Runner' (first released circa 1982 - but still more than slightly ahead of our Time, circa2019!)Blade Runner's reputation has been significantly enhanced in the years after its initial Box office run in 1982 - initially, audiences were probably expecting (from a SciFi film with a futuristic setting) either the exhilarating sense of wonderment of Star Wars or forward-looking optimism inherent to Star Trek - or perhaps the futuristic terror of 'Alien' but instead they got a complex/multi-faceted and 'realistic' scenario of a possible near-future full of moral ambiguities = presenting many more questions than answers, and a genuinely 'uneasy' feeling about possible things to come (i.e. perhaps not the bright future we were all hoping for?)But that uneasy/ tenuous atmosphere is exactly where this film generates its real power = this is based on Philip K. Dick after all, and his futures are filled with paranoid (or at least uncertain-enigmatic/ constantly shape-shifting) visions in which things are almost always Not what they first appear to be - and where concepts like 'good & evil' and even our individual identities become irrelevant or interchangeable.Ridley Scott perfectly conceptualizes the Dystopian ambiguity inherent to P.K.Dick - and considerably broadens the visual Scope of the original source-book 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' ==> by spectacularly re-imagining/ updating Fritz Lang's 'Metropolis' inspired City-scapes, although in much darker shades (and even enhancing said scenery with more than a bit of spectacular Japanese-Asian flair & futuristically eye-popping aesthetics!)In any event, Blade Runner does what Speculative Fiction has always done Best = force us to think about our possible futures and contemplate the true meaning of 'identity' 'empathy' and even 'humanity' = not bad for a Movie classified in the humble little 'genre' of futuristic film noir.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "'Blade Runner' = Dystopian Future at its most Picturesque and Prescient?", "date": "2019-06-30T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4967462"}, {"content": "I remember my first viewing of 1982's Blade Runner. From the director of Alien, the guy who starred in Star Wars and Raiders of the Lost Ark, and a science fiction setting that was marketed as some sort of sci-fi adventure in the vein of Star Wars, this couldn't go wrong, right? My young teenage self was in for utter disappointment. I did not expect a deep, thoughtful movie that explores what it means to be human. With hardly any action scenes, I was pretty disappointed. More than ten years later, I gave the film a chance with a more mature pair of eyes. I certainly was able to appreciate the wonders of the movie a lot more. This is one of those films that is always misunderstood at first, but people come back to appreciate it later on. Like this one particular viewer!Ridley Scott, coming off his highly successful horror sci-fi Alien wanted to direct something with more meaning and lyrical, so he was given Hampton Fancher's script to read. Based on Philip K. Dick's story, \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,\" the script tackles some dark themes and it ask questions like, \"should we value humans without emotions or androids with emotion?\" The movie and the script borrows themes from classic Greek literature and from the Bible itself. Even with a narrow teenage mind, I was impressed at the overt religious overtone the film had. This film meant much to Scott because he wanted to tackle this kind of project after the death of his older brother. He did have to combat his producers and the studio over this project. For example, he was forced to add mediocre narration that took away from the story. Luckily, he took out that narration in the Director's Cut, released many years later.It is the year 2019, in the futuristic city of Los Angeles. (I really love how the movie portrayed the year we are currently in). The race of man was able to create technology that allowed them to make humanoids with short, fixed lifespans called replicants. These replicants were banned from Earth and sent to off-world colonies. The main character of the story, Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a Blade Runner. A Blade Runner is a cop whose specialization is to hunt down any escaped replicants. When four replicants led by Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) makes their way to Earth, Deckard has to hunt them down while truly discovering who he is himself.I thought the performances were very good. Harrison Ford also wanted to have a deeper, symbolic role and he was intrigued by the questions this film asked. He gave a meaningful, but low-key performance. It's a shame that he often clashed with Ridley Scott on set, but these two did not get along. Rutger Hauer delivered the film's best performance. With his striking blond hair and eyes, no one can forget his villainous performance that goes down in the history books as one of the best. I also liked Sean Young's performance as the replicant Rachael who believes that she is human. Keep an eye out for other great supporting performances from Edward James Olmos, M. Emmett Walsh, and Daryl Hannah.I was blown away with the futuristic design and the special effects. The look of the film was created by Douglas Trumbull, the same man who worked on the effects for 2001: A Space Odyssey. There is also a nice use of product placement in the film, which is the most memorable in my mind. Such advertisements from Coca-Cola and Atari were used. Fun fact! The sales of these companies dropped after appearing in the film, later known as the \"Blade Runner Curse.\" Some designs that stood out to me, excluding the whole futuristic look, were the cop cars known as spinners and a lie detector test known as the Voight-Kampff Machine. Philip K. Dick passed away before the film began production, but he was pleased at the look of the film. The visions he saw matched the visions of his brain.Another important part of the movie is the music. Coming off his Academy Award win for his famous score for 1981's Chariots of Fire, he creates an atmospheric synth-based score. The atmospheric music complements the film very well, and who can forget the tenor sax love theme. If anything is wrong with the movie, it is definitely not the music!Many film buffs call Blade Runner one of the best science-fiction films of all time. In my own humble opinion, it is definitely one of the most important films to the genre, but maybe there have been better movies, quality-wise. That said, this is still a very good film. My biggest issue is the pacing and the off-hand narration, but Ridley Scott directs this film like an expert. It is a character-driven, theme-based movie that asks many important questions. I do like how they leave many of these questions ambiguous. Of course, the biggest question of all: Is Rick Deckard a replicant?My Grade: B+", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 3}, "heading": "A Visual Treat For Your Senses!", "date": "2019-06-29T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4965074"}, {"content": "I despise how the Final Cut is worshiped, because it seemed that the couple didn't make it out of L.A. alive, and there is no cheery voiceover about what happened, as if Ridley Scott INTENDED to make this a tragedy.

The feelings it evokes are so strong, that at times it is almost overwhelming to watch. Based on the rather well known novel by Philip K. Dick \"Do Androids dream of Electric Sheep?\", it borrows from the futuristic, dystopian universe of the novel but, being a movie, it surpasses it and becomes something greater, something more profound, something that no movie has been able to top since. It is no coincidence that all the futuristic movies/series since then, have borrowed very heavily from Blade Runner in aesthetics, environments, music and so on. The irony is that even today, with all the CGI available, BR instead of being outdated, still shines to the point you would think it was filmed last year not almost 40 yrs ago. Even if Ridley Scott didn't make any other movie before or after BR, I would still regard him as one of the best directors ever, just for this film. The blending of the cinematography, music, acting and script give us the definitive cyberpunk movie, which is deeply philosophical in its core, and where most dystopian films try and fail to deliver, BR is successful and ominous at the same time. The soundtrack by the great Vangelis Papathanasiou is nothing short of a masterpiece- there are times that I think Vangelis might not even be a human, but an advanced alien in disguise because the music he writes is just otherwordly. Combine his music with the visuals created by Scott and his team, and you get a pretty detailed picture of what the future is very likely to look like- foggy and dirty, acidic and ultra high tech, familiar and strange at the same time. It is a world where nothing is as it seems, the humans act like replicants and the replicants like humans. The lines are blurred and upon a second viewing, you literally don't know who to root for. I will stop here- there are so many things to praise about this film that it is impossible to do so here. If you haven't watched it, please do so.

It was directed by Ridley Scott, and major actors in the film were Harrison Ford, Sean Young, and Rutger Hauer. The story itself is based on the short story \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" by Philip K. Dick, and Hampton Fancher and David Webb Peoples wrote the screenplay. The soundtrack was written by Vangelis. The film is a sci-fi/noir detective film. The film is rated R, and compared to other more modern R-rated films, Blade Runner is one of the milder R-rated movies. Many consider Blade Runner to be a classic, and there are several elements in the film that support this feeling. Though Blade Runner is approximately 36 or 37 years old, readers who want to avoid spoilers, pay attention: This review will have spoilers, but warnings will be given beforehand. The section with spoilers will be marked by the following: *-*-*-*-*The basic plot of the movie is that in the 21st Century, Tyrell Corporation has advanced robotics to the Nexus era, during which Replicants were created. Replicants are essentially cyborgs that are almost identical to humans, and the Nexus 6 model of Replicants were designed to be better than humans in every aspect except one-- due to fear of them overpowering their creators, they were programmed to have a four-year lifespan. Replicants were used for slave labor in off-world colonies until they were declared illegal on Earth after a Nexus 6 combat team murdered people and escaped. Several task forces were formed to eliminate any Replicants who escaped to Earth; these task forces were called Blade Runner Units (hence the title of the film). The main character, a man named Rick Deckard is a member of such a unit who is called into duty (against his will) to hunt down and kill the four remaining members of the earlier-mentioned Nexus 6 combat team who escaped to Earth. The setting is stylized-- Los Angeles in a futuristic 2019 -- and the storyline is told in a linear fashion.The soundtrack is a major part of the movie. The film uses the soundtrack, characterization, editing, lighting, and camera movement to inspire feelings of calm or dread in order to truly heighten the experience. As most of the film happens in heavy shadow, the few locations that are lit have symbolic meaning; these locations are Tyrell Corporation (which is almost constantly illuminated by sunlight or electrically, and the architecture of the building itself is reminiscent of a Mesoamerican pyramid), and, though less frequently, Deckard's apartment. Cuts were used to establish a rhythm, to shift between characters (Deckard and the Nexus 6s), to transition between different areas, and to mark the passage of time. Specific camera movements and angles are used to direct the viewer's attention to certain things in each scene (objects in the environment that aid character development, etc.). Different languages are used (one character only speaks in English once), and unspoken words are often fairly easy to interpret. Suspension of disbelief is maintained fairly well throughout the movie, and this is broken only by a) the fact that it is now 2019, and the filmmakers gave people too much credit on how technologically advanced society would be now (similarly to Back to the Future), and b) it is raining in Los Angeles in almost every shot, and though this is to maintain the atmosphere of a noir film, it almost never actually rains in Los Angeles.\n*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*\nThere were only two things I personally didn't like about Blade Runner. One was the fact that the relationship between Deckard and Rachael was forced. I'm aware that this was most likely to fill the troupe of \"good guy gets the girl,\" but Deckard clearly forced himself onto Rachael. The romance subplot had a purpose, it was just rushed and didn't have much basis behind it. The second was how needlessly drawn out Tyrell's death scene was. I know this was probably to show off the special effects they had developed, and death scenes are usually exaggerated (especially in R-rated films), but it really didn't need to be that drawn out. Besides, Roy crushing Tyrell's skull and then proceeding to gouge his eyeballs out was a bit much.The fact that Gaff could suddenly speak fluent English at the end when he never bothered to before was a bit confusing, but I suppose Gaff just didn't feel like it until then.Also, the only things that gave Blade Runner an R rating were the gore that occured in the death scenes/fight scene at the end, and the fact that one of the Nexus 6s (Zhora) had her \"titties\" out on screen for about 20 seconds while getting dressed.\n*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*Overall, if you're a fan of sci-fi/noir detective films, Harrison Ford, or Ridley Scott, then you should check out Blade Runner and see what you think.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "An In-depth Description and Review", "date": "2019-05-06T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4832524"}, {"content": "The characters all use certain slang and language, that is because some of the characters are not human and have to develop feelings and things, while some are already human and talk in a way that they could carry on a not\nAl conversation , while you have deckard who is not human but he thinks he is and speaks like a human.The style was very interesting and set different moods for this move it seems to remain in a kinda dark tone so deftly has some creative people working in this movie with the dark raing scenes and you could always feel like you could cut the tension on the scenes with that feeling of stress between two people.\nThe camera angles give a point of view of how they feel and how they are acting, it also helps with a lot of the special effects.

This movie seems very driven in one direction never truly deviating from the path set in the very beginning too much. The beginning scene starts with a man being interrogated and they are zoomed in on his eyes as this takes place this sets the tone for what the world has in store for you. This is followed but a superhuman display even furthering the point that this is a sci-fi world. With later world building you can find some of the story grounded in reality that would remind the viewer of the world that we live in. There are other references to the our society with what is essentially the police in this movie. They for the most part enlisted Harrison Ford as a hit man that is to take out the replicants in the movie. These replicants possess superhuman strength and have a lifespan of 4 years. The only true way to tell the difference is through a series of questions that is testing their memories because they can only remember back so far due to the fact that they have implanted memories. He is tasked with finding all the remaining replicants in the world and eliminating them entirely. Along the way after taking out a few replicants he meets one that for some reason he finds different from the other and decides not to kill her after she saves him from a very near death situation. During this time they have a conversation that strongly foreshadows a very important plot twist towards the end of the of the movie. He then proceed to give him a lesson in humanity and how things are done by invoking humans natural instincts for reproduction within the human race. The very end of the movie throws one of the biggest plot twist when it is reveals that he is one of the replicants that he has been hunting the entire time. The movie leaves you with many question and a desire for a follow-up story on what happens to them if they are hunted like he stated that would happen in the movie.

However, this movie had definitely enlightened me to try to watch more older films. I love dystopian genre of movies and books. Blade Runner was a very original and different and nothing I had ever seen in this modern day. The beginning was definitely a bit confusing. Two men in a room, one asking the other one odd questions and then ends up fighting each other in the end. Watching this movie in our AP Literature class, no one around me really understood what was going on which had driven away the attention of most students in the room.\nAs the movie was going on, our teacher had told us that some of the setting was actually used with models none being CG. Being able to portray flying cars and things that won't even be invented till decades after the movie release was surprising. The movie made very realistic models which is crazy that they even did it without the help of computer graphics.\nThe ways that the characters were conveyed were very interesting. The replicants were often wearing clothes that most wouldn't have worn to fit into society. One of the female replicants had even put a black eyeshadow all over her eyes to make her look like a raccoon. The directors had used this to portray her more crazy like nature. While her lover was wearing what you would typically see villains from superhero movies wear. This was probably to show his strength and power as a replicant.\nThe theme of the movie was definitely that no matter what you try to create, humans can not be replicated perfectly to fit into society. They will either go crazy or just be insufficient compared to a actual human with feelings and a conscious to know right from wrong. Humans are pure and too complicated to convey in an artificial intelligence.\nThe movies message was to show how you should value your life and make the most of it. Replicants had only 4 years to live and were begging for more. While some people are throwing away their lives some people just want more of it.\nThe rating of this movie would be very different if it were to be rated today, with just mild language and little nudity.

The movie itself is critically famous for its impressive filmwork, which proves itself throughout the film. With the works of the directors, technology during that time, and the characters, a film in the 80s portrayed similar to a modern 21st century work.\nKnowing the movie was filmed in the 80s, where technology was not evolved to film such a work like Blade Runner, I was taken aback with parts of the movie. Due to the futuristic setting, there were flying cars, off the world colonies, and replicants. All the objects within the film were as realistic as possible, with help of lightning adjustment and organization. Often, the film is shown in the dark which adds to the rising mysteriousness aspect of Blade Runner. Light comes in as like from flashlights, just streaks going back and forth. It's similar to what one recognizes of prison and light falling through catching the criminal. Another impressive scene forwards toward the flying cars roaming around the futuristic setting of Los Angeles. Even in modern day, flying cars are way ahead of its time, so how did Blade Runner achieve its advance technology presentation without CGI ? Statues. By taking small objects and filming it close up over a long period accumulated a new insight in the filmmaking industry.\nThe movie's characters created a suspension of disbelief within the film with its concept of false, implanted memories. The replicants tease apart these memories between the realm of true and false. To be who you are, you have body and possessions, but what happens when they're all taken away; you're left with memories. But what if the last thing you have is also fake? When Deckard described Rachel's memories, they were not her own, but Tyrell's niece. Replicants have escaped from off world colonies and right there it portrays an alien-like world with beings other than humans. Violence with the death and fighting scenes between Deckard and the replicants, two scenes hold significant to the movie as a work overall. Deckard's chase after Zhora accordingly should've took less time than what was filmed, but the whole chase was put on slow motion creating a suspending moment. Zhora falls through multiple screens of glass showing detail along with the creeping music adding onto the climax where she's shot and falls to her death. Another scene is the ending between Deckard and Roy. The never ending rain and as previously said, the darkness and broken light rays by itself created a tension between the characters. Rutger Hauer portrayed Roy well, the inhumane movements, and ghastly sounds of a revengeful replicant.\nThis film was enjoyable to watch despite the time it was made in because it felt very ahead of its time, or perhaps the film defied time itself. It was confusing at certain points to understand more deeply on a futuristic level as it confused me with modern day beings. Blade Runner proved impressive with its filming technique for its realistic flying cars and ships. To imagine that it was all shot from a mini toy really surprises me, similar to the film The Nightmare Before Christmas.

The shot distances can make close up things seem much larger than they are such as cars and buildings they will have close up shots on smaller things to appear larger, the purpose they serve is due to budget and the fact that they can not use digital editing for things.\nThe purpose of the music in the film is too cause suspense and to make things more tense or more relaxed depending on the situation, when the music gets intense it makes u focus more and get on edge because you know something is about to happen that is going to be important,it helps to shape our interpretation by giving suspenseful music during an important part of the movie and helps you get a feel of the meaning of the the moment in that movie and helps to reinforce the scene.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 2}, "heading": "for ap lit", "date": "2019-05-06T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4832425"}, {"content": "As someone who grew up in the 2000s, I have not seen many movies that were made like Blade Runner. Blade Runner did a lot of great things with special effects that you would not expect a movie from 1982 be able to do with the lack of computer programs to assist them. For the most part the special effects were fairly believable, even now in 2019. The people who made the movie did a really good job making the movie believable for the most part, but there are some aspects of the movie that I find hard to believe.The movie takes place in Los Angeles in 2019, and in a very dark and rainy world. I do not recall seeing any sunlight throughout the entirety of the movie, which played a big role in setting the mood of the movie as a very down and emotionless time. The emotionless mood that I get from the rainy weather and lack of sunlight ties well into the emotionless state that the replicants live in with a lack of memory and a struggle to handle emotions. The Los Angeles that was depicted in 2019, is vastly different than current day Los Angeles supposedly set at the same time. The Los Angeles depicted in the movie is very congested with skyscrapers reaching high into the skies in every scene that shows the surroundings. The city in the movie was overcrowded with no nature or wildlife anywhere, the only life was the humans and replicants. Current day Los Angeles on the other hand has plenty of nature and wildlife. The actual city is not so overcrowded and polluted as the Los Angeles in the movie.The plot at times was difficult to understand and easy to get confused with while watching. Blade Runner is a movie that you should watch very closely or else you are going to get lost in the plot very quickly. There was times in the movie that I was confused who was who and what was currently happening in the movie, Blade Runner is definitely not a movie to throw on in the background while doing something else. I do not think it is the fault of the movie creators that the movie is confusing at times, rather it is the viewer not paying enough attention closely. It is partially the movie creators fault, but not as much as the audience is most likely at fault for not staying focused on the movie.Overall I thought the movie was enjoyable and everyone should give it a watch. It was different from any movie I've seen before, most likely due to the time I grew up. It has great special effects for its time.

It is a science fiction film based in the future, where a war against mankind and superficial humanoids is taking place. These human like creatures are called replicants, and have nearly exact mannerisms to a human, however, they feel no emotion. The only way to differentiate a replicant from a human was to run a test consisting of multiple questions aimed to revoke emotion and monitor them with a device that measures pupil dilation, capillary refill, and other physical signs to show emotion. If no emotion is sensed they are killed, or retired. In this movie four replicants stole a spaceship and are on a quest to find their creator. It is up to a retired blade runner to find them and retire them.\nThis movie is set on what the future was thought to look like in Los Angeles. It had very strong Japanese elements from clothing, store signs, billboards, and many languages were fused together to create one form of dialect. There were many futuristic forms of technology throughout the movie such as flying police cars. Characters did not have one style, rather every character had their own distinct way of dressing. Some characters such as the main character dressed fairly normal, while other characters wore heavy eye makeup and adorned themselves in unusual jewelry. The women in the advertisements displayed were dressed as geishas. The tone of this movie was a serious one and at times it was slightly violent. One of the opening scenes was a man doing a test on the replicant, and then the replicant shot and killed him when he could not answer questions about his mom. The main character throughout the movie narrates his thoughts. This reminded me of those black and white detective movies from the 60s. The setting and special effects of this movie are far ahead of other movies made in the 80s. The special effects are superb for its time, everything from the scene in a lab for replicant eyes to flying cars to the special effects makeup. If made today, however, with the technology and cgi we have today I personally believe more could be done in this movie, more creatures could be created to emphasis other planets have been discovered and colonized, the outfits could be given a Hunger Games Capital esque to them, and the violent scenes could have been made more realistic.\nIn conclusion, Blade Runner was an amazing film for its time. Everything from character development, to scene cuts, to setting and props, it is obvious a lot of effort and work was put into this film. This movie was rated R then but nowadays it would probably be PG13 due to today's society being less sensitized to nudity and violence. It was an excellent movie although hard to follow at times.

It was made to be set in 2019, and it being 2019 currently makes this movie appealing to look into. Even though this movie did not accurately predict what present day society would be like, the movie did an amazing job of portraying a futuristic society. From immense skyscrapers to flying cars to replicants of people, the audience is made to believe this alternate universe will exist in the future regardless of when this future may be. This movie largely focuses on this in depth future and details of the society and less on conflict between characters. The movie does not have as much action as I was expecting considering that Harrison Ford's, Deckard's, mission was to eliminate the existing replicants on Earth. Personally, I thought the build up to conflict between characters was slow because of the large focus on setting the mood for the film and society. The setting of this movie was gloomy and mysterious. This is set through the constant rain and dim lighting in the film. Since most of the movie is dark and in the shadows, the points of the movie that are illuminated show their importance in regards to a visual appeal. I also feel like the characters add to the mood of the movie in a beneficial way. Deckard's mindset and personality in the movie is very bland which may stem from the idea presented at the end of the movie. Other characters like Tyrell also seem very emotionless in the film. His role as an intellectual and designer of the replicants is accurately portrayed through his bland emotion. Another way the tone is set in the movie is through the soundtrack. The majority of the music in the film contains a saxophone and does a very good job at portraying mystery along with showing the goal of Deckard trying to complete his mission. This music combined with the characters as well as the tone portrayed through the setting contribute to the gloomy society that is meant to be depicted.

However, the following statements are my honest opinions. In this of Blade Runner review, I will be discussing three different topics: aesthetics, costuming, and setting.\nThroughout the entire movie, one thing that really stood out to me was the overall aesthetics of the film. Everything is dark. Most of the lighting is dark and heavily plays on shadows. The weather is also gloomy, and the presence of rain further darkens most scenes. The entire movie is colored by shades of black and gray. For example, in the scenes where Rick is walking through streets, most of the buildings are gray, and they loom over the people walking below them. Rick's apartment also competes for the title of darkest setting in the movie. The walls are painted gray, and the corners are dark enough to conceal a person. However, the gloomiest, darkest, grayest (if that's a word), most depressing scene is the rooftop fight scene, where Roy speaks his last words. The message delivered here, that memories will eventually fade, is just as dark as the aesthetics. The lighting and scenery accompanies the darkness of the theme of Blade Runner.\nThe people of Blade Runner are dressed mostly in black, allowing characters to retreat into shadows. The black attire is so uniform, that I almost feel like there's a rule that outlaws colorful clothes or that all characters are stuck in their middle school emo phases. Although, I do understand how the dark clothes help push the theme and aesthetics of the movie. I do like how the main fashion trend is sort of a 1940's rich white woman meets a 1990's leather jacket wearing teenager. The costumes help draw attention to the importance of the characters in the movie. Rachel's dress is exactly that- her dress. The structure fits her perfectly and allows her to make a silent statement when she enters a scene. Rick wears a long leather coat that adds drama to action scenes.\nLastly, I wanted to compare the setting of Blade Runner with today. The movie is set in 2019, and is it currently 2019... This is kind of like the whole Back to the Future comparison. Obviously, the writers and producers didn't see 2019 being that dark and uniform, but the robot aspect might have been expected. The film came out in 1982, so the prediction of creating some sort of robotic human within 40 years is reasonable. We do have bionic prosthetics and Hanson Robotic's Sophia, but our robotic development isn't as realistic as predicted in Blade Runner. They also have an underlying theme that in this version of the future, people aren't really individuals with a purpose. At this point, most people are just living because they're alive.

The cinematography for this film for when the film was made is insane. The sound and special effects for this film were shot extremely well.The music and sound are very crucial to this movie in my opinion. If you were to remove some of the music from certain scenes the whole scene would be ruined and would not make much sense. The soundtrack for this film is what makes this film flow so well. The music gives the movie a certain feeling in a way. The music was very electronic, slow paced, and just overall mysterious. It sort of set the mood for the film in a way. It kind of made think of smooth jazz. The dialogue and music fit insanely well together in my opinion, the film wouldn't make feel the same if you replaced the music that is in the film or took out the music all together. It just blends so well together. There is a particular scene in the film where there are bells and it sort of symbolizes or foreshadows something that is going to happen next in the movie and when that thing happens the sounds and visuals used make the scene that much better. It's just perfect in a way. If those bells weren't in that scene and the music and sounds weren't used in that scene it would not have made it that meaningful. It gave the scene so much meaning.

Especially for being done in the 1980s it is beyond what I would have hoped for. All the cars and landscapes in the film felt so realistic and natural in a way. It gave the film such a futuristic feel with the flying cars, not to mention that all of the visuals and special effects were done with props, models, and art. The amount of work that was put in to make this film so beautiful can be very much acknowledged by watching it.

The lighting for this film was extremely important as well too because it gave the movie that futuristic/mysterious feel to it as well. If some of these camera angles were shot any different than what they are it would throw some of the audience off and I feel as if they did a good job filming this movie.For as old as this movie is, it is probably one of the best movies when it comes to blending music and visuals together.

Not many films are able to establish such a profound and unique cinematic universe in a little more than two hours.

In the film, Detective Rick Deckard (played by Harrison Ford) is pulled out of retirement, and tasked with tracking down four Nexus 6 Replicants - robots with superhuman strength designed to be used as slave labor on hazardous planets - who have illegally landed on Earth after hijacking a spaceship and murdering everyone on board.The film is stylized like a film noir. The only main difference between the plot of a true film noir and Blade Runner is that Blade Runner is set in the distant future of 2019 (the distant future in 1981 anyway). Though, with the setting, there comes a number of dramatic turns that could only be accomplished in film of its kind. The movie's plot brings to mind questions about humanity through the allegory of the Voight-Kampf test - a device and procedure designed to tell man from machine. Though the test is only conducted twice in the entire film, there is certainly more to glean from it than whatever is on the surface level - especially after a character asks Deckard if he's ever done the test on himself before. The movie's ending leaves the viewer just as many questions as the beginning, which, in Blade Runner's case, is probably the best possible way to conclude. I personally believe that this movie is one of the few films which has a perfectly written story.While in my opinion the plot is the best aspect of the movie, the way the movie was filmed and constructed is just as, if not more important than any amount of writing.Every single shot has a purpose. There is not one camera angle, one brief snippet of film used, that isn't necessary. Anything that is visible on-screen is there for a reason, however cryptic it may be. Nothing is on-screen for longer than it needs to be either. The shots are cut in such a way that every featured object is on screen for just long enough for the viewer to both see it, and contemplate it and its relevance to the film. I retained more from my first viewing of Blade Runner than I have retained from consecutive viewings of most other movies. Right alongside the camerawork, the lighting is also fundamental to creating the atmosphere of the movie. Being a sort of \"neo film noir\", most of the movie is set in darkness. The weather is constantly dark and stormy. Most illumination is done via neon, street lights, and headlights. If anything is lit up, it's important. For example, when light is shone in a replicant's eyes, there is a strange reflective effect reminiscent of the eyes of a cat or dog. It creates a way for attentive viewers to keep track of who is and isn't a replicant, and in general is a very intriguing effect to behold. Conjunctly, this is one of a few movies where I noticed the lighting directly contributes to the mood of the story. For instance, during a tense, high-energy chase scene in the film, most of the lighting is done with rapidly rotating or otherwise mobile spotlights - usually associated with risk and danger. In this film in particular, light is so important that it can drastically change the mood of a scene whilst still maintaining relative subtlety.The casting in this movie is extremely fitting. I couldn't picture an actor other than Harrison Ford playing Deckard. It's just not possible in my mind. Aside from the main character, the way the replicants are portrayed in the film feels extremely fitting - given a major plot point in the movie is that replicants only have a four-year lifespan. They behave in what could be described as a child-like manner, putting feeling before thought into their actions. They don't have any past memories or maturity to go off of, so they'd naturally act like an upset child during the situations presented. The actors did a great job of conveying this, and I probably wouldn't have caught it if they didn't accentuate it.In conclusion: Blade Runner is unique. It's an art film that doesn't feel drawn out (as art films have a tendency to do) and is also extremely engaging. Despite being made in 1981, it still stands up today, and remains a timeless classic. 2019 may not be the futuristic landscape Ridley Scott pictured when he set the film, but being the current year, it's more relevant than ever to look at this classic piece of science fiction, and appreciate its worth - both as it was back then, and now.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 3}, "heading": "More Relevant Now Than Ever", "date": "2019-05-02T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4822240"}, {"content": "This movie is marvelous, beautiful, and philosophical.

I don't have a favourite film, but this one almost made it to #1 on my list, I can't believe how a film could impact my life with just the first 10-15 minutes. The cyberpunk, dystopian los Angeles is beautiful yet kinda creepy. The city reminds me of the Rapture from another great game BioShock which I also love. It may look like a Sci-Fi or a special effects extravaganza but really it's a story of Freedom, love and creation. It beautifully mixes genres such as Drama, romance, a little bit of horror and obviously a noir-thriller.Blade runner was a film ahead of its time which explains how it bombed at the box office but like other films that came out during that era, it is now a classic. It was very influential because of how it inspired many other Sci-Fi thrillers or just Sci-Fi movies to come such as Total Recall, The Terminator, Equilibrium and more. Even though this film is praised by audiences and critics i still feel this film is underrated. I cannot help but feel myself immersed into the dystopian los Angeles and why do I feel immersed well it is because of its slow and beautiful cinematography that shows almost every detail of this cyberpunk world. Some people may feel that this film is just pure eye-candy but it is definitely more than just the city of Los Angeles, its about Replicants that just want more life and freedom so that they could live like other humans. What makes replicants so human is the fact that they don't wanna die like every other human. But they are seen as evil cyborgs because they do anything to get what they want. That is also the issue with humans as well because don't we also sometimes do stupid or bad things to get what we what like hackers for example, they hack the internet and other brands to get money which sounds even more evil because these nexus 6 replicants don't want money, they just want to live.My conclusion is that Blade Runner is a gorgeous, creepy and groundbreaking masterpiece that asks fascinating questions such as what does it mean to be human?

BUT: where is the story? I have watched this film many times, and I could never get immersed in the story, especially the moral message. It is all so superficial and useless. What really irritated me is that the film never develops the love story it starts. The love story should have been the emotional and intellectual core of the film. All the issues a 'replicant' can face, regarding their identity, purpose, or attitude towards death, could have been explored through the love story. Hell, you didn't even need Rutger Hauer and his gang of weirdos who go around killing people. The climax of the film should have involved Harrison Ford and his love interest. If Hauer was to be in the climax, he should have tried to kill the girl and not Ford. That would have been far more satisfying. Instead, the women disappears from the plot as soon as the love story starts, and we watch Hauer go on his vendetta. I did not want to see him and I didn't need to see all those action scenes. This film never should have been an action film to begin with, but rather a detective love story in the film noir style. The action just ruined it all, as far as I'm concerned. Also, this film is such a masterpiece in terms of style, and screams 'A movie', yet Hauer, as likable as he is, is an icon of B movies. This didn't sit too well with me. I felt like I was watching two films: one a B movie with Hauer wreaking havoc, and the other a detective film noir with a doomed love story. And the two don't fit well together.I give this film two stars: one for the visuals, and one for the soundtrack. But I hate the plot. And it is Ridley Scott's failure that he focused entirely on style, and didn't care about the plot itself.

Since I was used to the more modern cyberpunk at the time (a la The Matrix (1999)), I felt the slow unfolding of exposition wasn't nearly as action-driven as I had hoped it would be. Of course, at the time, I might not have been watching the \"Director's Cut\" version of Blade Runner, which was what I watched this time around. Needless to say, it's a much better movie than I initially remembered.I think part of my improved assessment of this film came from a realization that it wasn't intrinsically a science fiction film. Sure, it is based on a story by Philip K. Dick, it is set in a fast-approaching and somewhat inaccurate representation of the future, and it has the trappings of a sci-fi film (i.e., androids, flying cars, technology, etc.), but at its heart, Blade Runner owes more to film noir than I realized. Take away the science fiction exterior, and you're left with the stark shadows filtering through the mists of cigarette smoke and humid clouds of Los Angeles while a \"detective\" tracks down the antagonist(s) of a crime. Classic noir.Probably because I hadn't seen a lot of film noir before seeing Blade Runner the first time, I never could have made the connection that this film is not what it seems, almost becoming its own allusion to the \"hidden android\" motif. Sure, Blade Runner still stands as a founding film of the cyberpunk subgenre of science fiction, but it only does so through the superb atmosphere and ambiance that is created via the noir style from classics like Chinatown (1974) and The Third Man (1949). Clearly, director Ridley Scott knows how to infuse science fiction into other genres, with Alien (1979) combining sci-fi with horror, and Blade Runner combining sci-fi with film noir.A superb homage to film noir contained in the skin of a sci-fi movie, I give Blade Runner 5.0 stars out of 5.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 3}, "heading": "A superb homage to film noir contained in the skin of a sci-fi movie.", "date": "2019-03-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4705971"}, {"content": "Greatest movie ever, it gives me chills everytime.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Awesome", "date": "2019-02-24T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4683390"}, {"content": "Its good.

So why did I walk away so bitterly disappointed?The film starts out promising - the world that serves as the backdrop for this story is beautifully crafted and visually stunning, and the soundtrack only adds to its shadowy intrigue. We are introduced to Replicants, A.I. that are essentially on par with humans as far as intelligence and appearance, as well as the Blade Runners that hunt them when they \"go rogue\". We are also introduced to the film's most interesting character, Rachel, a Replicant who has had false memories programmed into her and believes herself to be human. Unfortunately, although Rachel and Deckard's interactions comprise the most interesting parts of the movie, they take up very little screen time.INSTEAD, the film follows Deckard around as he orders food, looks disgruntled while sitting in a bar, questions people, and finally tracks down four different rogue replicants. This is where I realized the film wasn't going anywhere: there's a shortage of compelling or realistic characters. Each character in this film felt either uninspired or REALLY hammy. The first replicant Deckard finds is posing as an exotic dancer (got to keep your audience's attention somehow, right?) and after a brief chase is shot down. It's a scene that I'm sure was supposed to make me question Deckard's morality as well as the humanity of replicants, but because I was so uninvested in both of the characters I really didn't care and found the whole scene as a gimmicky attempt to try to elicit audience emotion.Another replicant who is equally uninteresting runs around with all the nuance of a WWE performer until he's prompty shot, while the other two replicants who take up much of the remaining screen time are god-awful. There's a former hooker android who convinces a Tyrell employee to take her home and then proceeds to dress up like a coked out David Bowie who got lost in a Hot Topic. Of course, the house she hides in is littered with \"creepy\" dolls and clown robots - there's even robots dressed up as militarized clowns who welcome them at the door. It felt like a really uninspired and silly attempt to try to create something unsettling or distinct. The hooker goth replicant eventually changes up her style and dresses up like a doll to try to trick Deckard (who could have seen THAT coming?!) and then backflips around the room like a lunatic before she's unceremonious shot a bunch of times. It was hilarious.The final replicant felt like a waste. His story has so much potential - an android who's trying to locate his creator in order to override his cruelly truncated lifespan - but NOPE, forget subtlety, lets dress him like a 40-year-old who's trying out for an Alternative Rock band and have him deliver his lines like a caricature of a Hollywood villain. The ending was laughably bad. The replicant is running around like a melodramatic weirdo, chasing Deckard around, shoving his head through walls with no purpose other than to deliver ridiculous dialogue, jumping around the rooftop in just a pair of jean-shorts- and it all culminates in the laziest attempt at symbolism I've seen in a long time: he literally shoves a nail through one hand and grabs a wild dove in the other, then proceeds to run around like that (yes, dove in hand like a g-dd-amm werido) for the last 5 minutes of his scenes until he dies. Yup. SO LONG, DOVE WIELDING ROOF-JUMPING EYELINER GUY, YOU'VE BEEN GREAT.Overall I was really disappointed. I felt like this movie had an amazing premise and source material to draw from, fantastic visuals, lighting, soundtrack, etc, - but BOY did they miss the mark with what actually mattered. Maybe I would have gotten more out of it if I had watched it 10, maybe 15 years ago when the idea of A.I. consciousness was a lot more novel, but unfortunately, I doubt even that would have saved it.

This will be a record of what I honestly feel about the film following my first ever full viewing of it. Judging from a few I've read, I'm not alone in thinking this film is insanely overrated.I viewed the Director's Cut on Blu-Ray and I have to say, I don't get it. The scores I mean, and the general positivity surrounding this film. I went in without paying any attention to these things until after the viewing, only really knowing that the film garnered a fairly large cult following years later.So, to summarise the plot in my own words here, as I know people will likely point to people criticising the film as \"not understanding its deep and utter complexity\", here we go.Deckard is a former supposedly high ranking Blade Runner, an individual that is part of law enforcement in the year of 2019, whose purpose is to hunt down rogue \"Replicants\", these being hyper-realistic androids that look, sound, and act almost exactly like humans. Replicants are sent off to various locations for slave labour in this universe.Deckard is forced out of retirement by a higher up, as a handful of dangerous Replicants have managed to escape their slavery and have come back to earth to attempt to find their creator, and extend their lifespan, as Replicants are created to live very short lives.That's a basic summary, but is really all the film ever tells us about what is happening, ever, there's no evolution beyond this, no twists to keep us hooked. The pacing is so painfully slow that there's few details to divulge at all, aside from this summary. This is the concept and story of the film with a LOT of pointless quiet time splitting things up to extend run time and probably just to keep the budget below a certain threshold. Take it or leave it, love it or hate it.To get a bit more in depth on what actually transpires, there are a few gripes I have that I'd like to cover, which will be most relevant obviously to those that have seen the film.Firstly, why in the hell are you sending one man out against multiple dangerous renegade, SUPER strong androids that are on the loose, with little to nothing to go on whatsoever? Well that's not totally true. The chief has digital photographs of what these escaped Replicants look like in his office that he shows to Deckard, and you aren't sending out squadrons of heavily armed officers attempting to capture them? Why not?Think about this - Deckard is blackmailed into this job out of retirement because they need him so badly, right? So escaped Replicants making their way to earth in this manner must be an anomaly, so wouldn't that only make it easier to find the escapees with squadrons of officers? Especially if you have their pictures? Even if there's similar looking models, not very many of them are going to be on Earth at the same time, right? Doesn't matter I guess because the film doesn't explore this, and there's zero explanation as to why this has to be a solo mission for Deckard.Secondly, and as touched on above, Deckard is made out to be some \"incredible\" Blade Runner. The higher up/Chief, Bryant, that recruits him for the task, goes as far as to blackmail him into doing so when Deckard initially declines. Bryant apparently does all this because they \"need his magic\".They kick up so much of a fuss about how incredibly talented of a Blade Runner he is, but in just about every encounter, he's a complete mess, and is more often than not just landing on his back with blood pouring from his mouth. You would think this was his first week on the job with the perpetual look of confusion on his face and the constant battering he gets. WHY doesn't he have backup with him to locate these Replicants? It's a massive, gaping plot hole that is never addressed or explained in any way, we're just meant to accept that it is this way because \"movie has to happen\", despite it making absolutely no sense.The actual visuals of this film are by far the best part of it. For a film that's over 30 years old, it looks great. Granted, this is largely remastered for a HD blu-ray release, but the sets, costumes etc. Largely stand the test of time. This is about the most generous praise I can give the film.The Replicants themselves act just as brain dead at times, particularly the primary blonde haired duo, whose names I could not recall beyond their mention at the very beginning, looking them up, I see they are Roy and Pris. These two have the goal of tracking down their creator. Eventually they do so whilst manipulating one of their \"lesser designers\", JF Sebastian, forcing him to allow them access to their creator's penthouse.Roy is the leader of these renegade replicants, who goes alone with Sebastian to speak with his creator, and after requesting that his life be extended, he's basically told \"Yeah, I'm sorry but that can't be done, you're made to last this long and that's that\", then ends up gouging out his eyes, and killing Sebastian, for no reason, off screen... No really, why did Sebastian have to die?Roy is portrayed as an absolute joke in the final act, smashing his head into walls basically acting like Jack from The Shining in the most pointlessly drawn out attempt to kill someone I've probably ever seen, even going so far as to strip off his clothes for zero reason to make it even more comical. I couldn't take it seriously.Pris is given the literal most perfect opportunity to kill Deckard, because let's be honest, it seems like anyone could judging from his ineptitude in this movie, but I guess she decided she hadn't done enough backflips so she decides to let him go to get his gun and blow her guts out. Why...? Some people I've seen explain this away with the notion that \"well, she's not an assault based Replicant model, so she doesn't know how to kill someone\" (neither does Roy apparently at the end) but that didn't stop the other model, Leon, from shooting someone and beating the ever loving hell out of Deckard despite him being portrayed as an industrial model/worker? Also, you're telling me the incredible retired, magical Bladerunner, who was so needed for this job - can't handle a non-combat model like Pris to begin with? Why did they make this guy such a frightened, clueless clown? I thought he was meant to be good at all this?Back to Pris just briefly - Can the movie at least try to explore, and clarify these concepts in *some* way? We certainly have enough dead air to do so. Too much of this film expects the viewer to fill in the gaps, which is what I believe leads people to view this film in a higher regard as they can insert their own beliefs into it for things that aren't explained to the viewer to a conclusion. Even then there's contradictions displayed within the film on this point. Ultimately, I can only digest what is shown and explained to me within the film. Personal interpretation isn't an objective problem in a story but this film relies far too much on it throughout, rather than attempting to plug legitimate plot holes.Not to mention, these are androids. Synthetic beings. Who thought it would be a great idea to have their innards and blood colour be totally indistinguishable from ordinary humans? Something tells me that will just make it harder to narrow down any escapees. Maybe the creator wanted it to be this way, but perhaps regulation should have opposed the idea, or at least create a law that has some mandatory design implementation to where they can be easily identified immediately if they get loose? Doesn't really matter in the end I guess, because like many other points, nothing about it is ever mentioned or built upon whatsoever. I guess that's another point for viewer interpretation as well?How on earth is this film deep? It's a collection of non-sensical, illogical events that try so hard to make you think on some kind of deeper level, but they just totally fail. There's no mystery, these are renegade machines that are designed to be as human as possible, but aren't, with an inept agent attempting to capture them, and only succeeding due to pure luck.If I have more to add I will do so but there's really nothing much more to talk about, it's one of the slowest films I've ever seen that tries to make you think during the periods where nothing is happening, but it more often than not leads nowhere, or it leads into another problem and something else to complain about and just ask, \"why?\"Final score from me is 3/10, mostly on account of how the film looks and its general visual presentation.", "rating": 3, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 6, "votes": 11}, "heading": "As shallow as the rain puddles scattered throughout the movie itself.", "date": "2018-12-15T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4513104"}, {"content": "Blade Runner was an okay film that does its job decently, which is to entertain.

The film mixes extraordinary (well, for 1982) visual effects, great acting and a genuinely original and deep plot about what it means to be human.The plot, on a base level, concerns the exploits of \"Blade Runner\" Deckard as he hunts down rogue Reploids; advanced human-like androids that have a four-year lifespan to compensate for their other advantages. The rogue group, lead by Roy Batty, is looking to extend their aforementioned lifespans. This is really only a simple interpretation. The film is really about what it means to be a human being, especially when the reploids seem to demonstrate more humanity than the humans.Visually, the film looked in incredible in 1982, and still looks pretty good today. It's not just the backgrounds, but the incredible sets and mise en scene that truly bring the film to life in a way that makes it feel real. And as we approach 2019 (this review was written in Oct. 2018), the world of Blade Runner looks more and more eerily similar to our own.The performances in the film are just incredible. Harrison Ford as a depressing, inhumane drunk may not exactly sell itself, especially considering the types of roles he was known for playing at that point in time (i.e. charming rogue). However, Ford proves beyond all reasonable doubt that he can play his part, giving a stellar performance that allowed him to break free of the Han Solo typecast. But the real star of the show is Rutger Hauer, who gives a Shakespearean performance as Roy Batty. The soundtrack also deserves special mention for being varied and bizarre, and yet always managing to fit the scene perfectly. A deep, melancholy magnum opus, Blade Runner will surely be remembered as one of the greatest films ever made.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 7, "votes": 12}, "heading": "Beautiful Masterpiece", "date": "2018-10-10T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4389256"}, {"content": "Very good, but not as great as some people make it out to be.

The first being the stunning aesthetic from beginning to end. Ridley Scott went above and beyond with his use of visual stimulation from the very first scene to the moment credits begin to roll. My second main characteristic of Blade Runner is the complex story happening in the background and the many nuanced clues that don't show themselves until the third of fourth viewing of the film. The screenplay is often seen as \"boring\" and \"slow-paced\". But after a deep analysis, nearly every second of the film is crucial to the not only the story, but the masterful tension throughout the story. \n By itself, Blade Runner is a genre-defining film. Very few films before it had doven into the science fiction genre with such unique style. This style is a large reason for the film becoming relevant in pop culture. The dystopian pollution paired with the neon, over-stimulated, corporate propaganda make the iconic Blade Runner aesthetic that many come to know and love. The deep blues and purples and the overall dark color palette is gloomy enough to set the tone of the film but beautiful enough to keep the watcher engaged. Speaking of visuals, the CGI is crucial to the discussion. By modern standards, the CGI was decent. But for this level of detail and clarity to be achieved on such a grand scale back in 1982 is nothing short of amazing. This film is made for the movie watchers with a taste for visual beauty. \n Even beyond the visuals, the rest of the film is fantastic. The soundtrack written by Vangelis is very fitting for the film. It's very unique, and helps guide the viewer to the themes of each scene. I could also write an entire paper on the complexity of the story itself, but I will stick to the amazing story within the story. On first viewing, the superficial story of Decker finding and killing rogue Replicants is obvious. After a deeper analysis, an even deeper story emerges. Replicants are usually easy to identify with the red tint of the pupil, and can be even better identified with the heightened strength, durability, etc. But after a deep analysis, the story quietly suggests that Decker MIGHT be the very thing he is payed to kill. A single scene with his pupils glowing for only a few frames and the Unicorn issue have sparked debates that rage on to this day. This kind of storytelling, that refuses to answer a question that would change the entire story, while also hiding the question under another story is truly amazing. \n The core message of Blade Runner takes all of the different story elements and squishes them down into a single question. \"What does it mean to be human?\" The answer to that question is different for everybody, and that is just another layer of genius in this story. There is no true answer. No one can definitively say where human consciousness ends and the mind of a Replicant begins. Many believe that emotions are the key to being human, Decker's love interest (key word: LOVE), Rachel, is confirmed to be an experimental Replicant. This is the genius of this film. The key question of the film is intentionally complicated in order for the watcher to come to their own conclusions. The line between humans and Replicants is blurred and bordering on non-existant.\n In conclusion, Blade Runner is a masterpiece. The color palette is dark yet stunning, the soundtrack is subtle yet engaging, the pace of the story is slow yet efficient, the story is unique yet amazing, and the message is valid yet frightening.

The film gets its title from the job title Deckard uses. Those that hunt these androids are called Blade Runners, and they aren't seeking to arrest the androids, but to gun them down. Deckard is played by Harrison Ford in the prime of his career. He pursues four androids with the most prominent being Roy Batty, played by Rutger Hauer, and Pris, played by Daryl Hannah. Deckard also develops a romantic relationship with a woman named Rachael, played by Sean Young. The theme of Blade Runner intends to cause us to question the morality of building machines with the capacity to feel and think as a person would. It's difficult to argue that some of the androids in this film aren't persons. I think the film does an excellent job establishing that with the relationships we witness the androids build and the feelings they demonstrate. One of the motifs the film uses is a repeated line that equates living in fear to living as a slave. This excellently scripted line establishes the androids' personhood because they show an understanding of emotion and remind us of the immorality of the literal slavery the androids are born into\n. \nThe most distinct part of Blade Runner is probably the setting which demands impressive special effects, lighting and most importantly set design. As Blade Runner is a futuristic sci-fi story set in a major city, the film must show an advanced metropolitan landscape. Blade Runner uses some special effect heavy aerial shots to do this. These shots show flying cars, skyscrapers, flame billowing industrial towers, and large futuristic moving advertisements. This shows us a city that looks far more advanced than our real world, but also very believable. The lighting in this film is also well done. As Deckard and the androids traverse the city the grim and dank lighting of the sets tell the viewer that this city is far from a utopia. For the little people, the city is an unpleasant place to live despite the prosperity of business. The lighting differs for different environments. In Deckard's meeting with the Tyrell corporation, the lighting is low-key and primarily a golden hue. This worked well to suggest the prosperity and shadiness of the corporation. In another setting, the apartment of an eccentric genetic engineer, the lighting makes the engineer seem strange and lonely. The bizarreness of the robots that roam is home is only enhanced when they're casting their shadows. The set design in this film is great. The set for the high-rise meeting room at the corporation is beautiful and exudes wealth and style while it overlooks the futuristic city. The street level sets the tone of the movie as a noir film with frequently foggy and wet sets. The use of water has an extra benefit of reflecting the futuristic city's lights. My favorite set design is the genetic engineer's apartment. This set uses strange mannequins, puppets, and costumed actors to set up a strange environment. The difference between this apartment and the businessman's apartment work well to show the income disparity and their different personalities. Although the film presents its themes well and has great world design, it does have some small issues. One problem is that it's paced pretty slowly. I think this is because the director really wanted to immerse the viewer in the world, but this causes some unnecessary downtime. A good example is when Deckard is investigating the snake scale he finds. This scene is uninteresting and too long. It has poor dialog audio during Deckard's confrontation of the snake seller. These scenes probably could have been edited down without taking much from the film.In closing, I enjoyed this film and how all the parts work together. It presents its themes very well through characters and their dialog. The special effects are appropriate and never overdone or distracting. The lighting adds to every scene and helps the viewer immerse themselves in this setting. The sets are expertly done and feel like they could be real places with real people living in them. It does have some issues, but the film overcomes them with the quality of everything else.

Yes, it's from Alien director Ridley Scott who would later give us movies such as Gladiator and The Martian. But Blade Runner is much different. It certainly has sci-fi appeal and influence-- video games such as Final Fantasy VII and Mass Effect clearly took notes from the film, and directors such as Christopher Nolan have cited this film as inspiration, but it also doesn't fall into the trippier territory of films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey. Based on the cleverly titled book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep by Philip K. Dick (he died before the release of the film, but praised what he saw which was about the first 20 minutes), this movie is much more philosophical. Perhaps Blade Jogger would be a more fitting title-the pacing is very deliberate and not at all what I was expecting. The movie stars Harrison Ford who was determined to not wear a hat because he was just coming from Raiders of the Lost Ark. The year is 2019 and genetic engineering has advanced so far as to create androids, or replicants, that are superior in intelligence and physicality. Their telltale sign is their responses to questions that are supposed to evoke human emotions. Created to work as slaves, replicants have rebelled in off-world colonies (remember this is 3 years from now) and are declared illegal on Earth and are to be terminated (they use the word retired) if found. This is where Ford comes in when it's discovered that 6 replicants have returned to Earth. Obviously, this has all the ingredients to be a thrilling action flick. But it takes a much different direction. Replicants are designed with a failsafe that automatically retires them after 4 years. It produces cool, thinking quotes like, \"It's too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?\" Ridley Scott liked the idea of Ford being a replicant, but Ford has stated that he despised that idea and said that before filming Scott agreed with him that his character is definitely human. Now I won't spoil anything, but I will say that it's a question toiled with during the film. Also, if you watch the movie, watch the director's cut version (which technically isn't fully Scott's cut) because the ending is much much better than the theatrical cut of the film. Really, above sci-fi or philosophical or whatever, I'd describe this film as weird. I'm not sure what you're expecting from the film going in, but it's not what you're going to get. There isn't ever a clear tone established, and this just adds to the difficulty of describing just what the film is. Even the highly-regarded score switches from slow, dark melodies to jazzier moments. I will say, however, probably the most consistent element of the film is the lighting. It's certainly always on the darker side, but all the ways the light comes through in every scene is skillfully crafted. In all honesty I can't even say I'm much of a fan of this film. I didn't care for how it was edited, and some of the sub-plots really were weird. The movie succeeds in getting you to think, but it also makes you wonder what you just watched. I'm not sure how many times or how precisely I can say it, but it's a strange film. Not strange like drug-fueled Trainspotting, and not confusing like Stanley Kubrick, but more cerebral like the very ends of the films 28 Days Later and Sunshine.

This was one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time.This is supposed to take place far in the future, where people can make clone robots, and live on other planets, and have flying cars, in....2019.... I think they missed the mark a bit there. Everything looks remarkably like the 1980s, except for the flying cars. There are no special effects, no fancy computers, not even cell phones. Everyone has the 80s hair styles. Without the flying cars, I would have assumed this took place in the 70s or 80s. But...you can't fault someone for not knowing the future.If they didn't explain the story line with text in the first 30 seconds of the movie, there would be no coherent plot to this movie. An ex-cop gets forced into hunting down 5 robots that escaped from their planet and killed a bunch of people on their way to earth. These robots have a 4-year lifespan. Here's where the movie gets ridiculous. What they didn't tell you is that all of these clones were on about 3 years and 364 days, and they were just about to die anyway, making the entire premise pointless. Nothing about this movie makes sense and the acting/dialogue is beyond horrible.If this cop is their last hope, the world is screwed. This is the most useless cop ever.

Seriously, she escaped her planet and killed 20 people to become a stripper? When he confronts her, she almost kills him, and then inexplicably decides to put on a see-through puffy rain poncho and run away. His third target is about to kill him and he gets saved by the robot he fell in love with. His fourth target is about to kill him, but instead decides to pick his nose, and then do gymnastics. Then he shoots her while she's doing flips. His fifth target is again about to kill him, but he instead decides to go hand him his gun back, go kiss a dead robot, and pet a dove. Instead of killing him while he was doing this, the main character drops his gun and decides to climb to the roof?

However, the emphasis of the film is not placed on the setting, nor is it placed on the usual trappings of the sci-fi genre (think galactic dogfights or laser battles), instead the focus of the movie falls squarely on one central theme; the nature of humanity - our emotions, our mortality, and our purpose. These themes are elegantly told through the story of a policeman, Deckard, who is tasked with hunting down a group of Replicants (genetically-engineered humans) and it does so with great success.The only shortcoming I can think of for this otherwise stellar movie is the comparatively thin plot, it is clear that it was merely a tool, subservient to the greater aims of the director's vision but this is just a nit-pick as the movie's purpose was to communicate deeper questions of humanity, which it did very effectively at the expense of its detective story.In fact, the plot's subservience to the themes of the movie is what makes this movie stand out, it is well-constructed and inter-connected in almost every aspect. Each facet of the movie's design is in service to the key themes of the movie which keep you intellectually stimulated and emotionally invested throughout the entirety of the runtime, nothing feels superfluous or in need of trimming, the structure of the film was near flawless. The themes were clear, effectively communicated and excellently given voice to by the entire cast, with Rutger Hauer's stand-out performance being particularly haunting, intriguingly sad and profound.As previously mentioned, this movie doesn't rely on the grandiose spectacle that many sci-fi films are wont to employ, but that isn't to say that the film is not visually stunning. Rather, the bombastic spectacle has been substituted for a far more subtle (and far more effective) approach. Visually, the movie strikes a very unique tone, the dirty, poorly-lit scenes result in a sense of unease and anxious turbulence that underscores the entire film, intensified by the uncanny but brilliant soundtrack by Vangelis which had an eerily spiritual ambiance to it. Blade Runner makes great use of its claustrophobic atmosphere, thriving both in moments of tension and contemplation all with a slow, deliberate pacing that gradually builds momentum until it finally delivers a powerful and chilling climax, leaving the audience to ponder the questions it has posed. The message delivered is not one spoon-fed, it is left to the viewer to piece together of their own accord to then discuss and debate. Blade Runner is a probing examination of the very nature of humanity, it confidently delves into deep philosophical themes and encourages the audience to consider and debate them. It accomplishes what I believe to be the crowning achievement of any form of art, it pushes the viewer to look at himself and the universe around him, and think.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 3}, "heading": "Blade Runner: Final Cut - review, 9/10", "date": "2018-04-22T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4138350"}, {"content": "What does it mean to be human? The lines between man and machine are blurred in Ridley Scott's 1982 science fiction classic, Blade Runner. There are numerous theological, philosophical and literary references within the film (and many more within Phillip K. Dick's original story, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?) from the New Testament and Descartes to William Blake. The film, like all good works of philosophy, leaves the central question open for debate, however there is much evidence to suggest the filmmaker sympathizes heavily with that which cannot be defined as \"natural.\"\n \nIn a show of intellectual superiority, Roy Batty, leader of the replicants recites an edited verse of William Blake: \"Fiery the angels fell; deep thunder rolled around their shores; burning with the fires of Orc.\" The original passage from America: A Prophecy reads as follows: \"Fiery the angels rose, and as they rose deep thunder roll'd. Around their shores: indignant burning with the fires of Orc.\" In context, Roy, along with all of the replicants are the \"fiery\" angels. They have come to the ruins of Earth (Hell) from the outer colonies in order to extend their lifespan and have brought with them their anger and resentment (\"deep thunder\"). Roy talks of living in constant fear as slaves do. This mission of extending their lives is their revolt against their masters. \nAs the story progresses, the replicant characters become more and more human while Deckard, the main human character assigned to \"retire\" each replicant, loses touch with his humanity. He becomes desensitized by his monotonous, machine-like assignment, and his connection with the replicants grows stronger the more human they become. His love affair with Rachael is the only thing that allows him to grow an empathetic bond with the replicants, making each subsequent kill harder and harder.\nWhen genetic engineer J.F. Sebastian meets Roy and Pris, he expects them to behave like the machines and toys he creates. \"Show me something,\" he asks. Roy swiftly responds with, \"We're not computers Sebastian. We're physical.\" Roy, although conscious of being a replicant, firmly believes that his superior intellect and strength give him human qualities. He understands his life has value, however he lives as a slave on the run with an immanent expiration date. The human race sees him as nothing more than a liability; built as a Nexus-6 combat unit replicant to be decommissioned after four years in order to prevent any sort of rebellion or usurpation of human control. Pris follows up with some Descartes, \"I think, therefore I am.\" The question is, who is more human, the replicants or their creators?\nDuring the final confrontation between Roy and Deckard, we see Roy as an allegory for Christ. He shoves a nail into his palm in order to feel pain, as he knows that he will expire soon. Roy also carries a dove, the symbol of the Holy Spirit, and saves Deckard despite the sins he committed towards both he and his friends. We as a species have not only created something with superior-strength and intellect, but perhaps superior morals. Roy is a violent man and his actions are questionable, however he stands for his people and what he believes in. He values life so much that he saves Deckard so he may live the rest of his. The final \"Tears in rain\" monologue is heartbreaking, especially considering he is not human. Roy has given us reason to believe he is better than human. He is a god.\nHow can we stay in touch with our humanity? Is it our right to play God? Are we fit to judge which species deserve human rights and which do not? These are questions that skeptics, scientists, followers of Nietzsche and many others have grappled with.

It became a classic due to the great representation of a dystopia, i.e., a projection of the future that creates mixed feelings. Great technological advancements, and on the other hand, misery and low quality of living (actually... survival). The wealthy people abandoned the earth for other planets due to the depletion of resources. It is inhabited now by the poor, what is today... the cultures of the developing world. The way this environment is depicted and the human responses it triggers, created a uniqueness that made the movie a cult classic. The scenario is of lower importance. Eventhough it is strong, it is there just to exhibit this great dystopia. Most actors play their roles in a satisfying way. The fact that some of them play replicants (bio-engineered humans), doesn't deter them for portraying vivid human behaviour (like sarcasm, fear and protective instincts, among others). This is a key factor for the success of the movie, i.e., not behaving in a mechanical style that lacks human traits. They are still humans and this is connected to the audience in a great extent.Another integral part of the movie's DNA is the soundtrack by Vangelis. The former is difficult to exist without the latter and vice versa. It adds a great soundscape to the environment that provokes a feeling of melancholy and paranoia. Consider as an example the death moment of the replicant leader. The electronics (mostly analogue synthesisers) of the early '80s are exploited to their limits providing a timeless experience.There's no other movie or series that comes even close to this dystopia. All attempts have failed miserably. There's a surprising exception though which is a trilogy of computer adventure games of the '90s by the main title \"Tex Murphy\".

Along with 2001: A Space Odyssey, it is one of the most philosophical and influential movies ever created, as it conveys a plethora of fundamental questions, which are woven in the very fabric of the human essence and existence. It seems near impossible to imagine a more suitable fusion of two of the most successful genres of all time, Science Fiction and Film Noir. By merging together the moral conflict and the emphatic character arc of the private detective, a trait that is exclusive to and definitive of the Film Noir genre, with a futuristic dystopian environment, Blade Runner creates the ultimate Neo-Noir setting, the only one capable of supporting such strong ideas and posing such significant questions to the viewer, without compromising on an interesting plot development and an appealing pace, things that are masterfully achieved via a tight script and persuasive performances.In a dark, future dystopian portrait of a 2019 Los Angeles, where humans have alienated themselves with their true nature and claimed the title of god/creator of life, effectively manufacturing artificial intelligence and bioengineering androids, called \"Replicants\", a retired \"Blade Runner\" named Rick Deckard is assigned with the undertaking of terminating four rogue such replicants that have illegally returned to Earth in a quest to force their maker, Tyrel, into postponing their grim destiny, basically prolonging their already predetermined four-year lifespan. Their greatest sin, however, is having the audacity of desiring one of the most sought-after values in the history of the human species, the freedom to live as they please. In this uneasy and twisted world, the lines between humanness and machinery are blurred and Deckard is faced with the consequences of the realization that not all is as it seems and there is more to \"being-alive\" than most believe. Blade Runner's unique depiction of the future has been imitated numerous times quite unsuccessfully, mostly due to the fact that no other film to this date has managed to create such an engaging atmosphere so beautifully connected to every part of it, effectively enhancing every scene and allowing for a strong conveyance of all the moral and existential questions that are posed during the whole duration. The audience is instantaneously absorbed by the vivid and compelling world depicted in the film, and that's where Ridley Scott succeeds the most, offering a glance into an original and somewhat disturbing reality that might very well be humanity's near future. The cinematography is impeccable, the art direction is gorgeous and along with some of the best visual effects that have ever been used in film-making, creates one of the most realistic and visually stunning environments that have ever graced a motion picture to this day. Vangelis has also composed one of the best and most awe-inspiring scores of all time, effectively managing to capture the very essence of each scene, thus making all sound a significant and inseparable part of the whole cinematic experience that Blade Runner has to offer. This thorough examination of what it means to be human isn't, thankfully, to no avail, as a careful observant, is forced to question their beliefs and attempt to choose a side on dilemmas that are still discussed by philosophers to this day, such as the traits that define humanity, the relativity that characterizes concepts like right or wrong, good or evil, as well as the meaning of life itself. The moral and existential complexity of this reality that Blade Runner has offered to the world reaches depths unparalleled by the majority of the films available, therefore greatly distinguishing it from all others and thus emphasizing its uniqueness through the most complete portrayal of science fiction to date.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 55, "votes": 73}, "heading": "One of the greatest Sci-Fi movies of all time.", "date": "2018-03-25T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4104082"}, {"content": "The fictional universe of the movie is great, and there are some parts that were unforgettable. but the story in this universe was not that interesting and fluent, especially when you think about its ending.", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 4}, "heading": "nice movie but empty ending", "date": "2018-03-20T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4098299"}, {"content": "Not much to say that probably hasn't been said about the film already, but just wanted to throw a quick two cents and a quick review at one of my very favorite all-time titles.

The first time being because of how highly my dad regards it and the second time being because I was forced to by the course I am taking in college. In all honesty, I enjoyed it at first. The long drawn out establishing shot of the city is amazingly beautiful and a nice way to start film when accompanied by the interrogation scene which follows it. The latter of these shots has excellent lighting and an intriguing intensity that drew me in and making me want more. However, it is that and only that which is led to me rating the film two stars because as soon as the gun shot of Leon (I think?) is shot the goofiness begins. How can such an apparently critically acclaimed film be so insanely awfully written with out of place dialogue and mumbling of Harrison Ford. To put it very simply, it is boring. The story is boring, the characters (with the exception of Roy) are boring and yes it may be very \"pretty\" but its all style and no substance. It seems that if you were ever in need of proof that there is a generation gap in existence this is the film to prove it. I could not count the number of 50 something year old adults on my hands who have said \"how damn excellent the final speech is\". This being the final speech where Roy pulls a dove out of nowhere and awkwardly explains how he is more human than Deckard will ever be. Deep? Yes. Worth the wait? No. Blade Runner, in my eyes, will go down in history as the film that teenagers who still listen to vinyl, were \"born in the wrong generation\" and like to point out that they make their own abstract films will regard as \"fantastic\".", "rating": 2, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 9}, "heading": "I have tried....", "date": "2018-02-27T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4076410"}, {"content": "See \"The Final Cut\" if possible.

Dick's \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\" had six different versions, until in 2007 \"The Final Cut\" was released. This seventh version allowed Ridley Scott to finally get the film closest to his original vision, without test audiences and studio pressures twisting it. I won't go into differences between versions and reasons why there's so many of them, because I didn't see them all and you can always google it.\"Blade Runner\" is one of those movies that should be seen in theater. It's made for big screen and you can't fully experience its visual magnificence by watching it at home. It would also be blasphemy to use lousy plastic speakers while watching this piece of art, not only because of Vangelis's music, but because overall excellent sound.Story develops in 2019, when nature is destroyed, human race colonized outer space and androids are used as slaves. The last generation of androids are almost undistinguishable from humans in body and mind, so there's a risk that they develop emotions and become unpredictable and dangerous. For that reason they are given life span of only four years and they are forbidden on Earth. Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Brion James and Joanna Cassidy are four of such Replicants who killed bunch of people, hijacked a ship and came to Earth to find their maker, in hope he could stop them from dying in four years. Harrison Ford is Blade Runner, member of special police unit whose job is to track Replicants on Earth and kill them on sight. Both sides, from their own point of view, have justified causes for their actions, so even if Blade Runner is our leading character you are meant to root for, if you put yourself in Replicant's shoes you'll realize that they didn't have much of a choice and you would probably do the same in their place. Movie doesn't serve all answers on a silver plate, some things are left to us to interpret and it opens some moral questions that will make you think.Performances of all actors are great, characters are very convincing, Sean Young and Harrison Ford have nice chemistry, and overall atmosphere achieved by Scott and Vangelis is stunning. Based on audio-visual magnificence and essential issues it deals with, \"Blade Runner\" could be compared to Kubrick's \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" (1968) and Kubrick's and Spielberg's cooperation \"Artificial Intelligence\" (2001), and I think it's safe to say those are three greatest SF movies made to this day. If you are interested in A.I. subgenre of SF, I would, beside these three, also recommend Spike Jonze's \"Her\" (2013) and Chris Columbus \"Bicentennial Man\" (1999). I must emphasize that last two are in my top five only because of their story, while in every other aspect they are far below any comparison with first three.10/10", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 3}, "heading": "Review for \"The Final Cut (2007)\"", "date": "2018-02-18T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4066464"}, {"content": "Los Angeles 2019; a group of replicants have escaped from their own planet and are illegally residing on planet Earth. Their reasons for escape soon become clear as they are searching for the man that created them in order to extend their lifespan. It's up to former Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) to find the replicants and eliminate them as soon as possible...Blade Runner is a film that had been in my watchlist for a number of years, but I finally managed to sit down and watch it today. Although it's dubbed as a 'classic' and a 'science fiction masterpiece' I tried to blank these thoughts out and try to take it for what it is and on that basis I found it quite enjoyable...Granted the film is a little slow-paced and Harrison Ford's narration seems a little bit cheesy, but the fundamental aspects of the story are quite intriguing - fair enough there have been some copycat films that have followed Blade Runner (the recent Alex Garland film Ex Machina clearly owes some debt of gratitude to Blade Runner). I think the interesting thing about this film is that the replicants are painted in quite a negative light, but to be honest I did find myself having some empathy with their cause - they seemed to just want answers and weren't happy that they were only programmed to live for a total of 4 years. Yes the way they go about their business is questionable, but their cause is somewhat understandable.A couple of failings with this film lie not with the story, but more with how it is developed; the replicants are represented as being self-aware, but emotionless yet other than this we are given little insight into them as characters. A lot of what I've said in the last paragraph are based on my own suppositions and whilst I don't mind figuring out some things for myself in a film I do feel as though I should be given something to work with in the first place. The same can be said for Deckard and his relationship with Rachael - she's an experimental replicant who is capable of emotion through brain implants (presumably in an attempt to fool the Blade Runners), but again this relationship is glossed over and isn't really given the attention that it perhaps deserves - which in some ways taints the warm and fuzzy way that the film ends.Where the film does excel is in its visuals - it's a striking and beautiful looking film (it's actually scary watching this film now realising that it's only 1 year before it was set). Rutger Hauer is chilling as the leader of the replicants and his final showdown at the end with Harrison Ford was fantastic. A notable mention also should go to Darryl Hannah whose crazy assed antics made her fun to watch.Blade Runner's thinly developed story and characters are the only really glaring flaws and are the main reasons why I can't bring myself to love it as much as many other people do.

Dark and uncompromising. With a haunting musical score by Vangelis that adds a hypnotic quality to those breathtaking megacity landscapes of future Los Angeles. Ridley Scott's adaptation of Philip K. Dick's post-apocalyptic bounty hunter story 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep' is a visionary work of art; it's a dystopian masterpiece and I'd personally call it as much a milestone of science fiction as Kubrick's '2001' (and be advised to watch the version known as the \"final cut\" if you want to catch 'Blade Runner' as it was intended by its director). It's hard to overstate how influential the film was; it invented the sci-fi subgenre now known as \"cyberpunk\", and it was also the first \"film noir\" in a sci-fi setting. And although it looks so distractingly gorgeous that even today there are people who still dismiss it as superficial and mere \"eye candy\", it is a philosphically deep film that ponders existential questions about the nature of being human.

I will say, however, that despite this movie's advanced age, I only just recently screened it. So, since I missed the timing boat for reviewing, I'll quickly comment on the film's CGI (Computer Generated Imagery).I consider myself a little bit of a nerd but I'm not really into the sci-fi genre like many-a-nerd - I enjoy sci-fi as much as any genre; I am a fan of all movies in general. I have seen countless films where CGI is an important part of the story telling, science fiction or not. Seeing Blade Runner less than 36 hours after binge-racing Altered Carbon (2018), the big-budget Netflix series that has been compared to Blade Runner, I noticed the 35-year-old CGI to be (still) quite impressive!The scenery, the futuristic look and feel, of Blade Runner and Altered Carbon is nearly identical in its presentation (the same can be said for Ghost in the Shell with Scarlett Johansson and, yes, even the new Blade Runner). The only real noticeable differences are the overall length of each scene containing CGI, and its attention to detail (like more flashing lights and moving objects in the background). The reasoning behind this, one can presume, is overall cost and technology advancement. I remember in the early 1990's the price tag for basic CGI ran around $1000 per second of rendered video. I can imagine that in 1982 the cost was even more stupid, thus limiting the amount of time CGI could be used (add to that the cost of optical effects-like credits and other on-screen writing- and you're looking at a hefty bill).Blade Runner's budget was $28 million in 1982. Based on an annual inflation rate of 2.64% per year, that budget would be something like $71.5 million now, or about $80 million less than the budget for Blade Runner 2049 ($150 million - coincidentally rumored to be Altered Carbon's 10-episode budget). Fast-forward to 2017 and pretty much anyone with a $600 laptop and the right software can create similar CGI if they have the time to invest in modeling and rendering. Can you imagine what Blade Runner would look like with today's CGI? Well, look no further than Blade Runner 2049. I must point out a little irony in that the Blade Runner from 1982 takes place in the futuristic 2019.My point is, Blade Runner, from a technical stand-point, impressed me as much as Altered Carbon and Blade Runner 2049. Everything is relative, of course. So, one would expect somewhat more of a wow factor out of a new sci-fi release than one that may be older than themselves. Blade Runner (1982) CGI can still hold its own. I can vaguely remember when Blade Runner was first released the talk of Hollywood was the \"special effects\", as it was generally known back then. The movie was nominated for two Academy Awards \u00ae: Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Effects, Visual Effects. Today that's called Best Production Design and Best Visual Effects - two of Blade Runner 2049's five Oscar nominations this year.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Blade Runner CGI Is Still Relevant", "date": "2018-02-04T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4052439"}, {"content": "Plenty of in-depth analyses can be found on RT or IMDb singing praise of a sci-fi classic that is older than Matrix and Gattaca and yet touches the question of \"What makes a human human?\" more convincingly than virtually all movies that came after it.I'll cut myself short for one message:WATCH THE DIRECTORS CUT. ONLY.The initial reception of Blade Runner in its \"Theatrical Release\" was what it deserved, something around a 7/10. Because it was streamlined for a mass audience upon release, simplified to a detective story. The \"Directors Cut\" rectified this, thankfully, by adding crucial scenes (unicorn, the \"Immortal game\" as Tyrell's chess match) in favour of the botched ending for a much more thought-provoking and enigmatic movie. The slightly inferior, \"Final Cut\" version turned it into more of a modern action movie: Whilst still an enjoyable version to watch, it is a little on the nose, pushing its message forward and lacking the subtlety and precision of the DC. It's also more graphic - which, in this movie, is arguably entirely unnecessary.There is Science Fiction like Terminator, and there is Science Fiction that utilizes a futuristic setting as a stage, set to ask a question. The narrative serves to make it a little more appealing, the profanity to make it a little less pretentious. You may like Sci-Fi or you may find it ludicrous.

The writing was well done and created a universe that is believable but also futuristic and unreal at the same time. I think that not all that credit can go to the writers though and i can in part go to the wonderful directing done by Ridley Scott. The story arcs of every character seemed to have a beginning, middle and end. These story arcs flowed well and allowed the villain of this movie to get a good amount of screen time. I prefer movies that hide the villain in the shadows but show them off in a few scenes that leads up to the final dramatic showdown between the hero and the villain and this movie delivers just that. If the villain is great though we need to have a equal hero as well and that's just what we got. Rick Deckard was a interesting character to follow and his character was intriguing and made me want to find out more about him as a character. The only bad thing I have to say about the writing is that the movie did seem to drag at points and became a bit boring in parts. To the point where I was very eager for something that was interesting to happen again. These parts did seem to come and go faster than some movies in modern day cinema. Also the character named Gaff seemed a little underdeveloped and I would have liked to see his character fleshed out a little bit more.Now lets look at the acting and the cast of this movie. The acting for this movie was incredible. I don't have any flaws I can pick out from this. There was that scene where Rick Deckard did bad acting but this was done on purpose by Harrison Ford. It takes a good actor to portray a character that's bad at acting. The cast was also a amazing cast that consisted of Hollywood greats such as Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Rutger Hauer, Edward James Olmos and Daryl Hannah.I wasn't expecting much from the special effects and was actually expecting some quite bad effects whether it was practical or not. But what was in the movie was incredible for the year it was made in. (In case your wondering it was made in 1982). The effects still hold up today unlike the original Star wars effects which look a bit odd in today's cinema. Ridley Scott's unique directing style reminded me of the tone and vibes of what i got from The Watchmen. When Rick Deckard is climbing up the building to the roof in the final showdown scene the lighting, the cinematography, the music and the overall tone of it was very similar to that of how The Watchmen tone is.The ending and start of the movie are arguably the two most important parts of the movie. This movie did it very well. The start drew me in and already made me interested in the Blade Runner universe and the final battle was crafted beautifully. I really liked the part where Rick Decakrd got some of his fingers broken because it made it seem more realistic and didnt make the hero/main character have too easy of a win. One of the choices in this final fight was strange though. This choice was having Roy Batter push his head through a wall. This part made me laugh more than it did make me feel on the edge of my seat and into the fight. Before and after he stopped having his head sticking through the wall had me on the edge of my seat though. The very last scene did seem to end the movie abruptly and I think that just ten more seconds could have giving it a much more satisfying ending though. That is just me though.In conclusion this movie was fantastic with a few errors and problems and added up. But altogether this movie was entertaining and enjoyable. I am very eager to see what is done with the universe in the future whether it is another sequel or a comic or book series.

If the opening shot of the dark, futuristic landscape of 2019 Los Angeles seems at all familiar, it's either because you've witnessed this cinematic masterpiece before, or seen an ill-fated attempt to recreate this grim, claustrophobic future elsewhere. Blade Runner's classic status now seems almost ironic, given the film's disastrous reception upon its original release, and the countless different versions released since. Among others, there was the original 'workprint prototype', the U.S. theatrical cut, the international theatrical cut, the broadcast version, and The Director's Cut. I think most would agree with me when I say the 'Final Cut' is the definitive version, trimmed of Harrison Ford's rambling narration and the tacked-on happy ending that borrowed unused footage from Stanley Kubrick's The Shining.In the future, the Tyrell Corporation has manufactured bioengineered humans known as Replicants, commonly used for slave labour off-Earth. Granted the intelligence of their makers, the Replicants tend to start questioning their purpose, often resulting in mutiny and violence. To counter this, Tyrell has limited their lifespan to four years in the hope that they will die before such thoughts can even enter their mind. However, four Replicants (Rutger Hauer's leader Roy Batty, Daryl Hannah's Pris, Brion James' Leon and Joanna Cassidy's Zhora) have rebelled against their masters and made it back to Earth. It is the job of 'Blade Runner' Rick Deckard (Ford) to hunt the foursome down and 'retire' them before they can cause any real damage. Deckard questions the morality of his job, especially when he meets Tyrell's latest creation, the stunning Rachael (Sean Young), a Replicant who isn't aware of what she is.Blade Runner is simply astonishing on a number of levels. When Vangelis' score - a majestic combination of the classical and synthesised - kicks in early on, Scott's film becomes an experience on a whole other plain. The production design, which is a noir-ish hybrid of choking, rainy streets and golden interiors blackened by shadows, had never been seen before and hasn't been so effectively moulded since. This feels like a wholly tangible future, lived-in and almost familiar, and although we may not have flying cars, super-beings crafted by science or Atari as a thriving corporation, the future depicted in Blade Runner isn't much different to the world we live in today. The sets, special effects, music and editing are all combined by Scott to create a world we can almost touch. The fleeting moments of violence, something the film was criticised for on its original release, are fast, shocking and ugly. There's a scene in which a death occurs in slow-motion through various panes of glass which is almost beautiful to behold, but even this plays out with an air of tragedy. The line between good and bad is certainly blurred here.I haven't read Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick, but common opinion is that Blade Runner eclipses its source and then some. It's the stuff of dreams for science-fiction aficionados, going way beyond its thriller premise to touch on some big philosophical questions and ponder the very definition of being human. Hauer's masterful portrayal of Batty ends with a monologue improvised by the actor, and his speech is one the most memorable and quoted pieces of dialogue in cinema history for good reason. It is moving and stirring and will catch you off guard, forcing you to reflect on everything you have just seen for days after. Ford is impressive too, downplaying the goofy charisma of Han Solo and Indiana Jones and growing into the beaten-down, conflicted bounty hunter. But the real star here is Ridley Scott himself, who has never made a finer film, crafting a landscape that would go on to be the go-to aesthetic for dystopian futures. It would take either a stupid or unnervingly brave director to make a follow-up, but if any director has the ability to expand this universe into something even more spectacular, it's Denis Villeneuve.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "A turning point in science-fiction", "date": "2018-01-22T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4040901"}, {"content": "A film classic that I simply can't rank as the best science fiction movie of all time, as some have (after all '2001: A Space Odyssey' preceded it by over a decade), but it sure as hell ranks as one of the best!

The brilliantly crafted Sci-fi extravaganza, directed by Ridley Scott is based on a blade runner named Rick Deckard, played by Harrison Ford. He is given the quest to hunt down and kill four cyborgs, known as replicants: Pris, Leon, Zhora and Roy who is their leader. The deep philosophical questions that arise from watching the film makes it more interesting: \"What happens after death?\", \"What makes us human?\" and \"What's the purpose of this life?\". The director raises these questions but doesn't proceed to answer them in the film. The ambiguity of the film is what makes it successful as the audience are left with a cliffhanger.Films are a popular source of entertainment due to the use of sound, visuals, body language, tone and expression of voice. This is effective in creating mood, conveying emotion and getting the audience thinking. An affordance of the film medium is its cinematography which is defined as \"writing in movement\" (Bordwell 2013:160). In the film noir, strong backlighting, light shafts, contrast and rain were used in most scenes to give the film its personality and an atmosphere of uncertainty which is the films main theme.\"Light is central to creating the mood or atmosphere of a scene and can be used to highlight certain elements\" (Monaco 2009:86). The heavy use of neon lights, smoke and thick fogs combined with shots of towering buildings and police cars flying in line with air traffic, helped create a futuristic city that the audience could believe in. The use of smoke and black and white effect helped create a perfect setting for the film. It showed the future Los Angeles to be a gloomy, polluted, ghetto and rainswept city full of litter. The angles in which the streets were captured in, made the people appear like ants, giving a sense of an overcrowded street. Again, this gave the audience a glimpse of the what the future will be like. The cast were amazing in bringing their characters to life which added a lot to the coldness and darkness in the futuristic city.The soundtrack is another affordance of the film medium as it gives off a mood-controlling effect and captures the tone and theme of the film. \"The soundtrack carries the film; the images are dominated by it\" (Monaco 2009:181). The soundtrack by Vangelis in the Blade Runner helps represent a dark and gloomy world of uncertainty. In the scenes between Rachel and Deckard, the music is soft with the piano playing in the background to give a feeling of intimacy. Whereas, in other scenes, there is a more fast pace synth heavy track that works well with all dynamic movement amongst the characters. In the scene where Deckard retires Zhora, the combination of the slow motion with the blade runner blues playing in the background shines a light on the cold nature of the killing which gives it more emphasis.Overall, the Blade Runner is a masterpiece and deserves credit and remembrance for its breathtaking effects, the deep philosophical story, amazing cast and its dark, atmospheric tone throughout. I would definitely recommend watching the Blade Runner as I believe it to be one of the deepest and greatest science fiction films ever made.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Simply a thrilling and exceptional film", "date": "2018-01-04T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4023562"}, {"content": "One of my favorite film, Blade Runner is a well-written story with great acting, beautiful cinematography, amazing special effects, and a thought-provoking commentary on human nature.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "A classic.. deservedly so", "date": "2018-01-01T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw4020607"}, {"content": "Blade Runner 1982 is one of those movies which take place in the future, with a vast boost of scientific and digital evolution.\nSurprisingly, the concept was pretty good, but the movie could've been shortened to 1h30m, it felt so slow and underwhelming in many parts.\nOne of the biggest weaknesses is, it felt so incoherent, between each part and another, and how 'this' led to 'that', a viewer would be all confused\nNow, to logic, the plot wasn't so 'heroic', so that's a pro, but the con is, it didn't feel anything special type thing at all.\nThis movie plays the role of bedrock for Blade Runner 2049.

We get introduced to the \"replicants\" which are just basically extremely real looking, perfect versions of humans who are able to develop both feelings and a consciousness which is ironically the reason they are doomed to only have a 4-year lifespan. It's so interesting and frightening at the same time to imagine that we could make artificial life, only for it to develop into something stronger and more capable than ourselves and ending up with catastrophic consequences. Also the idea that these replicants value life much more than actual humans holds a very important message. Would we, if ever confronted with the problem of robots taking over, even deserve to outlive them?

None are programmed very nice to begin with as Deckard dispatches them amid shadow, neon and rain when in the film's climactic moment Roy the replicant played by Rutger Hauer is allowed a King Kong moment of provocative introspection.

To me the general slow pace make the film immerse you into Los Angeles, and despite its obvious exaggerations, this future feels real. The slow pace also establishes the beauty of this modern world, established through impressive cinematography, Vangelis's great soundtrack and of course the special effects. This is by far one of the best looking films of all time, and personally that look is really able to draw me in where the film might bore others. Some argue the story and characters are what hold this film back, however I would disagree. No one argues that Rutger Hauer's performance is bad, but many have problems with Harrison Ford's Deckard. To me, he is a sad depressed man who drinks, and abuses women. It's more subtle, and we can see that Rachel in the film probably doesn't like him at all, but just needs to find refuge. The whole replicant/human discussion is definitely interesting, and I won't spoil anything for someone who hasn't seen the film so they discover the debate for themselves.

Emmet Walsh) to continue his old job as Replicant Hunter. His assignment: eliminate four escaped Replicants from the colonies who have returned to Earth. Before starting the job, Deckard goes to the Tyrell Corporation and he meets Rachel (Sean Young), a Replicant girl he falls in love with.Let me start of by saying that I watched the Theatrical Cut of this movie. Not the Director's Cut or The Final Cut but the original cut that people saw in theatres back in 1982. And to be quite honest, I was disappointed. Perhaps my expectations were too high but I was just so disappointed by this film. Don't tell me that I need to watch The Final Cut to see the greatness in this film because that is redundant. The ORIGINAL Cut shown in theatres SHOULD be the best cut available so if they need to add to it then that is not right. Alas, I will try to watch The Final Cut and whatnot but if you think I'm being overly harsh or that I hated it, there is your answer. And I will stand by what I say.Firstly, let me say that this is not a bad movie. By no means is it a bad movie. In fact, there isn't really anything offensively bad in the movie and pretty much everything works really well. For starters, it's a gorgeous looking movie. I won't lie when I say that Ridley Scott isn't my favourite director of all time and that I don't think he's the visual genius many paint him as. Alas, this is a beautiful movie. The visual effects, the sharp editing, the excellent cinematography, the rustic theme of costume and sets; all of this combines together to make a visual treat, and that is my greatest strength in this movie.Next, the acting in this movie is great. Harrison Ford was pretty good as Deckard but I really don't think that this is even remotely his best role. He will always be Indiana Jones for me and nothing will ever change that BUT, I do definitely admire his performance in this. Then there is Rutger Hauer. Hauer delivers a truly exceptional performance and gives one of the better improvised monologues that I've ever seen. It IS an sensational performance and I give all credit for it to the actor, not Scott or the writing. Young was pretty good in the movie but I didn't connect to her in any way. In fact, I didn't really feel an emotional investment to any of the characters in this movie. None of them stood out as particularly well written and, while all the performances were good, none of them were that memorable. Hauer's character came the closest to being memorable but even his character was just above average. The story and premise are also pretty decent. The ending is up for debate on it's 'greatness' but I found it okay. I wasn't particularly wowed by anything they did though. The world they setup was a very interesting one and I would look forward to visiting it again. But, the story surrounding this world was just alright. It wasn't that impressive and it was just kinda of okay. It was fine but that is all it was.Perhaps I was overly critical of this movie. Perhaps. But if I've been told by the masses that this film will cure me, I fully expect it to. I do recommend this movie, however. It is a decent flick but I just really didn't connect to it on the level the masses did. I'll seek out The Final Cut and whatnot and try to watch them, and If my opinion changes I'll update the review. But apart from that, I didn't like the movie much. It looks nice, is well acted and has good world building but I just didn't care for it. Unfortunate really but I wont be revisiting this film anytime soon unless it is in the form of a different cut. I'll rate 'Blade Runner' 7 'Tin Foil Origami' out of 10, and I will recommend it; against my personal enjoyment levels.

Blade Runner requires ATTENTION, reflection, immersion, and philosophy about existentialism.*SPOILERS FINAL'S SCENE EXPLAIN*When Roy cries in the rain we can realize this: we don't see his tears, because the rain hides it. However we KNOW he is crying (a masterpiece subliminal scene). This scene reveals Roy's frustration and reveals that Time (or Death) actually destroyed all the experiences he lived (real or not), but importants for him by losting them, attributing insignificance to them.On another hand at the same scene the movie cut to the Deckard's face and what we see? Deckard's crying in the rain, but WE CAN SEE his tears highlighted. This time, the rain don't hide the tears. Why? Because this moment won't be lost in time, unlike Roy said. Because Deckard learned with Roy the meaning of what is be human, and what is the valor of life. In other words, Roy and his lesson won't be lost in time. He will be remembered forever, in one way or another.Now, when i saw the last Blade Runner 2049' scene, i've confirmed that theory (what made me cry): Joe (Agent K) laid down on the stairs, \"Crying in the Snow\". The snow represents the peace and calm with himself, but once more the movie show us his frustrate tears highlighted. WE CAN SEE his tears. Why? Joe, despite sadness and frustration, DIES KNOWING HE WILL BE REMEMBERED, unlike Roy, because he did (willingly, free of chains) the right (and relevant) thing by saving Deckard's life and providing the meeting with his daughter. In other words, these tears won't be lost in time, like tears in snow.So, both Roy and Joe, died doing the right thing that has eternalized in the world, unleashing important events, so that they will never be lost.

From it's themes and visuals to it's acting and stellar musical score, Blade Runner is a true gem of a sci-fi movie.Set in the future of 2019 Los Angeles, the story follows a retried cop or \"blade runner\" named Rick Deckard who is apprehended by a fellow police officer and brought before his former supervisor and is briefed that four androids have appeared on Earth illegally in order to enhance their lives. Following this, Rick goes to the Tyrell Corporation and meets its founder, Eldon Tyrell and his associate Rachael and performs a test on her to see if she is a replicant or not. Events then continue to pan out as Deckard continues to pursue the replicants while the replicants continue to seek out Tyrell to get him to give them more life.While many critics and film-goers have considered Blade Runner to be one of the best sci-fi films ever put to screen, the movie isn't your typical sci-fi romp and it does call for the viewer to pay close attention to what's going on and to use their brain and have appreciation for what is happening in order to understand what the film is conveying. As Blade Runner is a film that focuses on ideas rather than the familiar sci-fi spacecraft fights, high-tech devices, bizarre aliens or witty dialog, some people will have an issue with those not being in the movie, but it still certifies itself as a science fiction movie in its observation of technology's effects on our civilization, our journey as a species, and the very spirit of mankind itself. These subjects are arranged against an underlying investigation plot that advances nonchalantly but gently builds to a fitting conclusion as the observer is engrossed in the visuals and look of the movie. One complaint I've heard about the movie is that Deckard and the replicants are incredibly weak in terms of character evolution, but as this is a more confined and deep-thinking film, the main individuals are used as tools to reflect the motifs in the movie. Every main lead in the film mirrors a characteristic of humankind and yet they miss other characteristics for each one is shattered in ways that echo the fractured world in which they dwell in and were built. As for the movie's themes, they're some of the best in any sci-fi film like de-humanizing of the population though a culture fashioned by technology and capitalist overkill, the parts of the maker and his design, the shared slavery and character switching, emotion, thought, ambition, passion, malice, prowess over nature and the cosmos, death, demise, individuality, self-realization and the meaning of life itself.Ridley Scott is a master filmmaker and Blade Runner is the film that shows his directing talents in the best way and like Stanley Kubrick before him, Scott understands just how to illuminate a scene and the usage of fog machines and fans along with anything that alters light is what gives Blade Runner it's noir look and feel while leaving hints throughout the film to the most important question concerning Deckard and wither or not he is a replicant. The visual effects are absolutely outstanding with the incredibly detailed miniatures and matte paintings along with the plumes of fire and the flying cars make the world of Los Angeles come to life and it's clear that the effects people put their time and money into making the visuals and effects look as top-notch as possible and it works a treat. Easily one of the most gorgeous sci-fi movies ever put to screen. Apart from the visual effects, the other outstanding element that makes Blade Runner stand on it's own is the fantastic musical score by Vangelis. The approach he uses when composing is incredibly distinctive and the music is moving is every scene that it's used in. The movie's soundtrack flawlessly adds to the futuristic setting ad even aids in building the vibe of it's world. Some films like Star Wars or Jaws owe some of their achievements to their composers, but with Blade Runner being such a unique movie in terms of visuals and story, it still would have still been an awesome movie even with a contrasting musical score, but all the same, it's certainly one of the finest movie soundtracks ever composed.When it comes to the acting, it's absolutely flawless and some of the best of any sci-fi movie. Sean Young is wonderful as the experiment replicant Rachel, giving us a conventional yet compelling performance and it's a treat to watch. Daryl Hannah is great as Pris as is Joanna Cassidy as Zhora. Edward James Olmos is fantastic as Officer Gaff as is M. Emmett Walsh as Bryant, but it's Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer who are the stars of the film. Harrison is excellent in Blade Runner, playing a much more somber character than what he played in Star Wars or Indiana Jones, but it still makes for one hell of a performance. Ford speaks every word with a aura of coolness and effectiveness as well as maintaining a hard-edged yet sensitive appearance as Deckard. Rutger Hauer is on top form as the villainous Roy Batty and completely steals all the scenes he's in, especially with his speech at the end which is truly moving.Now I do have an issue with the movie and it's the romance between Deckard and Rachel, it just comes across as tracked on and weak, but aside form that, Blade Runner is a true sci-fi classic that changed the way we saw sci-fi and what the future could be.

Despite \"Blade Runner\" reaching a limited audience and developing a \"cult following,\" the film gets better and stronger with each viewing. Each time something new comes from the unseemingly layered narrative, motifs, and foreshadowing that makes it impossible to digest everything necessary upon the first viewing. Perhaps the film's strongest aspect is its thought-provoking themes about what it means to be human. If the story's very human replicants can actually feel emotions like humans, who and what are they? Where does the soul come in to play? What does it mean to \"retire,\" meaning execute replicants and how ethical is it? \"Blade Runner\" has the boldness to challenge the viewer about their own existence while still managing to feel optimistic, despite the heavier subject matter. Visually, \"Blade Runner\" looks incredible; especially the Final Cut version. Every frame of the piece is a work of art due to some wonderful cinematography by Jordan Cronenweth and meticulous production design by Lawrence G. Paul (\"Back to the Future,\" Predator 2\"). A large reason why \"Blade Runner\" is so well regarded could have something to do with their work in creating a genre of sci-fi that many films have been inspired from (Ghost in the Shell, Dark City, Soldier). \"Blade Runner\" is truly a work of art and should be seen by everyone at least once. It's a layered and satisfying story with excellent visuals and strong performances with memorable music. It's a unique experience and should definitely been seen. Preferably the Final Cut version if it's available.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 3}, "heading": "A beautiful and cinematic acquired taste.", "date": "2017-10-10T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3828396"}, {"content": "I can completely understand how this film has influenced the science fiction genre as it is visually appealing and the score is outright fantastic.Unfortunately that's where any good qualities for Blade Runner end.

While it was really great, I couldn't help but be disappointed in it, primarily because of how much I'd expected it to be the most grandiose piece of sci-fi ever seen, thanks to how unbelievably hyped up it is, but it just felt remarkably shallow in all kinds of philosophical discussions when compared to the book, not that they should be massively compared.A movie should stand completely alone from a book it is based on, and I'm trying not to link them too closely together here, but it's hard because the best draw of the book was how much it had to say in 200 pages, and the movie just has very little to say on humans and existence, period, making what I'd hoped to be the best part really just one of many good things in the movie.However, the film is a technical masterpiece. This is one of the greatest technical achievements in film. Everything looks unbelievably realistic, and makes the future feel incredible grounded. The neon lights and expansive cityscapes make for some of the most striking visuals I've ever seen in a sci-fi movie.Rutger Hauer pulls off the best possible performance he could've for this character. He is easily the best character in the movie, and the movie as a whole makes Roy Batty an interesting case study, which the book really doesn't do at all.Where the book and the movie both flounder though, is creating believable romance between Deckard and Rachael. In the book, however, this is not a central piece of the plot, and instead of just being sudden and weak-ish, feels incredibly off-putting and bizarre in the movie. The implications of them falling in love is still interesting, and that's easily the best part about Deckard's character in the movie, but it still doesn't make it a compelling love plot.The way the plot is set up is incredibly standard too. \"Here are four guys you need to kill; have fun.\" And there is no mystery or sleuthing in this cyberpunk noir, save one hilarious scene of Harrison Ford enhancing an image to ridiculous levels over five minutes.Harrison Ford is decent here, but is let down by incredibly weak character writing and a few strange acting decisions. His character is incredibly weak and bland, which was sad considering how many interesting dynamics there are with the Rick Deckard of the book.In the end, absolutely stellar production design and world detail elevates a decent story with decent writing and one really great aspect of the plot.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Unfortunately Disappointing But Still Great", "date": "2017-10-09T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3827352"}, {"content": "I'm a huge fan of just about everyone in this movie, including Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young and of course the director, Ridley Scott.

It has almost everything in a good sci-fi flick; breathtaking effects, a deep and philosophical story, good characters, amazing atmosphere, and a great cast. Harrison Ford brings his A-game with this one. This is probably one of my favorite performances of his. In my opinion this is Ridley Scott's best film, and one of my favorite movies period. Admittedly, when I first saw this movie I hated it. I gave the film another chance though and I grew to love it. The reason I didn't like it at first was because I wasn't in the right mindset for it. I was expecting a film like Star Wars which this is definitely not. You really have to be in the right mindset to view this. Blade Runner is not the movie you just pop in for a casual viewing to kill time or if you want to have a fun time. It's dark, atmospheric, philosophical, and has a downbeat tone throughout. This is most likely why Blade Runner didn't do well in theaters. This film came out the same year as E.T. Everyone wanted fun sci-fi which this film clearly isn't. Fortunately, over the years, it has become a cult classic, which it deserves to be.The film takes place in Las Angeles in the dystopian future of 2019. We follow a retired cop named Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) who is called back to the force temporarily. Several human-like androids called replicants have gone rogue and it is Deckard's job to bring them down.As I said, the film looks brilliant. I think the special effects are on-par with the Star Wars trilogy. Yes, it's not the most colorful looking film or very fun to look at, but that's the point. The film is going for a very realistic dystopian future with overpopulation, pollution, and very cultural. The acting is great particularly from Ford. The only characters worth mentioning are Deckard or the main replicants, Batty (Rutger Hauer). The story is told from their different perspectives. From following both of them we see both of their views on what it means to be human which is one of the main themes of the movie.There are things that can be seen as flaws with the film. When I first saw the movie there were many things I didn't like about it until I tried to see things differently. Firstly, the film moves at a fairly slow pace or, at least, it felt that way. This is a trait you see in most Ridley Scott films. The atmosphere and overall feel of the film is a little too good if that makes sense. If you are the slightest bit sleepy this film can easily put you to sleep. I just about fell asleep on my first viewing. I'd watch the director's cut or the final cut of the film if possible. In the theatrical cut you have Harrison Ford give narrations throughout the movie, and it just made the film even more of a snore fest. The film is trying to build atmosphere and enthrall you into the world it's created, but some people will probably have issue with it. It's not bad but I do think people will think the film is too padded-out.Another thing is the action scenes. The action in this film is not like Star Wars or Indiana Jones. Deckard is actually not a very good fighter. He gets his butt handed to him quite frequently by the replicants. This did really bother me on first viewing. However, I don't feel that way now. I think that the way they did the actions scenes made them feel more real. Besides, if they were to have Star Wars or Indiana Jones type action in this then it would conflict with the tone of the rest of the film.Overall, Blade Runner is a classic movie that should be seen at least once. Just go in with the mindset that this is not like Star Wars, Total Recall, E.T., War of The Worlds, or any of those sci-fi films and you'll be fine.

I remember seeing the film at a much young age but not understanding much of it at the time. I read Philip K.

The world built in Ridley Scott's film and the novel along with the complex philosophical questions proposed by this work of fiction make this piece of entertainment more engaging than just simple sci-fi or action movie. The film begins with a block of text explaining that the Tyrell Corporation has advanced artificial intelligence to a stage where they are equal if not better than humans. The resulting replicants are used in off- world colonization until a violent mutiny makes them outlaws on the planet Earth. Blade Runners are bounty hunters that hunt down these replicants.The initial scene shows Leon Kowalski (Brion James) undergoing a strange interview about a turtle flipped over in the desert and his memory of his mother when Leon stands up and shoots the interviewer. Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is eating noodles when Gaff (Edward James Olmos) picks him up in his flying car. The skyline is enchanting and the visuals in this film are still stunning twenty-five years later. Deckard receives an assignment from Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh) over whiskey. Skin-jobs, the derisive term for replicants, have taken over a ship and snuck back on Earth. Deckard refuses because he quit the job of being a blade runner but Bryant threatens him into cooperating. Deckard is given a list of Nexus 6 replicants to hunt down and heads to the Tyrell Corporation headquarters to test the Voight-Kampff machine to see if it can identify a replicant or human.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "A sci-fi classic with large themes", "date": "2017-10-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3825961"}, {"content": "the movie explores the deep depths of how ethical creating an Artificial intelligence and how they would act in a situation where they have limited lifetime and what would they do to gain more life .pros :the future of this movie is very nicely portrayed didn't needed any more explanation about the future cons : i think the main character was too weak while going against the Androids i get they are strong and faster than humans but as they say in the beginning Rick is the best blade runner out their but he struggled a lot while hunting those Androids .this might only be me but i didn't liked the music at all sometimes it was there and all of a sudden it goes and sometimes out of nowhere it comes i didn't liked it at all", "rating": 6, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 3}, "heading": "it was meh for me", "date": "2017-10-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3825784"}, {"content": "Blade Runner is an atmospheric though rather poorly done 'supposition' of the future by writers and crew who do not understand science fiction.

I thoroughly enjoyed every minute. It was also great to watch a film which, unlike modern films (I hear Bladerunner 2049 is 2.5 hours long), didn't feel the need to turn into a bum numbing epic!The special effects were excellent despite this film being from 1982. As with others of the genre (Alien, Aliens), I think animation special effects were just hitting the top of the curve prior to digital effects taking over. Interestingly the quality of the special effects mean that this film does not look dated, just like Alien and Aliens. All the scifi tropes were here (hover cars, evil tech overlord, sky scrapers with giant advertising, awesome synth soundtrack, odd futuristic clothing, the nerdy tech guy...) but the difference is that this film almost invented them inspiring many later films. The cars look quite outdated compared to cars nowadays, which made me laugh, especially as the film is set in 2019 and we're nowhere near that technology. The soundtrack is almost hypnotic, especially when Deckard is walking the streets, for example the \"cross, don't cross\" sign. Ford plays his role fantastically - he is best as the embittered rebel with a sense of humour. Rutger Hauer munches the scenery as always but maybe when you're playing a psychotic replicant who has stolen a ship to find your maker and extend your life then it's allowed. I felt genuinely sad for Rachel as she works through realising she is a replicant, her memories are implanted and her lifetime is limited. Although, the seduction scene made me slightly uncomfortable as it feels a little bit too on the non-consensual side. I had to look away when Roy crushes Tyrell's skull and presses in his eyes - that crunch is nasty.It's also interesting to read that Ford and Scott could never agree whether Deckard is a replicant. His dream sequence with the unicorn and his fellow blade runner making a unicorn out of paper seems to imply that his dreams may be implanted. Also, I had not before noticed the significance of him not answering Rachel's question about him having taken the test. Though it seems if Blade Runner 2049 is set 30 years after the original then Deckard must be human or he would have expired....This film does not have an overly complex plot but is a masterpiece nonetheless.

It was the version released in 1982, I think it was that year, so in this review, I'll talk about this version made that year, because it was the first version that I saw. So to write a review, I will report the first experience.I saw it for the first time and I was amazed at the visual department of the movie. A harmonious blend, with an exemplary cinematography. Incidentally, I was not the only one, because Blade Runner influenced countless people. It's a unique case where a quality of the film stands out more, which marks the film forever and the general public gets this impression. Blade Runner, and above all, a visual experience with little or no element of drama. It's a visual experience, and if people want to take advantage, they should leave that aspect aside. This is the highest quality of the film, the ability to enter the audience in a cohesive way in that universe and live a visual experience. It's like most sci-fi movies of the 80's, a movie with strong male influences. That is, you will get here, scenes of violence and some nudity to the mix. But Ridley Scott, controlled himself and did not let the train out of the line. Yes, you also have here the evil corporation, but it was done in a more discreet way possible. no exaggeration, of course This is the big difference between a mediocre director and a good director, having a good self-control. Putting things in your movie at random is too banal and mediocre.The characters were well written, though Scott could not take much advantage of the great actors he had. Ridley Scott always had the problem of not being able to take 100% of the juice of the actors and put human emotions in his works, even in dramas (e.g. G.I Jane). But in this film, Rutger Hauer managed to put a lot of juice himself, especially in the third act, in the confrontation with Rick Deckard, which left the scenes excellent and striking like a great character. In the end, the film does not need much drama element, because there is something bigger here. An exploration, a discovery, that goes beyond the dramatic element. I think Ridley Scott got this great virtue. You get to get interested in the movie, even though it has very little character depth. This is because Scott, is primarily a visual director. There was not in the early 80's, director with better imprint for the visual department. And this for me, is a mark of success. You have difficulty in a job, however find other ways to overcome this same job or task. It is a high quality and a proof of great capacity. As the great director that Scott is, he finds it difficult to achieve characters' depths and achieve human emotions. He was able to create an experience almost 100% depth only with a single department, in this case the visual experiment. But let's be realistic, cinema is primarily a visual art. And like a visual work, Blade Runner is perfect at what it set out to do.In addition to the timeless visual aspect of the film, Scott was able to insert an exemplary sound aspect that further helps the viewers to be inserted into the film in an exemplary and cohesive way. The soundtrack is almost perfect for this kind of movie, strong and simple. But very well built. The dialogue is also well written in this film. In spite of many clich\u00e9s and typical of the 80's, it ends up disturbing the experience a little, but it does not end with the experience of the film, but it hampers a bit in the final balance of the film. This is the proposal of this film, and if the film itself is consistent with its proposal, why not consider the film, a good movie. In the end, if you can overcome, the lack of dramatic element and depth of the characters, and the typical characteristics of the male productions. You will find here a great experience to live.

The film was written by Hampton Fancher and David Peopless. The film is based on Phillid K. Dicks novel: Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? There exists multiple cuts of the film, the most prominent being the theatrical cut, the director's cut and the final cut, which is the version i will be reviewing. We follow Blade Runner, Rick Deckard who is assigned to to \"retire\" 4 Replicants on Earth. The film is set in future Los Angeles where the replicants try to find there maker: Dr. Eldon Tyrell. Deckard now has to find the replicants in the polluted City before they can get to Dr. Tyrell. When i first saw Blade Runner i was quite disappointed, i thought the pacing was awful and the chemistry between Young and Ford was non-existing. However, after my second and third viewing something changed. It was also surprising to me that i was drawn back to the film again after the first viewing. I simply couldn't get Blade Runner out of my head and after the third viewing it became one of, if not my favorite film of all time. I began to take notice of all the small details that Ridley Scott put in the film. I discover something new every time i see the film. What also made me love Blade Runner is all the ways it can be interpreted. The themes of what it means to be human and life are strong themes, treated with such complexity through the visuals. What has been said a million times is that this is a beautiful film. I would say it's probably the most beautiful film i've ever seen. The film contains the best miniature work since Star Wars. The performances are a little mixed. Rutger Hauer gives in my opinion the best performance in the film. Ford gives a decent performance, Ford didn't really enjoy the shoot and Worning with Scott and he does come off as uninterested in some scenes, but i think it works for the film. It is a film noir and for that reason Fords' cold performance works. He really reminds you of the classic Humprey Bogart detective. It's Sean Youngs first film role, but she gives a decent performance. I've already talked about the visuals, but another standout feature of the film is it's music. The score by Vangelis is very unique and fits the film perfectly. The atmosphere of the film is enhanced to perfection by the score. For the above mentioned reasons i consider Blade Runner to be one of the best films of all time. You can enjoy the film for the visuals alone, but If you pay close attention you will discover a very deep and thought provoking sci-fi film.

It takes its time to play out and brings up many philosophical questions. Blade Runner is a visual and technical masterpiece but is not a very lively film that keeps you engaged and drags from beginning to end. The plot follows Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) as a blade runner in 2019. Blade runners are the police that specialize in hunting and eliminating android look-alikes of humans known as Replicants. Four replicants have escaped from an off-world colony and have come back to Earth and Deckard is tasked with eliminating them. Since replicants are perfect copies of humans, hunting them down is a very difficult process. This makes the audience question which characters are human and which are replicant. The film follows a police mystery narrative where the protagonist has to track down the bad guys using evidence and intellect. We follow Deckard along as he travels around 2019 Los Angeles trying to find each individual replicant. The biggest problem with the film is its pacing. It is very slow at setting up the story and keeping the mystery alive. It feels much longer than its 117-minute runtime. The film speeds to a medium pace once Deckard finds his first Replicant, but it's too little too late. Having a slow film allows Scott to build a world around Deckard's story. Every detail and supporting fact has its own backstory and is open to more exploration. I expect Denis Villeneuve's sequel to dive further and revisit the same questions. The most important element of the film is its ability to raise valuable and complex questions about humanity. We know exactly which characters are replicants, but we never know the background stories of the human characters. We just assume they're human, but never really know who they are and their motivations. Having these questions distances the film from other sci-fi films of the 80's. It feels that this film was intended for people tired of the usual sci-fi films that follow Star Wars model where the characters are either good or evil and the audience is kept entertained with action and adventure. Scott has taken that trope and flipped it the other way around, creating a dark, dystopian film where every character has different questionable personal motives and isn't labeled as good or evil. The biggest aspect of the film is the technical work behind the scenes that make the world feel more real and lively. The visual effects are masterful for the time period and still look quite good thirty-five years later. The large urban setting completely surrounds the small characters and enhances the dystopian setting. Another minor problem with the film is the acting. Harrison Ford does an alright job as the hard and almost lifeless cop Rick Deckard. Rutger Hauer is the only highlight as the lead replicant, Roy. His character is never made into a clear villain and we end up feeling sorry for him as he searches for purpose in his short life. There is nothing special or memorable about the other characters.With the sequel, Blade Runner 2049, arriving next week, moviegoers should make it a mission to watch this to get a feel for what to expect. This is not the usual sci-fi action film that you most likely grew up on and I expect the sequel to follow that same trend.

Anyway she had never seen this film before so we both sat down and watched it together; afterwards she said exactly what I expected her to say \"how is that, one of the best films of all time?\"I truly can't believe how disappointing it actually is, maybe if it wasn't praised so much, therefore living up to an expectation, we could have enjoyed it more? I don't know. Harrison Ford was the most boring, uninteresting character I have ever laid my eyes on, there was nothing about him that grabbed me ever. He was just so stiff and generic, one of the dullest performances I've ever seen, and not only that, he basically rapes the replicant Rachael, that was actually very uncomfortable to watch, and made me hate him when I saw how he treated her, basically telling her what to feel, absolutely sick.Also was Deckard a replicant? I saw the final cut version each time I viewed the movie and it's never really felt to be explained, it's dropped in there slightly but not really touched on? Or was my attention drifting from boredom, I don't know.I've gotta say, I loved the movie Brazil, The Thing, Matrix, Dark City, 1984, and I felt like this was a bit of a mixture of movies like that, but one with a really lack of story, a lack of a moral message, no social commentary, I just couldn't find anything in it, I'm baffled as to how it's so praised.I will say the soundtrack was sometimes beautiful, the sets were done very well and are really immersive (especially when you take age into account) and it was certainly different from any other movie of it's sort. Also Ruther Hauer provided a legendary performance, it's a real shame how little of him is actually in the film, same goes for Daryl Hannah and the guy that made the little dummy things. It's for the reasons above I gave it a 6/10 (61/100).All in all, All the actors and actresses that played replicants, we're superb, especially Rutger.

It is based on the Philip K. Dick short story \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\". The film was distributed by Warner Brothers, being labeled as a Sci-Fi Crime Thriller. I have first seen the film over a year ago and will gladly document my opinions and observations for you.Blade Runner is set two years from now when androids are being used in off world colonies as workers. Four of them escape to Los Angeles and band together as an effort to increase their 4-year lifespan. It is up to Deckard (Ford) to investigate their whereabouts and confront them and along the way meet Rachael (Young).Every single character adds a lot to the coldness and darkness in the future world of Los Angeles. It is a serious film, but Roy Batty (Hauer) is both intimidating and charismatic as he always feels like a presence of death in every scene. Almost everyone else for the most part takes their part completely seriously. I love Blade Runner, plain and simple. The original score by Greek composer Vangelis is marvelous and worth listening to on it's own. The Set Design is gorgeous and completely paved the way cyberpunk media should look. The cinematography is also amazing, miniatures look real, and it subtly captures symbolism of scenes along with great dialogue. The themes of Blade Runner include Humanity, Philosophy, Genetics, and the Environment. One of the main forces of the film are testing people to see if they are human or replicant with the \"Voight-Kampff Test\". The effect of knowing is shown through Rachael who begins to cry that all her childhood memories are implants. Batty's speech about \"tears in rain\" really brings my emotional side out seeing as it is applicable to humans too and gives the character some redemption as well. Blade Runner didn't find it's audience in it's infancy, but it became the cult classic it is today. A sequel set in 2049 is coming out in October and I can't wait to go see it. Kids should wait and get older to see it to fully appreciate the film. Teens into film and Sci-Fi should love this and so should adults. This film has stood the test of time extremely well.

And even more ironically, the technical side of the filmmaking was the very quality that created the unique styles of the old sci-fi films. So, what makes these old films, Blade Runner in particular, so good looking compared to modern films, despite the fact that they had little technology back then? Speaking of visual style alone, what makes it so memorable compared to new films that are made with all the technological possibilities at filmmakers' disposal? There are three main answers to these questions:1. singular artistic vision as opposed to an army of graphic designers,2. director's own decisions as opposed to a director who does whatever he's told to,3. and lastly care and love in craftsmanship for the film by those who involved in making of it.Did you know that one of the buildings in Blade Runner was actually a kitchen sink? With all its miniatures and matte paintings the city looks gorgeous. Because people took their time to create it and they cared. It looks more real too than those created with CGI. And I know that uncanny valley effect is a term used for humans but I think it applies to objects as well. You can tell, most of the time, whether an object is physically there or it is a computer effect. CGI looks cheap. Blade Runner is like a hand-made classic European sports car whereas most modern films are like a Toyota Corolla, supposed to be better than the old ones but they are not, made out of plastic in an assembly line, and they look cheap.Another thing, other than the visuals, that makes this film so good is the soundtrack. Vangelis is one my favorite composers of all time. His style is unique and his music is so emotional. The soundtrack for Blade Runner perfectly fits and even helps create the ambiance of its universe. There are some films, like Jaws (1975) for example, that owe most of their success to their composers. I am not saying Blade Runner is one those films. Because it's visually and story-wise so good, It would still be a great film with different soundtrack, but at the same time, the soundtrack of Blade Runner is probably the best soundtrack for a movie ever, even though it didn't depend solely on its soundtrack for the mood.The story and acting are also very good. Though I must note that when I say acting, I mean Rutger Hauer's performance specifically. What a great performance from him. In fact, I wouldn't even bring up the acting in this film if it wasn't for Rutger Hauer. He totally steals this film. Harrison Ford is so mediocre most of the time and at times his acting gets even weird and bad. But in my opinion, this contrast of acting performances somewhat serves the film in a serendipitous way. We see how much there is to Roy, how a great character he is compared to Deckard, who looks like a mere policeman following orders with no depth to his personality. This brings me to the story of the film which is very simple in itself but brings up so many questions to the mind. Roy, an artificial human -a replicant as named in the film- seeking more life. As an agnostic person who suffers from death anxiety, I couldn't relate more to any movie character in my life than I relate to Roy. Don't we all suffer from fear of death, like Roy? I don't even know if I was created or not, as an agnostic. So I don't get to go after my creator, if there is such a thing, and ask for more life. But Roy has this chance and this is the plot of the film. But it is only incidental. For me, the film is all about the tragedy of being mortal. And by giving replicants a life span of only 4 years, we are reminded how short our own lives are. It is hard for us to realize somethings in life before an artist magnifies or reduces something so we can see it better. 4 years, 40 years, 80 years... In eternity, all those numbers lose their significance, as Roy put it more poetically ''...all those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain...''And then there is this fact about Roy that he is an artificial human, but his passion for life makes you think about what makes us alive and sentient. I remember this line from another film ''I, Robot (2004)'' it goes like this ''...When does a perceptual schematic become consciousness?...'' this is a very good question indeed. In fact, even for (organic) organisms, you can question the extent of their consciousness or for more simple life forms you can even think whether they are conscious at all. Or you can ask what makes us special and unique. Is it because we have souls? Or perhaps soul is something we made up and it is all about the chemicals that effect our decisions and the complexity comes from merely endless combinations and permutations of these chemicals. That idea makes you question your very own existence. The very fact that we have medication for depression tells us something about human mind. But we can speculate about these facts. I choose to accept that Roy is nothing less than a human in that matter.

Woody Allen, god rest his perv soul, made a great comment about 2001 that I relate totally with that movie and Blade Runner: the more times you watch it, the more you like it. I could go on and on. I need not write a thesis. With that said and like 2001, this movie would be lost without its soundtrack. Vangelis delivered on this like no other--except, maybe, Stanley Kubrick.

The same bleakly powerful message probably pervades both book and picture. The fact is, we are all replicants. The bitter truth is, we have no purpose, except to reproduce ourselves. Whether our life-span last 4, 40 or 140 years, it is as purposeless and pointless as if we were androids. Which we are. It doesn't matter what we have seen or experienced. We will pass and be forgotten, like the rest. It has been noticed that this film contains no families, or children. The need for that traditional, outdated method of self-replication has been eliminated, and people are simply duplicated, in different models, with variations. Memories are routinely fed into replicants, to convince them that they have reality, however spurious. If there ever was a creator, he was definitely killed, for his presumption. There is no doubt that, like everyone else, Deckard is a replicant. The film is frighteningly and permanently effective, for anyone who thinks about it, in every way. It's an image of our actual lives, here and now.Everything about Blade Runner is absolutely fabulous. It soars where the clunky and semi-literate Kubrick stumbles and fumbles.Now that I've read the book, and watched \"Dangerous Days\", I learn that Tyrell, the supposed creator, was merely another replicant, which simply confirms what I already believed.The performances are nonpareil.

People always told me it was a good film and worth watching. Having watched the film myself I can tell you these people are wrong. Blade Runner is a great film and you need to see it NOW!The film is gorgeous in every sense of the word. This film is very noir and reminds me of detective noir movies like the Big Sleep or the Maltese Falcon. As you can imagine the cinematography is perfect and the CGI for its time is pretty impressive. The CGI is almost akin to Star Wars IV in how good it looks.I love the scene in Tyrells office in the first 30 minutes of the film where Rachel is being interviewed. The use of colour and shadow in the office perfectly sets the tone for the interview between Rachel and Rick. The scene also illustrates why Ridley Scott is a great director. He is known in his movies for creating emotion trough darker surroundings and it's perfectly shown here. Ridley Scott has directed some brilliant movies like Alien, Thelma and Louise and Gladiator. However I think his best work has to be Blade Runner from a visual perspective alone.The music in this film is sublime. It is very synth heavy and perfectly captures the tone and theme of the film. In some parts the music is soft with just faint piano playing to give us a feeling of intimacy which works really well, especially for the scenes between Rick and Rachel. In other scenes we get a fast pace synth heavy track that compliments all the dynamic movement that the characters are doing in the scene. Vangelis knows what he is doing in movies and lends his skills as a composer expertly here. Hats off to you sir \"we are not worthy\"!!!! The plot itself was based off a 1968 novel by Philip K. Dick called \"Do androids dream of electric sheep?\" The film does not follow the book to the letter but the bare bones of the book are there and also the message behind it. The plot is a slow burner in places however there is a fundamental question posed to the audience. \"What makes something a human being?\" The replicants in the film look like people, act like people and die just like people. There comes a point where the androids in the film become more human than the humans are and they express real emotions that are very complex for androids to understand.The plot deals with mortality and the fear of death as well. The whole motivation for the escaped androids is that they do not want to die. Roy Batty goes after the \"cure\" to death and even goes so far as the meet his maker to try and stop death. When his creator says that escape from death is impossible Batty lashes out at first, and kills his creator and several others, however at the end of the film where he saves Rick Deckard from falling to his death he comes to some inner peace realising that death is inevitable. The plot of this film has so many interpretations and has been discussed so many times that it has taken on a life of its own. I even may have interpreted it differently to others however the fact of the matter is there is not right or wrong way that a film can make you feel, it is personal to you.The actors in this are brilliant. You can really tell that they gave a sh*t about the film and everyone brought their A game. Harrison Ford is great and gives one of the best performances of his career hands down! His scenes with Rachel where a high point as you could tell his infatuation was real and at the same time you saw Rick's torment as he realises Rachel is an android and not 100% human.Rutger Hauer is fantastic as Roy Batty and crosses the line between human and android so convincingly that whilst watching the film you see him become more human with every scene. The scene where his character dies actually makes you feel for a murderous android, and his line about his memories being \"lost in time, like tears in rain\" had a certain melancholy feeling to the scene. All I can say is that this film is brilliant in terms of plot, acting, music, looks and feel. The pacing is a little slow in parts, which meant I did lose concentration the first time I watched it, but not so much that it distracts from the film.

When I began the movie, I double checked to make sure it is indeed made in 1982, and not a modern remake. My concerns are not rootless: the movie has simply splendid visual effects that it is truly timeless. Every scene, and almost every frame, can be captured and analyzed as a award-winning photograph. The plot is also awesome. I would say the pacing of the first act feels weird, but as the movie goes on the tempo gets intense and plot works a lot better. Most characters feel real and I understand the motives behind them. It is not flawless, and several things felt quite clich\u00e9 and stupid. However, whatever troubles they might have, the character design works and it improves flow of the plot, unlike Star Wars A New Hope, which also stars Harris Ford, but gives everyone the laziest conceivable character.

Cut to the present and now perhaps my favorite film director, Denis Villeneuve, is making \"Blade Runner 2049\" for release this fall. As such, I gave the original \"Blade Runner\" another chance to see if I was perhaps \"missing something\" (it seems to be widely considered one of the best sci-fi flicks ever). While I now understand what the movie is \"supposed to be\", so to speak, I can also better articulate why it won't appeal to a certain viewing audience.For a basic plot summary, \"Blade Runner\" is set in 2019 Los Angeles, where the Tyrell (Joe Turkel) Corporation has begun making human replicant (or \"skin jobs\") cybernetic beings for slave labor in the \"Off-World\" colonies. Predictably, a group of these beings, led by Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), rebel and commandeer a vessel back to Earth, where they will wreak havoc if not dealt with. This is where Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) comes in, as he is the best in the business at dealing with these replicants. Along the way, Deckard comes across a new type of replicant, Rachael (Sean Young), that challenges him in ways not previously seen.There is no doubt that \"Blade Runner\" is based on a very interesting, pure science fiction concept: human consciousness in a machine body. There are thousands of stories that could be told on this topic, and many already have been across cinema. The trouble with \"Blade Runner\", though, is that it doesn't care all that much in digging into the meat-and-potatoes of those stories.Instead, this is a film primarily concocted out of love of noir and setting. Director Ridley Scott (much like he did in his earlier \"Alien\" effort) is vastly more interested in exploring the dark underbelly of a future LA than he is in crafting a really tight story. As such, much of \"Blade Runner\" showcases the aesthetics of the landscape. If you are really into that sort of thing, this movie will rocket up your list.For those more pulled in by story and character development, however, \"Blade Runner\" only gives out as many nuggets as it needs to in his department. In fact, most of the context of the entire picture is given in an opening text crawl. There are a few \"story moments\" scattered throughout the movie, but they are truly few and far between and too short to satisfy those looking for them.So, I think the litmus test of whether a viewer will enjoy \"Blade Runner\" comes down to how much you enjoy the noir/aesthetic of a film, as that is the film's primary purpose. Does it touch on some interesting ideas/characters? Yes. Does it explore them in any deeper fashion? Absolutely not.", "rating": 4, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 23, "votes": 39}, "heading": "Those Who Enjoy Deep Story/Character Flicks Need Not Apply", "date": "2017-08-03T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3771184"}, {"content": "I finally got around to watching this movie for the first time last night, after having it on my watchlist for years.

Rick Deckard is a \"blade runner\". Blade runners are hired to assassinate automatons known as \"replicants\". Rick Deckard is assigned to hunt and assassinate four replicants for their crimes. While on this hunt, Rick Deckard is confronted by a female replicant that makes him question himself. Nearing the end of Rick Deckard's journey of tracking down replicants, his perception is changing towards the autonomous beings and finds himself questioning humanity. The main theme of this film is texture/style. The futuristic Los Angeles in 2019 is portrayed as dystopian. There is a dark atmosphere that contrasts with vibrant colors and neon lights. The city is constantly raining and there is filth everywhere. Light is often beaming into darkness to make scenes more dynamic. Actor Harrison Ford is Rick Deckard, a retired cop that gets assigned to be a blade runner. Actor Sean Young is the replicant named Rachael that is a love interest for Rick Deckard and makes him question his views about the replicants. Rick Deckard and Rachael are two main characters that have an interesting relationship that evolves as the film goes on. Concepts about humans and engineered automatons made to resemble humans are expressed in the film. The concept of the autonomous replicants becoming so advanced that they are nearly indistinguishable from actual humans. At what point can the replicants live normal lives among humans and not be made to work for humans with a predetermined life span?The film is styled as a noir film with science fiction elements. Rick Deckard is doing detective work to find his suspects. In the beginning, there is an establishing shot overlooking the dark futuristic Los Angeles and a transition to an eye to symbolize the ever watch-full eye that gives the viewer a sense of the film. Lighting techniques are used to create the illuminated pupil's motif that is used often on replicants. Rain is another motif that continuously occurs throughout the film. Many medium close-up shots and close-up shots are used to display the actor's emotions or capturing the actor in dense areas of people. Like Star Wars, Blade Runner immerses you into a highly convincing world that brings out our imagination. The world of Blade Runner is created through mostly practical effects with little computer-generated imagery.

They are simply two lost, and confused beings that have found warmth together in the cold world - Who cant feel that?!!Add all the other layers, and of course the incredibly beautiful score by Vangelis, and you have one of the greatest films ever made.

In anticipation of that, I decided that I needed to see the original, which I hadn't seen in several decades (if not longer). Of course, when we talk about the original movie, what we really mean is the definitive \"Director's Cut\" that was released 10 years ago (to commemorate the 25th anniversary).\"Blade Runner: The Final Cut\" (117 min.) opens with the reminder that it is \"Los Angeles 2019\" (yes, only 2 years from now!), and we get the stunning introduction to what the City of Angels has become. It's not long before we are introduced to the Harrison Ford character, a guy who is running down \" human-like replicants\". Couple of thought on seeing this movie again after all this time: 1. \"Blade Runner\" is NOT an action movie (although there is some of that), but rather a neo-noir psychological drama and character study. It's no wonder that US audiences didn't warm up to the original release all that much, expecting a sci-fi action movie. yes, it's sci-fi, but there the comparison stops. 2. The movie's visuals and photography are stunning still, even after 35 years. 3. It is absolutely remarkable how much cigarette smoking takes place, throughout the entire movie no less. This is surely one thing that Ridley Scott got totally wrong. But on the other hand, his premonition of climate change (even though that term didn't exist yet in 1982) was in the right direction (and supposedly will be even more central in the 2049 sequel). 4. Scott's version of LA 2019 has it as a mostly Asian, Tokyo-reminding, city. 5. The soundtrack from Vangelis remains as majestic now as it was then. 6. Last but certainly not least, it's amazing to see the lead performers (Harrison Ford, Darryl Hannah, Sean Young, Rutger Hauer) so.... young!Bottom line: \"Blade Runner\" circa 1982 was far ahead of its time. Now in 2017, it feels a lot more 'contemporary'.

The test subject, Leon, shoots Holden after Holden asks about Leon's mother. Bryant wants Deckard to retire Leon and the other three replicants: Roy Batty, Zhora, and Pris. Deckard initially refuses, but after Bryant ambiguously threatens him, he reluctantly agrees.Deckard begins his investigation at the Tyrell Corporation to ensure that the test works on Nexus-6 models.

The making of Blade Runner was chaotic.The nature of the film changed several times before it even got made. Film staff and some cast dropped out. It nearly became a film noir with Dustin Hoffman as the lead. The two stars hated each other, and it was a box office flop when it first came out.The problem with films these days is that they are made by a board room of number cruncher's. A films success is based on box office takings, rather than anything of substance and virtuous accountability.Blade Runner has since made a profit. If it hadn't does that mean its a failure. NO.I can't help but think that part of the reason it was an initial flop was due to the interference of executives in the original release. The Directors cut and Final cut were what the film should of been 35 years ago.Phillip K Dick was a visionary. His books are not the easiest to turn into a film. I enjoyed Adjustment Bureau, yet just like Blade Runner originally, I hated the happy Hollywood ending. Im hoping for a darker directors cut where David and Elise future isn't to assured.I may be slightly biased as Blade Runner is one of my favourite films, but for the Directors Cut and the Final Cut everything just works perfectly together, like a Jigsaw.The tension between Harrison Ford and Sean Young is real, they hated each other. Vangelis was in his prime. The cinematography is stunning. Ridley Scott is one of the most influential directors going. I like that for the Final Cut, it was treated subtly. They didn't over do the CGI, Gloss and mastering.The scene where Deckard 'Retires' Zhora leaves you battling your conscience. A woman was basically murdered in cold blood. Shot in the back as she was running away. All in slow motion with the beautiful \"Blade Runner Blues\" summing the scene up, shining a light on the cold nature of the killing.When I saw the Directors cut, I was pleased that Ridley Scott was finally allowed to say a big Fu!! you to Hollywood. The daring nature that Deckard and Rachels fate is sealed. Living on borrowed time. As well as the ongoing questions. Is Deckard a Replicant ? Did Gaff let Rachel Live ? How long will they survive in the outside world ? Hollywood loves a happy ending. Ridely wasn't having that. As a director he is unapologetic. He hates the politics of Hollywood. He could finally discard the crap footage borrowed from the Shinning, in which we were expected to buy into the notion Rachel was different and built to survive, and they can live happily ever after.The unicorn scene in the directors cut, flips the film over and is the nail in the coffin to lets all dance into the sunset.The final sequence, when the elevator doors close on a forlorn Deckard and Rachel, and the thunderous baseline kicks in then all makes sense. What doesn't make sense is getting up the moment the film finishes and not staying to listen to Vangelis at his best.On a picky critical note: Some might say Deckard is supposed to be detective, but hardly does any investigating. Blade Runner isn't a detective murder mystery film. This is a film about humanity, empathy, equality, compassion, ethics.

As one of Britain's finest ever films, \"Blade Runner\" went from cult classic to an universally acknowledged masterpiece. It's probably the most visually dense film, with every frame brimming with detail and vitality, every bit of chiaroscuro adding to the film's melancholy mood. And it's one hell of a Cinema landmark, which at the same time, works as a blissful 'aide-m\u00e9moire'\u2014that some films just deserve a second freaking chance!At its initial release the film was a flop. To be fair, the theatrical cut of the film contained an unnecessary Harrison Ford voice-over as well as an ending that felt a bit too conventional for a film as bold as Blade Runner. Possible Reasons: It was the 80's and let's fact it, Ford wasn't exactly Robert De Niro who can god-smack the film's audience with just his narration skills and set the tone for it entirely. The rest of the blame can be given towards the studio executives whose moronic views, unnecessary edits and constant interfering almost ruined one of 80's most famous leading member of the Brit-pack: Ridley Scott's career. However, as Ridley began to work on a cut closer to his original vision and the film began to be seen by more and more people, it became considered one of the pinnacles of science fiction in film. For Ridley, this was extremely ambitious. Even today there's something about the scope and detail of the world that comes across as maddening and innovative. And the problem with ambitious creations is that not everyone is going to get it. While other Sci-Fi films from the same year (The Thing, Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial) offered film audiences heavy doses of suspense, action and adventure, Blade Runner is a film where characters espouse philosophical treatises while behaving strangely.Even to this day I'm astounded by how many people love this film given the fever-pitched insanity of the final act. Rutger Hauer howls like a wolf, taunts Harrison Ford in singsong, drives a nail through his hand and then gives one of the most iconic (and, if we're honest, indulgent) monologues in cinema. Even while I giddily enjoy the last few moments of the film, I sometime ask myself how so many people can end up loving something that is this esoteric and bizarre.The film is saturated in melancholy, overshadowed by death and peopled by ghosts. Visually and bionically, it is awash with haematological whispers.It shows a gritty, Noir-like, rain-soaked vision of a Dystopic future Los Angeles in which government sanctioned bounty-hunters (Blade Runners) are used to track down and \"retire\" human-looking robots known as Replicants. Loosely based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Philip K. Dick, director Ridley Scott's film is a complex, thought-provoking meditation on what it means to be human. With its striking visual imagery, moody soundtrack and advanced special- effects, Blade Runner is that rare Science Fiction movie that spends as much time setting a mood as it does discussing its big ideas. And while it may not be as exciting or revolutionary as more action-oriented movies like Star Wars or The Matrix, its cerebral nature and thematic ambiguity is what has made it a cult classic and landed it atop many critics lists of the top Science Fiction movies of all time. Most Film Directors, who have finished a Science-Fiction film, tend to choose something a little more down to earth for their next project. Ridley, coming off with the Academy Award winning \u2014 \"Alien (1979)\" \u2014 launched himself into something even more stylised and visually dense: \"Blade Runner (1982)\" \u2014 Hailed for its production design, depicting a \"retrofitted\" future, it remains a leading example of the Neo-Noir genre. Although the film under-performed in North American theatres, but has since become a cult classic. It's a movie that announces its impending awesomeness with authority. And style.

Firstly, it is visually stunning. The detail, the grit, the imagination of this film are all brilliant. I watched this movie for the first time in 2017, and watching it through modern eyes, I can say that the visual image of this movie has not aged. It still looks like a movie that could've been made today.I love the universe. I think its a great setting for some great story telling, and there could be so many more stories told in this universe. The context of the movie is great. A lawman, who hunts robots who looks like humans. I think this movie could've quite possibly influenced one of my all time favourite movies, The Terminator. The problem I have with this movie though, is in the story-telling. As great and imaginative as the universe and the context are, it was just a poorly written story. I get that it was 1982, and the version I watched was the Directors Cut, not the theatrical release, but even the 70s had well told stories. The movie started out strong, with Harrison being given a mission, and explaining how the test works. But about 25 minutes into the movie, it just gets really boring, and doesn't really pick up again until the last 25 minutes. Sure, there are some moments in the movie that make you sit up and pay attention again, like that weird guy who makes his \"friends\", and the part where Harrison Ford rapes a robot, and it falls in love with him, while looking oddly like he just drown, then came back life, with his blue lips and a wincing looking on his face.Over all, I don't think its a bad movie, it just has a boring story. I could watch it again, and maybe next time I'll watch the theatrical release, to see if some of the bullsh*t is cut out.

The world of Blade Runner looks incredibly atmospheric and it's totally convincing: Dark, lived in, gritty, dirty, mysterious, hostile. I wish modern movies would be more like this - not CGI built worlds that feel sterile and are forgettable! The two weaknesses of this movie are the slow pacing and Ford's performance. I'll elaborate in a second. Even if you consider it to be a thriller, the few action scenes only drive the movie slowly and tension is not built up as focused as in Scott's Alien. The movie takes almost 2 hours but we learn almost nothing about the characters. Some might argue this is OK since the replicants don't have the past like humans and also miserable Deckard (even if you don't subscribe to Scott's claim that he was intended to be a replicant) lacks a bit of humanity.It is worth noting that your viewing experience might suffer from picking a \"bad\" version of the movie. There seems to be a consensus that the Final Cut is probably the best choice. On paper the voice-over of Harrison Ford might have been a good idea as it could clear some confusions of viewers and also it gives the movie another film noir touch. But allegedly Ford disagreed and tried to intentionally sabotage the decision with a horrible voice-over performance. Apart from that Harrison Ford is not bad in this movie but not great either.

When they decided to act against humans, people called blade runners were hired to hunt down and destroy them. Rick Deckard, a former blade runner, is called back into action to take down a few robots before they can kill anyone else. The movie manages to pull off some fantastic practical effects. Everything looks real and unique, reason being it is. And it's awesome. I've always loved practical effects more than CGI, and here is no exception. The set designs are fantastic too. The world the movie builds looks great and feels authentic to an extent. It's immersive and interesting, and it's one I can't wait to continue to explore in Blade Runner 2049. Other than those technicalities, this movie sucks. For starters, the writing is terrible. The dialogue is generic and uninteresting, and the characters are the same. The first hour of the movie is consumed by literally nothing. I don't remember a single thing that happened. Deckard wasn't even looking for the robots, he was just kind of wandering around while the robots did the same. Then the last hour is just a rushed, forced, jumbled mess where so little intrigues that it almost gets boring. And to top it off, two characters end up in a relationship that is built around intimidation and two meet- ups, whereupon by the end we as the audience are expected to believe that they are in love. It just doesn't make sense. The climax is particularly bad. It seems to resemble Japanese anime in how completely weird and nonsensical it is. We've all seen it, live action anime doesn't work. 9/10 times anyway, and here isn't an exception. And even when it reaches it's end, there's no tension, no excitement, nothing. In fact, the movie becomes incredibly boring, and every second couldn't be longer. As a whole the movie is just super generic. The way in which Deckard ends up in this job is generic, the romantic aspect is generic. There's nothing new here. Overall Blade Runner is a huge disappointment. Sure, it looked pretty, but the first hour is literally nothing, the writing is uninteresting and the movie as a whole proves to be the same.

I was fixated on the beauty that was in front of me. It felt as if I was transported into the film itself; transported to the concrete jungle of 2019 Los Angeles. Hover cars flew past me, and I realized that I was crying a little bit. How could this movie bring tears to my eyes in the first 5 minutes? The movie Blade Runner, directed by Ridley Scott, is a piece of art. The film made me rethink what a movie experience should be. A good science fiction film should transport you into the world of the film. It should make you feel like you are a part of the action. What makes Blade Runner so special is that not only does it transport you to the urban sprawl of a future world, but it makes you forget about your real life on earth. At the end of the movie, I felt a bit out of place. I longed for the vast city and hauntingly beautiful world of the movie. I was a different person walking out of the theatre, my mind racing and my heart throbbing from the achingly beautiful soundtrack and stellar performances. This is what a movie should be. Action packed, a meaningful story, and a soundtrack that complements the film in a unique and magnificent way. A film that makes you question what it means to be human, Blade Runner, directed by Ridley Scott, is one of the best movies of all time due to the dazzling visuals and soundtrack, a meaningful and deep storyline, and superb acting throughout. A few words come to my mind when I think of the Blade Runner soundtrack. Mysterious beauty would perfectly describe it. The soundtrack is something I have never experienced before. A mix of space adventure, and romantic mysticism, the soundtrack gave me goosebumps all over my body and emotions flooded over me like a tidal wave. Composed by Grammy Award Winning musician, Vangelis, the soundtrack complements the film in a powerful way. During each scene, the music works with the cinematography, feeling almost like a trippy music video. In many films, the soundtrack overpowers the movie, or vice versa. In Blade Runner, there is a perfect balance between the two. Blade Runner's soundtrack is superb, but doesn't even compare to the brilliant visual effects that were ahead of its time. The incredible thing about Blade Runner is that no cgi was used throughout the whole film, it wasn't invented yet. The special effects team used matte paintings, different lighting techniques, and miniature models to depict the dark future world of dystopian Los Angeles. When I heard this myself I was baffled. The amount of time and work put into this film is truly amazing and unbelievable. Many shots include fly-overs of the whole city, every detail in the buildings and even on the street hundreds of feet below are emphasized and included. The artists department was not lacking in detail here. With architectural interior designs by the iconic, Frank Lloyd Wright, the world in Blade Runner is symmetrical and beautiful. Combining classic 80s technology and ideas into a dystopian, futuristic style, works very well and is captivating when on the big screen. I found myself generating an obsession with the architecture and design in the movie, it changed the way I see the world around me. As a photographer, it has influenced my style and I see through the camera lens in a kind of \"Blade Runner filter\". Another fascinating thing about the visuals was the cinematography and set design. Each shot in Blade Runner could be its own work of art. The film moves at a slow pace, without boring you out. Each shot is carefully framed and there is a huge focus on portrait shots and facial features. There is a particular moment in the movie that I think is the most beautiful thing I have seen in a film. Deckard is standing inside of his apartment, while the lights from the many drone blimps in the bustling city shine through the closed blinds. The shot is powerful and really gives the audience the feeling of actually living in such a world. On top of the groundbreaking visuals and untraditional storyline, performances by Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer really make the film believable and noteworthy. A quality that makes someone a great actor, is if they can truly transform themselves, believably, into that character. Amazingly, in Blade Runner, every actor and actress successfully achieves this feat. When an actor has to pretend like he or she is a man made robot, it is far from easy. Rutger Hauer, who plays an escaped replicant, Roy Batty, has many excellent and timeless monologues in the film. His famous \"tears in rain\" monologue can be considered one of the best acting performances of all time. Harrison Ford, playing Rick Deckard, has to play a cop trained to kill, or retire, escaped robot replicants. Throughout the movie, he had to act in such a way where the audience couldn't tell if he was a robot or a human. This is what makes great acting. The performances done by these actors are unforgettable and make the film much stronger. In conclusion, Blade Runner is a must see film for people that love movies with deeper meanings, and for the beauty and cinematography. I would not recommend this movie, however, for the average movie goer. This film is not just a futuristic action movie, it is an artistic experience that leaves you on a higher level of human thought after seeing it. Blade Runner is one of the best movies of all time because of its dazzling visuals and soundtrack, a unique and intriguing storyline, and superb acting.

On one hand, it depicts powerful concepts, but on the other hand as a film lacks quite a bit in terms of pace and content. So basically put, its narrative is greater than its own self. The film is a much, much lesser effort than the themes it depicts.Young Harrison Ford does alright, while Hauer (the villain) is decent as well but so much of this film is in the things it hints at rather than the things it actually actively does. Just Hauer himself is more a compelling character on an aesthetic level really.The scenery is superb in places, really very impressive stuff visually for a 1982 production. But as so often with Ridley Scott sci-fi's, we're given a lot of arty stuff, of the rarest more sophisticated kind, along with very deep philosophical themes... but his films seem to always have that discrepancy in pacing and in actually developing those themes. This film borders on the genius in what it scratches on, but never achieves that genius because of how linear the scenes are, how excessively paced down the development occurs, and simply, how much the film focuses on all other things but those philosophical themes.If you'd catch that film at any random point and watch on, you'd never think it was anything more than one of those hot crime type scifi's from the 80's. It's only towards the end we're revealed all the depth that was supposedly hiding in this work. But it's too late by then. A film with such conceptual density needs to, while still maintaining subtlety in execution, make it clear what it's about. Instead, we're really given a succession of scenes with little actual value in themselves: a common, linear body of sequences with ordinary, underwhelming events happening. The fight scenes are long and often in bad taste, most scenes are in themselves totally forgettable, and what really is praised in this one is the narrative and philosophical implications from the very end, so not the film itself but what it talks about.So that's watching a full two hours of very ordinary, highly paced sci-fi, for just the one powerful scene at the end with the big quotes and all the poetry. It's totally underwhelming in light of what's put in the works. An artisan/craftsman needs to make his works shine and highlight its most precious qualities, not conceal or smother them while other aspects completely dominate the equation.As trivia, this is a film that's influenced the band Fear Factory enormously, the band quoting many moments like: \"I want more life - it's too bad she won't live... but then again who does - that's what it is to be slaved\"... and one must pay tribute to the use of the then very modern synth-based atmospheric soundtrack and how it mixes so well with the blueish/metallic overtone on the visuals, with the rain at the end and that poetic, genuinely deep moment. \"Our memories, like tears in the rain\".As an ultimate philosophical ideal, this film is profoundly nihilistic. It's clearly saying man and machine are virtually the same thing so long as they are merely as intelligent, so long as they are sentient beings with memories. So no place for the soul, or a god. Organic=artificial, and there's no profound meaning to life.The other thing is this film has an interesting twist, but again, does little in the way of clarity there.A sympathy 7/10.", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Aesthetically powerful, slow philosophical Sci-Fi", "date": "2017-02-15T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3640281"}, {"content": "Wow, that was one of the most insane movies I have ever seen in my entire life.

How people will give up integrity and stop with the search of wisdom for wits and how to take advantage of others for their own benefits. This film might come off pretentious to some audiences with it's visuals and style of it. But I thought the visuals and style of it actually compliments the intellectual aspects of this film. Even if it lacks in dialogue, the visuals really does bring about the grim and dark reality of the future. This isn't a film that I would watch over and over again. But for it's rare watch for me, it's stunning and psychotic when it comes to the characters and the dystopian setting. Harrison Ford was the it adventure and sci-fi adventure guy in the 70's and 80's. And he was almost the perfect choice to play an ex-police officer Rick Deckard. His job as a \"Blade Runner\" is to track down and hunt for replicants, basically human clones used to serve in the colonies outside Earth. They have a very short life span and is thought of as disposable and expendable by the humans. Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) is a intimidating, manipulative and violent character that I have a lot of sympathy for. He is a character that is portrayed as a villain because of the setting and situation. And yet Roy Batty is a character that just about anyone can have understanding and empathy towards. Ridley Scott tried to emulate certain aspects of \"Blade Runner\" into his few other films such as \"Prometheus\". Other artists, directors and even video gamer designers took elements from this movie. Hideo Kojima being one of them when it came to his work in \"Snatcher\" was inspired and influenced by this film.

It has, despite its age, a tremendous visceral impact, especially if you can see it on a big screen in the dark. The final cut of this film is definitely the best version of this Ridley Scott classic. The plot mainly focuses on ideas and how the key characters in the film deal with the situation they find themselves in. The actors playing the genetically engineered human replicants all give original, fresh, unusual yet convincing performances in their roles, led by the strong and committed central performance of Rutger Hauer is Rory Batty. The journey these replicants are on plays alongside a separate journey of another Replicant Rachel (well played by Sean Young) as a company owned experimental model that, by using human memory implants, is convinced she is a human until forced to question her existence by an interrogation by human detective Deckard. Deckard is played in a surprisingly low key and introspective performance by Harrison Ford. How the Deckard character interacts with Rachel, while he attempts to track down the group of replicants led by Hauer's character (their presence on earth is illegal) is very steadily paced, but interestingly and effectively executed as a dramatic police procedural story, including immersing you the viewer in a brilliantly realised environment of a highly polluted 2019 Los Angeles. While moving through the films plot, the focus is on the gradual climax of the procedural story within the context of looking how these intelligent, super-strong, but emotionally child like engineered humans go on their journey to confront their human creator (brilliantly played by Joe Turkel as a billionaire recluse) about the truth of the nature of their existence. Juxtaposed against this is Deckard's disillusioned and largely emotionless human gradually having his humanity re- awakened by the development of an increasingly romantic relationship with Rachel, as well and questioning himself as to whether there is in fact a difference between humans and replicants. These plots are embedded is an amazing visual experience, largely down to Scott's amazing vision and execution (despite some well publicised problems during shooting), but brilliantly supported in its realisation by cinematographer Jordan Crowenweth, visual effects supervisor Douglas Trumbull and his Entertainment Effects Group Company, editor Terry Rawlings, production designer Laurence Paul and the truly amazing score of Vangelis. The final cut rightly restores an appropriate ending fitting to the noir overtones of the film, the original cut released in 1982 suffered from an out of place narration and ending that was not in keeping with the tone of the rest of the film. It was surprising that ET beat this film to the visual effects Oscar, as in my opinion the work on this film was far more impactful and impressive.

The story takes place in a dystopian Los Angeles a couple decades in the future.The film's unique cinematography perfectly combines the neon and gadgets of the future with dark, looming architecture and lighting, making the marriage of sci-fi and noir feel natural where it could be cheesy. The dark yet futuristic score works hand-in-hand with the visuals creating just the right background for this unconventional story.Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford, who was born to play the typical hard-nosed noir detective) is a retired Blade Runner, a futuristic detective. They're a special division of police specifically hired to track down fugitive replicants (scientifically engineered humans).Deckard, who is forced to come out of retirement, must track down four dangerous replicant fugitives.While the movie would be great with just the first two ingredients of our cinematic blend (film noir and sci-fi), the third (philosophical fiction) is what makes it a true cinematic masterpiece. Believable performances from all cast members and great dialogue (some of which is completely improvised, hats off to Rutger Hauer) allow the movie's heavy themes to stand out where they could have been an afterthought. While Deckard hunts down replicants one by one, the definition of humanity becomes blurry to both Deckard and the audience. From beginning to end we are both entertained and provoked to thought.So watch it if you're a Sci-Fi fan. Watch it if you're a noir fan. Watch it if you're a philosophy fan. It's the combination of the three that has given Blade Runner a spot in the annals of cinema and in the hearts of movie lovers everywhere.", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Blade Runner Movie Review: Thoughtful Entertainment", "date": "2016-12-09T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3595387"}, {"content": "Ridley Scott has made a name for himself by mastering several different genres but he's always been at his most comfortable in Sci-Fi and Blade Runner is proof to this. Blade Runner is a masterpiece, it's completely flawless, there is not a single other film like this one despite many trying. The plot of the movie seems simple but in the end it's really a story about life itself and how you use yours not matter how long or short it may be. Harrison Ford was the perfect casting for the character of Rick Deckard he's fantastic in this movie he's perfect and being an experienced operative while also managing to come across as exposed when he meets Sean Youngs character and his arc gives the film a more personal touch. The design of the city of Los Angeles 2019 is absolutely incredible the special effects are seamless and it legitimately feels like it could happen one day. It's not a perfect future it's one full of crime and poverty but that's a good thing because it makes the film feel more real and less like a fantasy Utopia. Rutger Hauer was fabulous in this movie he's just the right amount of menacing without ever seeming over the top and his monologue towards the end of the film is just a marvel to watch and few times have my eyes been more glued to the screen that during this monologue. There aren't a whole lot of action sequences in this movie but when there are it's not only riveting but really intense Ridley Scott clearly carried over the techniques he used in Alien to maintain tension and it fits just right into this film. Like I said there aren't a whole lot of action sequences in this movie it's mostly dialogue and got some of the finest and most intriguing ever put to film every new scene forces you to think and reevaluated were you were in the last scene and demands and grips your attention. Ridley Scott is truly one of the finest directors ever he knows how to direct a movie he holds back and shows just enough to keep the viewers attention. A lot of the moments in this movie don't make a whole lot of sense but it's meant to be that way, we're meant to be wondering what the hell we just watched and force us to got back and watch it again.

The problem is that it never gets around to telling a good story. The story that is there is extremely drawn out, and depressing. It is a slow, boring, melodramatic movie that has very little humanity (which is part of the premise), and nothing for the viewer to care about. It's a pretentious, navel-gazing art house film dressed up as a sci-fi/film noir thriller. Vangelis's score is sometimes praised, but really not very good. Aside from a few good moments, he's mostly playing weak jazz and blues on synthesizers, or somber piano music. As science fiction, it's kind of interesting in retrospect to see what predictions it got right, and what it got wrong. In Blade Runner's 2019, smartphones and flat screen TVs have not been invented, but androids and flying cars have. The Terminator, which came out two years later and had a similar (but crucially different) concept, is a much better movie on almost every front, both as a story and as science fiction, although it had a smaller budget and less impressive visuals.It's not hard to see why Blade Runner flopped at the box office, despite the pedigree it had. Word of mouth could not have been good. The fact that it's been resurrected in critical estimation is entirely about the visual imagery it created, which was, to be fair, mind-blowing for the time and extremely influential on later films.

All the characters are well drawn out and you find yourself relating to the villains, as well as rooting for the main character.The acting in the film is mostly top notch. Harrison Ford gives a very memorable performance as Deckard; although he downplays the role, and Deckard isn't as enthusiastic compared to Indiana Jones or Han Solo, Ford nonetheless delivers a winning performance. Rutger Hauer gives a stand out performance as Roy Batty, the leader of the replicants, bringing a real aura of menace to the role, while keeping the human element. Daryl Hannah (who was unknown at the time) makes a splash \u2013 excuse the pun \u2013 as do the rest of the cast; however, Sean Young is not very good as Rachel, the love interest for Deckard. The romance scenes between these two, normally a highlight of any film, are the weakest part.The scenes in which Deckard hunts down the replicants are generally entertaining, and like all great films, the best part comes at the end, in which Deckard finally comes face to face with Batty. However, rather than the good guy finally getting the bad guy, Batty tells of his memories and then dies in front of Deckard. The whole scene is very moving and not what you were expecting.There's also the question as to whether Deckard is a replicant himself.

An outstanding, wonderful classic that has endured time and criticism. Ridley Scott has never reached this pinnacle in his career since, which is so unfortunate. He has a remarkable filmmaking talent like the greats of Stanley Kubrick and Orson Welles. Upon first full viewing of the film, I was drawn in by the visual effects and the narrative. As the credits rolled, I thought with teary eyes how could humanity be so cruel. The film leaves ambiguous questions that may or may not have answers; allowing philosophical speculation. Many films today give you answers, even if the answers are stupid. There is a book called \"Eyes Wide Open\", and in the book the author asks Kubrick what he thought about Spielberg's \"Schindler's List\" and the Holocaust. Kubrick replied, \"Schindler's List was about success. The Holocaust was about failure.\" \"Blade Runner\" does not romanticize the mainstream Hollywood formula of happy endings (or at least the Final/Directors Cut) and individuals, but instead focuses on major aspects of the society portrayed in the film. The acting in \"Blade Runner\" is superb, especially from the wonderful Rutger Hauer. Los Angeles is stunning thanks to visual effects designer Syd Mead and direction by Ridley Scott.

Upon evaluation, I feel there is much more I could add to this.This is my personal subjective and analysis of the film and the philosophical writings of Turing and Hume referenced below. Alan Turing gave his answer to the question of whether or not machines could ever be capable of thinking like a human being as a 'yes.' Many philosophers and great thinkers of history stated the answer would be, \"no.\" While it is often agreed that computers can think in certain but not all ways, it raises the question, \"how would we even know if a computer is thinking like a human being or not?\" Turing stated that it is polite to assume everybody thinks as the only person one can know positively thinks is one's self. With this in mind, it can be concluded that machines can one day be assumed to have human thought just as validly as any person besides one's self does. Turing looked at a party imitation game as an inspiration to develop the Turing Test, a game in which a judge must decipher if he is speaking to a computer or a person and if the computer can be mistaken to be human, it can be concluded to possibly have human-like thought. In the film, four bio-engineered humanoids \u2013 known as replicants \u2013 come to Earth illegally and become targets for execution. The process of replicant execution is referred to as retirement, perhaps because the layman would look at replicants as not humans, therefore their executions would not be considered genuine deaths. The film utilizes the fictional Voight-Kampff Test \u2013 a test parallel to the Turing Test designed to determine if someone is a replicant or not by asking a series of questions and looking closely at iris dilations and pupil fluctuations to decipher if their emotional response is not human. Towards the beginning of the film, the replicant character Leon is given the test with suspicion of him being a replicant. Before murdering the questionnaire, Leon responds to several questions in an evasive and curious human-like way easily, thus passing the Turing Test before the Voight-Kampff Test really began. The character Rachael believes herself to be human but is then given a the test by Deckard and is then discovered to be a replicant. The line between artificial intelligence and human intelligence becomes blurred, so much that only the slightest details would give away the difference. According to the film, artificial intelligent beings are in fact able to pass the Turing Test and therefore are able to think for themselves. With this in mind, mankind ever does create a machine that claims to be able to think and potentially turn away from initial programming, I believe we should not automatically assume they do not genuinely think, and possibly treat such a machine as a living organism. David Hume once wrote: \"As a memory alone acquaints us with the continuance and extent of this succession of perceptions, 'tis to be considered, upon that account chiefly, as the source of personal identity. Had we no memory, we never shou'd have any notion of causation, nor onsequently the identity of our persons beyond our memory . . .\" and \". . . memory does not so much produce as discover personal identity, by shewing us the relation of cause and effect among our different perceptions.\" I interpret and summarize Hume's writings as stating memory is not what makes somebody a person as other philosophers may believe, but rather helps one know their personal identity. The character Racheal learns she not only is a replicant destined to die within a short amount of time, but that her memories had been programmed by her creator, Tyrell. Racheal essentially loses nearly all understanding of her personal identity but as she exists, she does not lose her personal identity altogether. While not officially stating it, the film hints that Deckard, is not only assigned to retire replicants, but also a replicant himself. This is further explored in The Final Cut in which Deckard dreams about a unicorn and at the end of the film finds an origami unicorn on the floor presumably left by his work partner, Gaff, who had previously been shown with an origami match-stick man. Towards the end of the film, Gaff tells Deckard that he has done a man's job while before treating him more unfairly, further suggesting Deckard may be a replicant. With this in mind, it appears Gaff not only knows Deckard's basic whereabouts and thoughts, but possibly created Deckard with programmed memories that may belong to Gaff. If this theory is true, Deckard's understanding of his personal identity is false, but his actual personal identity is not, as memories do not create personal identities but helps people understand their personal identity. The character Roy Batty, moments before death, says the following lines to Deckard: \"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time like tears in the rain Time to die...\" One could conclude with Hume's writings that Batty's memories are not what makes him a person but helps him understand his personal identity. With his memories gone, his understanding of personal identity would cease to exist, but by saving Deckard's life and sharing his memories, he allows his personal identity to continue existing as Deckard would remember him. As Batty dies, a dove he was holding is released and then flies into the air, suggesting his soul left his body and makes its way to Heaven. As his personal identity lives on and despite being artificial, he is in fact a person.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 5}, "heading": "Philosophical Analysis (abridged class paper)", "date": "2016-05-31T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3479576"}, {"content": "I will give a simple review and opinion if you thinking to watch it or not.My opinion : Its up to you whether to watch it or not.For me, nothing special about the movie and sometime its boring.

When this based on Philip K. Dick's novel titled \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" film opened in cinemas in 1982 it was criticised for its slow-paced tempo and \"chaotic plot\". Today it is often listed as the most important and original movie of the genre along with such masterpieces as \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" by a titan film director Stanley Kubrick and Andrei Tarkovsky's \"Solaris\". But does it really deserve the credit it gets nowadays? Action of \"Blade Runner\" takes place in 2019, in futuristic Los Angeles. The movie follows a story of Rick Deckard (played by Harrison Ford) - retired blade runner, a man who took care of replicants (superior forms of androids, they are human look-alikes with programmed feelings, but are much stronger physically) if they started causing troubles. Unfortunately for him, he gets an offer he can't refuse and is forced to take up his very last job and solve a problem of an artificial intelligent rebellious gang with their leader Roy Batty (breath-taking role of Rutger Hauer) ahead.Director Ridley Scott adapts Dick's vision on screen with a great passion. Thanks to Jordan Cronenweth's amazing photography, the streets of Los Angeles are dark and climatic. The depressive, somehow melancholic mood is additionally built up by the music soundtrack by a Greek composer \u2013 Vangelis (also known from his works on \"Chariots of Fire\" and \"1492: Conquest of Paradise\"). Surely, it is the technical aspects that develop the remarkable atmosphere, but \"Blade Runner\" is not a great film only thanks to them. The main advantage of the flick is a fantastic script. Screenwriters Hampton Fancher and David Webb Peoples deliver an A-class writing. They say a lot, but also keep the plot minimalistic and enigmatic. Of course, they also ask some poetical questions (in the spirit of the original story) about a meaning of humanity and emotions but keep it unpretentious and fun to watch for a common viewer. Also the acting is great (as I mentioned beneath). Harrison Ford and Sean Young (portraying android Rachel \u2013 femme fatale of the film) show some real skills, but the real icing on the cake of the cast is Rutger Hauer. He played his role of a savage and violent, but deep inside emotional and sensitive replicant so well, I can without exaggerating say that it is one of the best antagonist roles in history.\"Blade Runner\" is without doubt one of my favourite films.

Dick is a film with a reputation that grew following its trouble history with its studio. The debacle started with Scott facing studio interference that lead to re-edits that neither him or lead star Harrison Ford were satisfied with, especially with its dour performance at the box office. The ordeal was followed with re-edits that made their way into the Director's Cut Edition released on home media ten years later. However, it wasn't until Scott polished with the film with a final makeover, renovating the picture to his most satisfying form known as the Final Cut in 2007. What comes of the final product is a stylish futuristic sci-fi piece showing the director operating at arguably his finest fashion. Scorching with a dazzlingly rich visual heft and narrative that breathes a chock load of ambition. It is blistering sci-fi spectacle blooming with elements that have carried influence on many cyberbunk entries in later years including 'Dark City', 'Ghost in The Shell', and 'The Matrix' to name of few. Now that is a definition of a groundbreaking picture. Harrison Ford plays Rick Deckard, a local police officer in the futuristic city of Los Angeles in 2019, a city rattled by crime and economic depression. Deckerd is assigned to a daunting task of assassinating four emotionless androids known as Replicants. These otherworldly beings are humanoids who are disguised as regular humans. And the worst part, they happen to be responsible for the theft a spaceship. When he closes in the leader of the group Rachael (played by Seana Young), the only one born with emotion, Deckerd begins to question his identity. In age when science-fiction was the household for mainly aliens, intergalactic warfare, and post-apocalyptic settings; Blade Runner offered something not entirely seminal but highly underpopulated in the genre, and expanded upon it with ideas not many, if any, filmmakers dared to attempt before. This is where the visionary mind of Ridley Scott is poured into with no restraint of ambition. Set in a futuristic society completed with an eye-dazzling visual design that many (especially back in the day of its initial release) could describe as groundbreaking, the film transpires with a plot stitched together with a plethora of twists and turns that leave audiences' head throbbing with questions of Deckard's identity. Is he the man he always believed he is, or is there a secret hidden within his transparent being? As the events unfold into a steadily paced game of cat-and-mouse with sudden bursts of intense gunplay, conspiracy permeates the grim atmosphere to the point where the most intriguing elements lie not within the questions that are answered but the ones that are left unanswered. The story, uprooted marvelously from the script by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, is handled with grace and moves at pace that may prove to be too sluggish for some, but nonetheless allows the for the characters to build and for the plot to bulk up for the cutthroat climax. If you grab a hold of the Final Cut edition, you avoid the unnecessary Harrison Ford narration that bears seemingly no significant purpose. And as for Ford, fresh from his debut in the 'Indiana Jones' franchise', the actor puts on a performance that is more than desirable. There is a fair steam of charisma smoking through his performance. Sean Young remains solid in her role, but nothing that knocks for sheer impression. She just does enough to show she is talented and fitting for the role. Blade Runner is a profoundly engaging cyberpunk piece that broke many grounds for establishing powerful elements that have inspired many entries of the genre today.

The atmosphere is wonderfully consistent and really draws you in. As with Ridley Scott films in general the camera work and visuals are superb (the scene where Deckard runs a VoidCom test on Sean Young's replicant, and the window gradually turns opaque springs to mind). The effects still look great, remarkable considering the film is now more than twenty years old.The film looks better than ever here, with the re-mastered picture and sound quality and the very subtle use of CGI to clear up things like out-of-sync dialog, support wires on the spinners and the obvious stunt-double for Joanna Cassidy's character Zhora; all helping to maintain the endless feeling of plausibility that the world of Blade Runner presents. The only new addition that seemed slightly strange to me was in clearing up the original confusion as to how many replicants were actually missing. Much of the film's mystique revolves around the central question as to whether or not Deckard is, in fact, a replicant; a theory that initially came about due to a dubbing error during Deckard's briefing with Captain Bryant. Given that Scott has been one of the most vocal supporters of this theory, it seems odd to me that he would correct this line of dialog in such a way that destroys any real mystery surrounding the \"Deckard as replicant\" debate. There are so many layers to Blade Runner and so many things that can be said from the brilliant look of the newly restored cut, the awesome remixed sound, the Original Score by Vangelis, and the story itself. Without question, Blade Runner is a significant work of science-fiction cinema that manages to overcome any such flaws in character or narrative to take us on a trip into a world far beyond anything we've ever seen before.Overall rating: 10 out of 10.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 2}, "heading": "\"All those moments will be lost in time like tears in rain\"", "date": "2016-05-13T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3468926"}, {"content": "As it turns out, it dawned on me that I had never seen Ridley Scott's Neo-Noir Blade Runner despite the fact that it it a critically acclaimed film and highly regarded by many of my contemporaries. I have found that sometimes you have seen clips, heard people reference it, and simply hear the title so much that you think you have seen it. Then you realize that you're familiar with the ideas, concept, or story but not the movie itself. When watching a movie from 30+ years ago, I do my best to place myself in the shoes of the audience then. But, I am having difficulty this time. As a peer-reviewed cinema researcher, I believe that no matter how old a film is that it should still be relevant and impact audiences many decades down the road. Truthfully, I am not entirely seeing why it is such a regarded film still to this day. However, it is definitely an artistic masterpiece due to the technical elements of the production. So in many ways, yes, it still IS an iconic visionary masterpiece; but, fails to connect or resonate with audiences today.It doesn't take long to understand that this film is a neo-noir detective movie that takes place in a dystopian future. Neo-noir is regarded as a film noir style movie produced after the classic film noir period (which was relatively short ~1940s-50s). This genre (although, technically, there is sufficient evidence to suggest that film noir is more of a style not a true genre) follows many of the same tropes and elements found in film noir (think Billy Wilder's Sunset Blvd, Double Indemnity, classic detective movies, or Orson Welles). Often, the protagonist is a solitary individual who finds him or herself in over his or her head who faces or exhibits perpetual pessimism, fatality, or menace in a plot consisting of cynical attitudes and sexual motivations. From a technical perspective, film noir (or neo-noir) is stylistically dark, high contrast, low key lighting, contains strategic shadows, and shots filled with symbolism and dichotomy. The plots are usually slow burning and contain social commentary or a self-reflexive narrative. Once analyzing this movie as a neo-noir, it becomes more fascinating but still lacks that timelessness that can be found in some of the examples mentioned earlier in this paragraph. As a artistic film, I am impressed with the vision of Ridley Scott. As a classically-regarded and praised film, I am not very impressed. Although, I find that it is an excellent example of how many in the early 1980s viewed the future and that is is a fantastic example of neo-noir style filmmaking.One of the biggest problems I had with the film is the fact that I had trouble loving the protagonist or hating the antagonist, or feeling sympathy for either of the aforementioned. In screen writing, it is imperative that the audience make a firm connection with either the protagonist or the antagonist. Note: the antagonist in a film/neo-noir is not always the \"bad guy.\" Whereas even Gloria Swanson's Norma Desmond in Sunset Blvd made a strong connection with the audience in that we feel great sympathy for her plight, yet she is the antagonist in the story\u2013or many agree as such. Harrison Ford's Deckard in Blade Runner never quite garnered strong support from me in the same way his nemesis Roy failed to elicit disdain. Both Deckard and Roy are fairly static characters\u2013meaning they lack dynamic development. There is, however, an indirect glimmer of character development in Roy at the very end that plays significantly into the plot for a brief but strategic moment. As regularly reoccurring throughout the narrative the character of Rachael is, she can almost be removed from the film and change little in the overarching story. For the most part, she simply exists and pays into Deckard's motivation, but mildly so. She neither causes him to view Replicants differently or becomes his sole goal. It is clear from early on in the plot that Deckard already had reservations in retiring Replicants. Rachael simply amplifies or intensifies the feelings that were already brewing.Looking back at movies from the mid to late 20th century that take place in the early to mid 21st century can be quite entertaining. Sometimes the future portrayed in the film, in one form or another, has actually come to pass. Although, other times, the future is incredibly inaccurate. The dystopian Los Angeles in Blade Runner is definitely the latter. Yes, there are themes of unchecked immigration, authoritarian power, and capitalism that can be read as not so different from today; but, for all intents and purposes, the future is much more grim in the movie than in today's reality. Perhaps that's why it can be difficult to connect with this movie. It takes place in a \"future\" that never happened, and probably won't happen in the now near future. I think that's the danger when writing or directing a movie set in a future that relies heavily upon technology directly related to the plot. Some movies can pull it off. Take Back to the Future for instance. It works because the technology in the culture of the future isn't significantly integrated into the essence of the plot or are solely responsible for some dystopian world. The futuristic technology merely exists and helps to move the plot along. In Blade Runner, the whole reason for the plot is because futuristic technology in our present day has turned on its creators and became the catalyst for a world drowning in chaos.If you have never seen Ridley Scott's Blade Runner, I definitely encourage you to do so, especially if you enjoy film or neo-noir movies.

Ridley Scott's follow up to the critical and commercial darling that was Alien, was by and large considered a flop and damned for not being a science fiction action blockbuster. There was of course some fans who recognised its many many strengths during the initial weeks of its 1982 release, but many who now claim to have loved it back then are surely looking sheepishly in the mirror these days, for the hard-core minority of 82 fans remember it very differently.Remember the spider that lived outside your window? Orange body, green legs. Watched her build a web all summer, then one day there's a big egg in it. The egg hatched... Anyway, that's by the by, the point being that a film can sometimes be ahead of its time, misunderstood or miss-marketed, Scott's masterpiece is one such case. Story, adapted in fashion from Philip K. Dick's story, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Is pretty simple. It's a dystopian Los Angeles, 2019, and there are four genetically engineered Replicants - human in appearance - in the city, which is illegal. They were designed to work on off-world colonies, any Replicant who defies the rules will be retired by special police assassins known as Blade Runners, and Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is on this case. A case that will prove to have many layers...A new life awaits you in the Off-world colonies! A chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure! Ridley Scott gets to have all his cakes to eat here, managing to blend intriguing science fiction with film noir. That the visuals are outstanding is a given, even the film's most hardest critics grudgingly acknowledge this to be an eye popping piece of visual class - the mention of eyes is on purpose since it's forms a key narrative thread. That it is awash with eye orgasms has led to critics calling a charge of beauty over substance, but the deep themes at work here tickle the brain and gnaw away at the senses.Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is to be a slave. Mood is set at perpetually bleak, a classic film noir trait, and paced accordingly. Scott isn't here to perk anyone up, he's here to ask questions whilst filtering his main characters through a prism of techno decay, of humanity questioned to the max, for a film so stunning in visuals, it's surprisingly nightmarish at its core. The emotional spine is ever present, troubled when violence shows its hand, but it's there posing an intriguing question as the Replicants kill because they want to live. And this as our antagonist, Deckard (Ford a brilliantly miserable Marlowe clone), starts to fall for Rachael (a sensually effective femme fatale portrayal), one of his retirement targets.Tears in the Rain.As Rutger Hauer (never better) saunters more prominently into the story as head Replicant Roy Batty, the pic evolves still more. Haunting lyricism starts pulsing away in conjunction with Vangelis' rib shaking techno score, while Jordan Cronenweth's cinematography brings Scott's masterful visions to life, key characters one and all. Visuals, aural splendour and dark thematics - so just what does it mean to be human? - Indeed, curl as one in a magnificent cinematic achievement. A number of cuts of the film are out there, and all of them have fans, but Scott's Final Cut is the one where he had total artistic control, and the scrub up job across the board is quite literally breath taking. 10/10", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 5}, "heading": "Retirement - Replicants - Resplendent.", "date": "2016-03-19T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3434356"}, {"content": "This film is my favorite film of all time (and for the record on my birth year), based on one of my favorite books of all time by one of my favorite author's Philip K Dick. The film also had a universal appeal as it has inspired lots of TV shows (Ghost in the Shell, Batman Beyond, Exo Squad, Phantom 2040, Battlestar Galatica, etc.) and other things. But also changed the way we saw sci-fi, showing how much more it can be.The production value is just fantastic because it's all practically. The city landscape is just awe inspiring along with the cinematography of it. From the very beginning with the music, once we saw that city I knew we've been transported to the future and I just didn't want to leave as there is just so much to see and take in. From the hover cars (still wonder about the traffic laws in air traffic), the big flat screen displays, the scanner screen in which you can speak out coordinates for the screen to zoom in. I really like the use of the lighting, from the amount of grit and darkness making the world not just feel accessible but also giving the film the noir feel. The futuristic city feels plausible and I personally feel with some of the technology we have now we're starting to get very close.Music score is just beautiful, I love how it's orchastratic but also a bit of techno beat which sort of fits the film and the world that it's in.But I just really love the story it is so rich with content that it would literally take more than one watch just to uncover more. It's not so much just a simple detective story but really just like most to all of Philp K Dick's works are really sort of an extensential philosophical meditation on the subjects like life and death as well as what is human? The characters are great, it's true not the deepest characters but sometimes characters we don't know too much about I find more interesting than ones we know everything about. And also what's really interesting is the fact that there are really any good guys and bad guys their all kinda in a gray area which was for it's time sort of rare.Richard Decard this is believe it or not my second favorite role from one of my favorite actors Harrison Ford, because the character he plays isn't really a hero but most of all human. He's a guy that is sort of broken and haunted by his career that he at first didn't choose to question until now, and just like the rain the guilt is weighing down on him and not stopping.In a way most of this film is really about Richard regaining his own sense of humanity. This guy was literally from my observations an all business type, it can be a really sad lifestyle because it's a rather two dimensional existence; it's simply a lifestyle but not really a life. We kind of see it from his apartment which doesn't really have much to anything, just some random stuff but no real sense of an identity.It's until Richard starts to have a relationship with the replicant Rachel, we see him become more balanced. I really like how it's handled, it feels realistic from the way they interact as we see both of them are trying to get a read on one another and warm up. I even like the Rachel has that look and mannerism like most women in the noir genre whom can be helpful but also carry a sense of mystery attached to them.Roy Batty is played well by another favorite actor of mine Ruger Hauwer whom is an antagonist (well sort of) that you actually sort of feel a sense of pathos for even sort of side with (I said sort of). Roy isn't a Replicant that wants to do take revenge on all mankind clich\u00e9. This is a guy that is trying to put more time in his biological clock.Some of the things he says are great, I really like it when he states and questions with slight frustration and fear why they weren't built to last. That's the kind of questions that we ask, whether were of a faith or not; and to this day still have no answer.There is an interesting dichotomous relationship between both the humans and the replicates. As we see most of the human have allowed themselves to be less human and the replicates are becoming a bit more human. However we also see the parallels between both human and Replicants, just as the Replicants are looking for more time to live but are also constantly fascinated in their experience with our culture is just like our own common struggle to live life to the fullest and also somehow give ourselves a few more years to live, so we can experience more.But also we find ourselves questioning things, I really like how there is this revolving notion on Richard Decard possibly being a Replicant and there are some suttle hints. Like one interesting moment was when we saw the eye lights on Richard for two seconds it's easy to miss. The thing is each of the Replicants all have one signature where their eye pupils have light. It sort of makes sense as to why he's so good at tracking Replicants down. I don't know whether Richard is a Replicant or not, I leave that for your own judgment but then again does it really matter.Decakard is searching for his human soul, just as we are searching for our own.Rating: 4 stars", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Soul Searching", "date": "2016-03-02T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3425329"}, {"content": "Probably the most overrated movie of all time!

It might have had to do with the fact that at the time I was expecting the magic and excitement of Star Wars (especially from a movie with Harrison Ford in it), and Blade Runner didn't quite measure up to that standard. Another plausible explanation for my then lukewarm response is that I simply found it painfully slow-paced and boring, and the dismal explanatory voice-overs made it virtually impossible to become immersed in the film.The 1992 director's cut completely changed my mind, partly because I had grown up and got accustomed to art movies by then and partly because it removed the unnecessary voice-overs, which resulted in a film with a totally different feel. The deeply elegiac story about the true meaning of humanity finally matched the gorgeous visual feast.Viewed strictly in its later incarnations (the director's cut and the 2007 'final cut' which is basically the same as the 1992 version with only minor alterations), Blade Runner is one of the greatest 'pure' SF films (not mixed with action/adventure or other genres) that has a solid place alongside such milestones as 2001: A Space Odyssey (1968), Solaris (1972) or A.I.

A group of replicants (robots who look like humans) from outside of Earth steal a spaceship to get to Earth to meet their creator and murder people. Then the police call a retired employee, Deckard a Blade Runner (A person who kills replicants) to kill the replicants. Why is it so moronic? Well, there are a series of plot holes: One plot hole is that there are said to be six replicants at first, but then for some reason even when none have been killed, it is said to be 4 with no explanation. There is also no reason for the replicants to be murdering a bunch of random people. Plus because of reasons that will spoil this film, wouldn't the geniuses that created the replicants build them so that they won't kill people and steal spaceships? This is completely illogical and idiotic. That's not all. The film is also VERY BORING. Even though I watched the whole movie, I lost interest in the first 10 minutes and nearly fell sleep. I mean there's not much action. It's just a bunch of talk 11/12ths of the time. And not interesting talk like the Indiana Jones films. So overall, this is pitiful. It also lacks strong emotion, heart, and development. So overall story of the movie is so depressing, dark, cruel, very boring, and is completely illogical.There's also the characters.

Harrison Ford was wasted because he would underact and sound bored while playing Deckard. Deckard is charmless, and bland. The creator of the Replicants amazes me because of how forgettable he is. Then there's Sebastian. He's actually a 25 year old who do to health problems looks so old, but he does collect toys and show a smile, which is why he is the best character of the movie. So yeah, these characters are so boring, undeveloped, and such that it is just unappealing.That's your answer. Blade Runner is the steaming pile of crud.

To achieve something like that in 1982 is a big deal, and to inspire a generation of filmmakers by doing so is a huge feat.

It was only saved by the ideas of its original author Philip K. Dick who was more interested in exploring the dark side of American future. It is debatable as to how much of that vision was accurate, but some Americans today have widely acknowledged its dangerous similarity to the present situation. It is interesting why an author of that caliber, who lived during the glory days of USA, had such a bad dream about his nation.Sir Ridley Scott (of 1982) is absolutely fantastic as a visualizer, but his lack of storytelling sensibilities is highly evident in how he has handled that flawed material. He is very successful at creating such an immersive experience that, if the viewer willfully suspends his belief, can feel like he had a bad nightmare.

While watching the movie, I was instantly blown away by how realistic this dystopian future was. It seemed straight out of 1984.The story is based in L.A. during the year 2019. The film follows Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), who's job is to track down and kill \"replicants\" (a replicant is a human clone that was used for slavery years before. By the time Blade Runner begins, replicants a considered illegal and now must be destroyed). While the premise has been done before, what makes it stand out above the rest is the theme of man vs. machine. Ironic that it's the machine at the end that gives the monologue about life, rather than the human characters. It's also ironic that aside from Harrison Ford, all the replicants are alive and cherish life and are more fleshed out in character development than the human characters.Another aspect of the film that is exhilarating is the unbelievable, visual beauty that exists in Blade Runner. From the cinematography to the production design, everything about it seems real and alive. The film is over 30 years old; yet I can't find one thing in the film that looks the least bit dated. There was absolutely no computers used in the effects, and yet, the \"Blade Runner\" world looks completely authentic. Luckily, it's finally starting to be recognized as one of THE seminal special-effect films. I love how incredibly meticulous the details are. From Japan's influence in our country's future culture, to the neon umbrellas, it still looks like we're heading in that direction. Every building looks like it exists, every vehicle that flies passed the camera shines rings of light into the lense. It's film making at it's finest.Perfectly fitting with the visuals of the film, is the musical score done by Vangelis. The unbelievably beautiful use of synth music blended together with blues and jazz is something that truly makes Blade Runner what it is.

Daryl Hannah,Edward James Olmos, Sean Young, and William Sanderson all created great memorable characters, but with out a doubt, the two people that really need the most mentioning are Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer. Both Ford's and Hauer's performances are really unique and exciting. Deckard is one of the best protagonists and Batty is one of the best antagonists. The way Hauer delivered some of his dialogue is truly mesmerizing, while Ford's performance is more physical, but equally engaging. The closing monologue by Hauer at the end is really though provoking, and makes the audience question life.Blade Runnner really is a director's film. This is Ridley Scott's movie, one can see him and his mind on every frame of film. Scott created things that no one else would have ever thought of, and that's why it's still remembered. It's still ahead of it's time, and it still makes people want to watch it over and over again. It's definitely a film worth multiple viewings. I wasn't a huge fan the first time a saw. The second time I watched I liked it just a bit more. The third time I watched it I liked a LOT more, and the fourth time I watched it I really fell in love with.

Seeing it as a kid, I hated it, expecting another STAR WARS. Instead what I got was a dark, gritty and downbeat film noir with little action to recommend it and a rather slow storyline. Now, as an adult, having seen the director's cut, I can confirm that this is truly a great movie with plenty of subtexts, strong themes and surprising plot twists to keep you watching through the slow spots. Visually the film is a treat, with Ridley Scott continuing his dank vision of the future from ALIEN and transporting it from space to Earth. The special effects are great, but the best thing of all is that the film isn't trashy. Scott doesn't let technology distract us from the strong detective storyline, doesn't stage any flashy laser gun battles or flying chases.The (short) action sequences are dark and dirty with an emphasis on realism. Fighters bleed here, and copiously. The chase through the house at the end of the film is great stuff and the film doesn't skimp on violence either. Harrison Ford, our hero, shoots fleeing women in the back and is nearly killed on numerous instances until chance saves him. This isn't a thrill-a-minute shoot-em-up at all. In fact it's quite different and difficult to describe, feeling strangely old-fashioned despite the futuristic setting and premise. The script is fantastic and there are moments of true poetry to enjoy \u2013 especially Rutger Hauer's death scene at the end of the film which is one of the landmarks of cinema. Ford is grungy and miserable as the investigating \"blade runner\" and somehow his world-weary performance fits the bill nicely. The supporting cast of androids is fantastic \u2013 Hauer is at his prime, Sean Young is heartbreaking, Daryl Hannah mischievously evil, Brion James is a brutal thug, Joanna Cassidy just plain weird.There are plenty of other nicely subtle performances here too. William Sanderson (FIGHT FOR YOUR LIFE) as weird toy maker and geneticist J.F. Sebastien is memorably odd and Edward James Olmos is a mysterious cop who seems to know everything. Add in plenty of supporting regulars, tons of atmosphere and suspense and the unpredictable, original narrative, plus the original storyline from sci-fi writer Philip K.

Especially considering the time it was released in. Keep in mind Star Wars and the Empire Strikes Back had just been released and people were in very involved in that tone those science fiction movies had. The Star Wars movies (even Empire, as dark as it is) are less serious films. In fact, the original Star Wars story was created by George Lucas as a sort of homage to old Flash Gordon adventure serials, which were pretty silly and not at all serious to say the least. So Blade Runner came out in 1982 and it was very misunderstood. Critics and audiences alike thought it was too slow and lacked character development. Even Roger Ebert said: \"It looks fabulous, it uses special effects to create a new world of its own, but it is thin in its human story. \" when the movie had come out. If you don't know, Blade Runner has been released multiple times over the years. This review will be exclusively for the Final Cut of the movie, which is widely considered the greatest. Roger Ebert even took back his previous statements about character development when he saw the Final Cut of the movie and gave it a perfect 4/4. This is just an example of initial reactions of the movie. So like I said, a lot of people didn't enjoy Blade Runner because the masses thought it was slow, but others liked its many brainy ideas. It didn't make too much money initially, and became a sort of cult phenomenon. Blade Runner still manages to look amazing after 30 years since its release. This is a movie that achieved something great by creating a future that seems new and modern with amazing new technology, but at the same time, it managed to create a very dark, dirty environment that somehow seems old as well. Something about this film is that it never feels like there is hope. It is an extremely dark movie. I love the practical effects they used in this movie to create buildings, cars, weapons and more. The effort put into this project is truly magnificent. Blade Runner, the Final Cut is a masterpiece. It's slow, but never boring, every scene is important, no scene feels out of place.

Being a Christopher Nolan fan myself, I can say that I can see how Nolan's cinematography is influenced by this particular film. Other than visuals, and the way the story is shown, also the score fitted perfectly. Some sort of progressive rock merged into a filmscore, with powerful electric sounds that fitted perfectly the cyberpunk atmosphere. As for the gore in the film, I myself checked what does it consist of in the IMDb parents' guide. Literally, the way it's described makes it seem more gory than what it is. And as I was one of those people that turned around into certain scenes of the lord pf the rings, you can judge wheter you can handle it or not.

Science Fiction should be about analysing theories and philosophies, maybe in a futuristic or other-worldly environment, and in my opinion, 'Blade Runner' is second to none in epitomising every aspect of deep Science Fiction that I have mentioned.The film is loosely based on a novel written by Philip K. Dick named 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'. The screenplay was written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, of course in collaboration with the master filmmaker Ridley Scott who directed this film. It is set in the Los Angeles of 2019. This dystopian,futuristic L.A. is almost disturbingly dark, bleak, overpopulated and there is distinct contrast between the world of the haves and the world of the have- nots. The rich upper class reside in giant skyscrapers, while the lower to the lower-middle class live in dirty living conditions in the rumbling, overpopulated streets. We are told that Replicants were robots created by human beings. The Nexus 6 model of Replicants look like humans and are stronger and equally intelligent as the scientists who created them. But the only thing that they are supposed to look is emotion and empathy for others. These Replicants were used for slave labor, mainly to acquire Off-world territories for expansion. But the Replicants revolted and the they were subsequently deemed illegal and officers by the name of Blade Runners were employed to not execute, but 'retire' them.'Blade Runner' is one of the most thematically deep films I have ever seen. There are a whole array of ideas that are explored in the film. I think the primary theme running through the film is the quest for your own identity. Most of us are assigned this identity by society and we are supposed to look, act and talk in a manner which will be deemed appropriate for our identity. But in reality we spend our entire lives searching for our true identity as a person to give our lives a meaning. In a very similar way, in the world of Blade Runner, Replicants who were created by humans are rejected and deemed illegal when they revolt and demand human treatment instead of slave treatment as in the eyes of society, they are not humans. So, there is also clearly an element of equality or the lack of it which is explored in the script along with the existence of discrimination based on someone's identity in the society as a whole. The film deals with existential issues about what it means to be human. The Replicants are supposed to be devoid of emotions, which is the one thing that sets them apart from human beings, but ironically we see human beings show very little empathy during the film while the Replicants display genuine love and care for each other. The film can also be seen from a standpoint of religion. The relationship between the Replicants and their human creators can be seen as an allegory for the relationship between Man and God. Some people have certain expectations from God, the creator and when these expectations don't get met, they gradually stray away from God and abandon him/her. Death plays a huge part to underline the allegorical element. The production design is absolutely fantastic. Ridley Scott along with his collaborators gives us a living, breathing, bustling version of Scott's almost noir-ish vision of futuristic world. The attention to detail is so convincing that the viewer will feel like a part of the world depicted in the film. Ridley Scott's direction makes the world and the characters completely believable and his style always prevents 'Blade Runner' from becoming a commercial action film. The relationship between Deckard the Blade Runner played by Harrison Ford and the city reminded me of Travis Bickle's relationship with the city of New York. The New York in 'Taxi Driver' and the futuristic L.A. in 'Blade Runner' are both dark, dirty and dangerous, but still, they have a strange seductive beauty about them. Deckard, like Bickle wanders around the streets (as a Blade Runner trying to catch Replicants) and then wallows in his solitude and loneliness in the confines of his home. This is one of Harrison Ford's best performances. I think so because Deckard is a far more complex character than the characters which are more famous like Han Solo or Indiana Jones. This is because Deckard is not a stereotypical handsome, bad-ass who cracks witty one-liners and exudes machismo. This man is someone who is struggling with his identity and his loneliness and in a way the whole film revolves around this character's arc. The story moves ahead with Deckard's self realisations and changes in his opinions and Ford comes up with an understated and nuanced performance. Rutger Hauer's performance as the Replicant Roy Batty is just amazing. Instead of being a standard villain, the brilliant writing allows Roy to be more than a villain, as his motivations and opinions are very understandable and relateable. Hauer's perfect gestures and line delivery makes his character layered and worthy of empathy. Sean Young as Rachael also is great. Her performance is controlled and she beautifully adjusts her acting with the gradual psychological changes that her character undergoes. 'Blade Runner' is an existential masterpiece set in a dystopian future which never backs away from tackling very profound themes and issues. The characters are all real and the world instead of being comic bookish, is very symbolic and allegorical. Blade Runner is also one of the most influential films ever and it is deemed to be one of the few works of art which pioneered the birth of the genre of Cyberpunk.

The \"what makes us human?\" topic is a meaty one, and they give it the treatment it deserves in Blade Runner. The opening scenes with the Voight-Kampff tests are an excellent lead-in to this discussion as they challenge the viewer to ask themselves \"How would I react in these situations?\" That engagement with the viewer does a lot to draw them into the story. The vivid setting elements pull the viewer in even deeper.Art-house films are more of an acquired taste; they require some patience from the viewer. 2001 kind of set the example for art-house/sci-fi, and I think Blade Runner was following in it's wake. A lot of people badmouth Alien 3 for similar reasons. The big issue there, I think, was that audiences were expecting a sci-fi/action movie (like they got with Aliens (2)) and were served up a slower-paced, more arty, piece instead. Mismanaged expectations. Zardoz is another art-house/sci-fi film along these lines.Classic Noir films (e.g. 40s-50s era) are typified by bleak tones: people are trapped in unpleasant situations, the world around them is corrupt, and the characters typically drive toward a doomed fate. (The \"Private Eye giving a voice-over\" is also a hallmark of the noir genre.) I've typically described noir as \"part crime drama, part psychological thriller, part bittersweet romance.\" Neo-noir builds on the genre and typically adds the following elements: identity crises, memory issues / subjectivity, and -- most importantly -- technological problems and their social ramifications.

There is not enough communication through the film to the audience to make a connection and quite frankly I cannot even consider a second view for the fear of going through the same two hours again.If you like Sci-Fi or Noir films, look for other options.

Ridley Scott's film succeeds on many levels, most notably its beautiful aesthetic; the vivid, metallic cinematography set the visual template that thousands of mostly inferior blockbusters have since adopted. However, the thing that elevates this film above the rest is that its beauty is not exclusive to its visuals - the sound-scape, storyline and symbolism are also outstanding in their execution. One thing that the film does particularly well is to draw you into its world to the point where you almost forget that you're watching it on a screen. This is done partially with the outstanding set design, but also through the background sounds. The noises of rain, traffic and the city imitate perfectly the sounds of a real city - they constantly suggest that the world you are watching does not end just outside the frame, but encompasses an entire metropolis. On top of impressive acting and a strong story, the use of religious imagery often lends extra weight to already powerful scenes. Costume design, such as Batty's oddly white hair (a reflection of his unnaturally rapid ageing), also helps us to understand what the characters are thinking about and struggling with.

I've only seen this movie once and it was years ago and just on a computer screen and yet the movie is exactly the same as I remember. Either I have an incredible memory or Blade Runner has some magical quality that makes it unforgettable.The tone makes this movie. The feel of it, the way it washes over you and stays with you afterwards is more significant than the story itself. It's dark and somewhat gloomy. But not depressing, just kind of sad or contemplative. It's refreshing that it's not trying to be funny or deep or clever. It just tells its story matter-of-factly. It weighs down on you over time. There are no light moments of comic relief (although there is plenty of subtle humour). That kind of tension is enjoyable when so many films are impatient and predictable.It raises interesting questions about artificial life. What would it be like to realise that you were actually an android? A bit like Dark City and The Matrix, you have to ask yourself what you really know for sure. Are your memories real? Is that air you're breathing? The steady pace of the film allows you to fill the quiet moments with your own thoughts and considerations. It allows you to meditate on these themes, this futuristic world which we might one day live in.Blade Runner could be one of the most influential films ever made. It's visual style is incredible. It's Gothic, dream-like, iconic and other things that I'm not good at describing. Many of the shots seem to have an immediate emotional or psychological impact, they mesmerise or relax you in some way. They sear into your memory. The music by Vangelis is also gorgeous and haunting. It fits with (or maybe sets) the mood of the movie perfectly.Perhaps loneliness is another theme of Blade Runner. Deckard doesn't seem to have any family or friends. He doesn't say much. He doesn't smile or laugh or cry (nor do most of the characters). But you always have an intuitive sense of what he's thinking or feeling. Maybe the simplicity of the character is what makes him more believable and easy to relate to - we can project ourselves onto him.The replicants sometimes show more emotion than the human characters. Sean Young is beautiful, her eyes are always alive even as her body is still. Rutger Hauer makes a very cool, fascinating villain. He is so calm and gentlemanly and yet ominous (a bit like Bane) and says so many poetic and insightful lines. It makes you wonder, what is humanity anyway? Why are we sad when someone dies? Did God create us with a purpose? Why did he give us our flaws?I felt some of the violence was over-the-top and unnecessary. It didn't add to the story. But at least this isn't Prometheus.Blade Runner is a must-see as far as movies go. It has similarities to so many other movies I can think of and yet it came out before all of them. It's a vivid sci-fi, film noir story. I have to give it a 10 because it is so unique and made me feel things I haven't felt in years.

The Tyrell Corporation's motto, \"more human than human,\" serves as the basis for exploring this experience through true humans and created humans, or Replicants. Symbolism of the meaning of humanity in contrast with \"otherness\" are woven throughout the film, relying largely on biblical metaphors. The movie presents us with types of angels, demons, Heaven and God as the creator as well as illusions to Christ, much like the theme and symbolisms use in the film The Life of Pi.The replicants represent the fallen angels in the Bible, or demons. Numerous passages relate the angels as servants to the followers of God, but these angels/replicants fell from grace when they mutinied against their creators. Likewise, the demons of the Bible are angels that fell from God's grace and were cast out of Heaven when they rebelled against God's authority. A powerful symbol that recurs throughout the movie is that of the eye. The Bible uses the illustration of the eyes many times to show its importance as a gate to the soul. Jesus says in the Gospel of Matthew, \"The light of the body is the eye.\" Retired cop, Rick Deckard, played by Harrison Ford, is forced out of retirement to resume his position as a Blade Runner. His mission is to \"retire\" or eliminate the four Replicants that have escaped from off-world colonies and have made their way to earth to meet the man who created them and to find the answer to every lasting life. The Replicants or \"skin-jobs\" are androids/humanoids were banned from earth and used as slave labor on earth colonies. Due to their intelligence, they are programed to breakdown or \"die\" after four years to prevent them from developing human emotions or feelings.Deckard must battle and destroy the four replicants: Leon Kolwalski (Brion James); Zhora (Joanna Cassidy) the snake lady; Roy Batty( Rutger Hauer) and Roy's girlfriend, Pris (Daryl Hannah). Eldon Tyrell, the creator of the Replicants, asks Deckard to demonstrate the effectiveness of a machine that is used to identify if someone is a replicant or a human. He is asked to perform the test on Tyrell's employee, Rachel. It takes 100 questions before Deckard determines that she is indeed a replicant. She plays a major role in saving Deckard's life during an altercation with Leon Kolwalski. The special effects in Blade Runner are paramount, since they were created by camera and not computer-generated images. The lighting throughout the film, along with the voice-over narration by Deckard, and the shapely, form fitted dresses worn by Rachel, gives us the impression of a dark futuristic film that is reminiscent of a 1940s black and white movie. This effect is well played and lends a bit of mystique to the picture. The opening scene of the Los Angeles skyline reflecting off the iris of an eye is breathing taking and symbolic of God's view of his earthly creation.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 3}, "heading": "A Futuristic Dystopian Metaphor of Biblical Representations", "date": "2015-06-19T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3261416"}, {"content": "I LOVE Blade Runner!

My favorite movie, Pulp Fiction, has a stunning and nearly mind-blowing ending. The same goes for other films I love such as Psycho, Memento, The Prestige, and It's a Wonderful Life. But when I read Blade Runner I read it as a boring movie with a great ending which gives the film great meaning. I haven't seen the theatrical version, but I have seen clips of it, and I think the voice-overs by Deckard take away from the film even more. While the noir film usually relies on narration, this film is fine with this aspect taken away, leaving Deckard's thoughts more ambiguous to us as an audience.I have to admit I think the concept of the film is intriguing. We learn with the help of text at the film's opening that replicants have been created as slaves, but since they are intelligent they have turned on their creators. The title of the film refers to those who are meant to \"retire\" these replicants.The mise-en-scene of the film has a Gothic quality to it which really leaves me with an unpleasant taste in my mouth. It fits into the noir aspect of the film since it is so dark, but it also has a really creepy quality to it which the film does not need. In scenes revolving around Sebastian, the man creates these \"friends\" for himself, these living puppets in a sense, which underscores the motif in the film of playing God, or creating life. The replicant Pris seems to blend in with these creations since she looks otherworldly, with white makeup covering her face, black around the eyes, hair almost as light as her makeup. It's like she is from the circus, which does not belong in a movie revolving around city life.Perhaps the mise-en-scene will grow on me over time; I hated it on first viewing, but I realize it adds to the dark tone of the movie and is fitting. In a final fight between the Blade Runner and Roy, Roy shows compassion and helps Deckard to live since he is about to die, but we have no idea when Roy is meant to die, just that his life is running out due to a four year lifespan. While he gives a brilliant monologue, Roy dies with no preparation for the audience. We might have viewed Roy with more empathy if we knew he was going to die in a matter of minutes, but it is still a powerful death.The movie has a brilliant ending in which an origami unicorn is placed in Deckard's place. It is said that replicants have built-in memories, and earlier in the film he dreams of a unicorn.

Based on the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? by Phillip K Dick, this was director Ridley Scott's second sci-fi film after Alien (1979). It's set in L.A. of 2019, which is now a polluted dystopia full of huge overbearing billboards and enormous skyscraper blocks that resemble Mayan temples. The heavy clouds and constant rain ensure that all events play out in a constant darkness. In this future there are advanced androids called replicants, which are used for dangerous activities such as off-world colonisations. A rogue group of these machines rebel and return to earth with deadly intent. A detective who specialises in assassinating them - a blade runner - is given the task of seeking and 'retiring' them.The specific combination of a world in permanent darkness and a detective storyline featuring a world-weary policeman results in perhaps the ultimate example of tech-noir, which is a combination of science fiction with the feel of traditional film noir mysteries. The very original production design used to construct this future world is probably the single most notable feature of the film and is what defines it. Both the cityscapes and the retro-styled interiors are very well conceived and delivered. The script and acting are both good too with Harrison Ford perfectly cast in the lead role and Rutger Hauer never better as the lead android; we also have a very memorable turn from Daryl Hannah as a pleasure model replicant. Rounding things off is a famous synth score from Vangelis; unfortunately, the film only features the brilliant main theme in the final credits.There have been three different cuts of the movie over the years. I saw the original one several years ago and have recently seen the 'Final Cut' (I never saw the 'Director's Cut'). There are quite a lot of amendments in this last version but the main one that people remember mostly is the ending in which an earlier unicorn dream and origami model are used subtly to suggest that the protagonist is a replicant himself. The ending is certainly darker than the original one but not without hope, after all the message of the film is an ironic one in that it is suggested that it is only the replicants who experience true living in this world. Human drudgery on earth is nothing compared to what these androids experience in their shorter lifespan.

I didn't fully understand everything that was going on. So I watched the features. The documentaries that came with the film. Later on, I watched the film again with the Ridley Scott commentary.

Not my favorite Harrison Ford character, but far from my least favorite. He's not Indiana Jones or Han Solo, he's something very different, but it works. Pris. Daryl Hanah's replicant character is extremely iconic and the visual of her as Pris is something that always pops in my mind when I think of Blade Runner. Sultry and seductive but always dangerous, Pris is my second favorite character in the movie.At the end of the day Blade Runner is middle of the road for me.

Back then I wasn't impressed by Blade Runner at all, probably because I was expecting Han Solo rather than the introverted action we get with the Ridley Scott film.Then I saw it again as a young adult, and appreciated it a lot more. It still felt slightly detached, a bit cool (the cold kind), but I understood it much better.Almost 20 years later I finally get round to watching it a third time. Kubrick's 2001 has a very similar watch-history, and upon its third-viewing just a few weeks ago I declared it my Number 1 favourite film, giving it an easy 10/10 (only 7 of my 700 rated films are a 10).As a sci-fi fan I was fully expecting Blade Runner to similarly WOW me...alas, it somehow fell just a bit short. That cool, detached vibe was still there. The scenes, as memorable as they are, just sort of happen without much viewer connection (especially the famous final speech). The Final Cut version - first time I've seen this edition - has a couple of jarring edits which added to this odd feeling (check out how the edit cuts after the nose-pulling scene, and another example how after Batty says to JF: \"I'm sorry, Sebastian.

Many consider this a cult classic but in my opinion I didn't like it just as much as some seem to do as at times it can seem very slow and very strange and almost like it wasn't made by a legendary director such as Ridley Scott. Its a film you have to see to understand and neo noir sci-fi mixes together to create a film that I just didn't enjoy and found it below par.Now I cannot doubt Harrison Ford here as he really does nothing wrong to damage the piece but he also never pushes hard on the pedal and ends up seeming confused for large parts of the movie. Overall the acting is never bad but with such strange lines and parts where acting well goes out the window, I couldn't help feel bad even though no one here does a bad job necessarily. As I mentioned on the script, for me it is one of if not the worst thing about this film, lines just not good and many don't make much sense.Ridley Scott doesn't direct badly but the ideas aren't there to be able to move the scene along well. At times it can almost seem as if the plot is going a little too slow and not a lot happens, now some people claim this to be good because it's Sci-fi without action but even if, it isn't entertaining to see constant shots of the skyline and effects. One point in the technical department is that the cinematography is beautiful and for me is a strong showing from Jordan Croneweth who seems to be able to at least bring a little more excitement to the movie.On the point of Rutger Hauer, he is a good villain no doubt with sinister stares and some striking blonde hair, he really stands out in an otherwise tame cast. One point in this I truly likes is the ending, not to give anything away but it brings the movie to life and is easily the best bit and most exciting. This is the kind of movie you really have to watch and not do anything else, if you blink you may miss something and understanding what every person says in this is key to how the plot plays out and why it is that way in the first place.If your looking for big effects you get them but then if you expect large action scenes, shoot outs galore and all the Sci-Fi things that are considered the norm, then you will be sorely disappointed. This is truly a crime thriller but not an action and although things do happen at times, it is up to you whether you want more action or it is just right. The movie seems to create a dystopian vision of the future earth in which man has made a mistake and has to deal with it, one thing about the future that is kind of neat is the way in which languages are combined and evolved and society seems to not only dress and sound different, but just act completely different too.Overall I felt this was firmly an under average movie and although not quite poor, still for me just doesn't work. I think there are fans out there that proclaim anyone who doesn't like this a stupid person but I think in the case of Blade Runner it not only comes down to personal preference, but also how well you decide to understand and study the movie. This isn't all bad and I think I'm in the minority who dislike it, watch it and give it a go, and try to see the directors cut, I think most fans agree that's the way to go.", "rating": 5, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 8, "votes": 20}, "heading": "A cult classic I just didn't like", "date": "2015-02-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3179420"}, {"content": "****Warning: Spoilers**** Blade Runner is a fantastic film that was released in 1982, which is taking a futuristic look into the year 2019 taking place in Los Angeles. The main actor in the film is Harrison Ford, who plays Rick Deckard, Sean young as Rachael, and Rutger Hauer as Roy. Deckard is an ex-cop whose job title is a Blade Runner. A blade runner is a person who has the task of hunting down and retiring replicant's that are human clones that were utilized for labor on other planets that was created by Tyrell Corporation. A group of replicant's became very violent, killing humans. A law was set in place making them illegal on Earth and the penalty was execution (Retirement). Early in the film the leader of the replicant's Roy is seeking out answers for how he and the others can live past their four year life span. Deckard through the film starts to have feelings for a special replicant Rachael and learns replicant's have memories of other people implanted in them. In the end, Roy begins to understand what it's truly like to value life and saves Deckard after their violent encounter. In the very last scene, Deckard leaves with Rachael to live out the rest of their lives.One of the themes to Blade Runner is morality. Deckard early in the film says that if replicant's are dangerous it's his problem otherwise they are fine. This shows he knows that is wrong to retire a replicant when they are not threat. This grows further later in the film after Rachael saves Deckard life from another replicant. Deckard's boss wants him to track down Rachael, but he ensures her that he won't do it, but someone else might. Then in the final scene where Roy is chasing Deckard on the roof and saves his life is another example. Roy had the opportunity to kill Deckard but pulls him up from the ledge of the building. Roy speaks to Deckard for one last time before his life span ends. Deckard comes to the realization that Roy had truly loved and valued all life which is why he let him live. One of the biggest techniques utilized in Blade Runner was the usage of the lighting. The overall movie was very dark, and the different lighting they had used was well done. The darkness had helped show the futuristic looking city of Los Angeles. I also noticed the film remained dark the majority of the film until the end when Deckard and Rachael were driving away to live out their lives together. Another scene that stood out to me is the final speech Roy gives, the lighting had helped strengthen the emotion. Another technique utilized was motifs. The one that I spotted was origami, I believed the origami is there to remind Decker that Rachael is not real or about their relationship. The origami appears several times and again at the end of the film when Gaff played by Edward James Olmos leaves it outside Deckard's apartment. I believe this movie is outstanding, this is now one of my top favorites. It shows that you can do what it is right and if you value life enough you can find your own answers to what's most important. I'd like to also point out that I had watched both the original theatrical version and the director's cut. The major difference between the two is the original had narration and the director's cut did not. I preferred the original because the narration added more detailed explanations of what was going on. The acting was very good, especially with the actors who played the replicant's. They had to try and show fake emotions, which I imagine was difficult to pull off.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Blade Runner Theatrical *Spoilers!*", "date": "2015-02-07T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3178826"}, {"content": "***User-reviewer jaywolfenstien (\"A frame to die for\", jaywolfenstien from USA, 2 February 2008) has a good commentary.***\"Blade Runner (1982, Ridley Scott) Final Cut\", a dystopian sci-fi, is enjoyable. Adhering to the now ubiquitous visual plan of contemporary fantasy/horror cinema, we see a lot of colorized smoke along with moody and/or pulsating lighting. It is described as neo- film noir; and two noir characteristics are washed out streets and freely burning tobacco. While the story is uneven it has an unusually beautiful principal cast. Just as there are multiple versions of \"Blade Runner\", it seems that everyone has their own opinion about where it belongs when ranking all-time science fiction.It is set 37 years from the film's release (2019), in a Los Angeles that is majority Asian. This Los Angeles also possesses a formidable skyline with many tall, imposing buildings featuring grim architecture. The Tyrell Corporation, a totalitarian central command structure in complete control over the human population, is manufacturing replicants. Replicants are robots intended to labor under dangerous conditions on other planets. They are engineered with physical powers superior to humans. They also have consciousness. To keep them down, the latest firmware grants them only a four year lifetime. If replicants ever set foot on Earth it is up to a Blade Runner (i.e., a contract assassin affiliated with the LAPD) to \"retire\" them ASAP, typically by use of a loud, high- caliber handgun. As the story begins there are four replicants who have stolen a space ship and escaped to Earth. Gloomy and weary Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is hired to retire them.A Blade Runner can distinguish a replicant from a human by means of a test (named Voight-Kampff) that is delivered orally. The questions are hypothetical and from what we know, always contain triggers that recall the Milgram experiment. (BTW, there has never been a psychological experiment more important than Milgram. Every school on Earth should teach it. But I digress.) At the urging of Mr. Tyrell (the hands-on CEO of the mighty empire) Deckard gives the test to Tyrell's assistant Rachael (Sean Young). Although she believes she is human, Deckard concludes that she is a machine with implanted memories. Normally, this is cause for Deckard to use his gun. However, he hesitates to retire Rachael. The relationship between the pair is vital to the story. It also drives speculation and debate among \"Blade Runner\" fans over whether Deckard is actually a replicant himself. The Final Cut version of the film does not conclusively inform us one way or the other. The replicants all seem intentionally more interesting than Deckard. So do Decker's work colleagues Gaff (Edward James Olmos) and Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh). While Deckard has a dogged persistence that is admirable, as he retires one replicant after another, it is usually the machine which wins the heart of the viewer. While trying not to spoil things, three of the targeted replicants make things easy for Deckard by breaking off a physical attack that would take advantage of their insurmountable strength. One replicant responds to the threat posed by itchy-trigger-fingered Deckard by demonstrating a killer set of fast-moving handstands. This is fun to observe but not effective in battle against an armed hunter. Generally, it seems that the replicants are the ones offering some humanity to the atmosphere while the brutal Tyler Corporation is suppressing it. Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), the leader of the four mutinous replicants, is occasionally very appealing (even though we also see him kill a human by crushing the victim's skull). Roy is most empathetic when he clamors despairingly for a longer life. As this is in clear contrast to Deckard's misanthropy, the replicant leader garners interest at the expense of the protagonist.An issue I have with \"Blade Runner\" is Ridley Scott's dull direction. I am not fond of how modern sci-fi/horror films look. There is no single image that seems to stand out and/or inspire a second glance. It is tempting to say it appears as if were filmed through a Coke bottle. Blade Runner also has innumerable close-ups and cutting back and forth between characters. Scott's imagery just is not distinctive to where \"Blade Runner\" can be regarded as an elite science fiction film.Still, there may be nothing more appealing to many cinema-goers than watching a contract killer removing elements of society who are inconvenient to power. If you don't mind occasional eruptions of extreme violence, the beautiful cast and the prospect of experiencing a world (slightly) more authoritarian than ours today makes this a fun diversion. Yet, I don't recommend bringing kids to it. (Not unless you want them to grow up as contract killers. But why not? All that matters is getting paid.)", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Humane Robots", "date": "2015-01-26T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3175578"}, {"content": "Hey!

True, many have tried to imitate it, and in the thirty odd years since its release it has influenced countless movies, TV series, anime and video games to one degree or another. Yet while all of these have copied elements of it, none of them have ever captured its exact balance of sci-fi, noir, and philosophy, or replicated its unique atmosphere and otherworldly feel. And none of them had Harrison Ford in the lead and Ridley Scott in the director's chair.For those few not familiar with the story, Ford plays Rick Deckard, a detective tasked with tracking and eliminating replicants, genetic constructs made to perfectly mimic the humans they serve. Since an incident years before, replicants have been banned from earth, upon penalty of death. But now four of them have taken that risk, leaving a wake of death behind them as they search for the key to their very existence. And it's up to Deckard to find them and stop them before they strike again.Their leader, Roy, is easily one of the most menacing villains ever to grace the screen. He is so perfect it's unsettling. Gifted with the looks of a professional model and the body and athleticism of a champion quarterback, his every word and expression exudes keen intelligence- and unmistakable madness. He is the kind of being who knows exactly what he wants and how to get it, and he is not the type to let anything or anyone get in his way. Nor is he the only thing Deckard has to worry about We don't see enough of Leon or Zhora to get much of an impression of them, beyond the fact that they too are desperate and dangerous. Priss however we see very much of; in more ways than one. Beautiful, alluring, and manipulative, she's like a deadly exotic flower, drawing you in to suffocate you in her poison. And then there's Rachel, the replicant who doesn't know she's a replicant. Her demeanor, clothing, and her ever present cigarette remind one of a down and out moll in an old detective movie. Though she barely knows who she really is, she could be a useful ally to Deckard, or possibly something much more.One of the things that sticks with you the most about this movie is the incredible atmosphere that pervades it. Like any good dystopian sci-fi or hard-boiled detective movie, everything here is dark, heavy, and more than a little threatening. The LA of 2019 is crowded, dirty, and run down. Chinese writing and noodle stands are everywhere, as if Chinatown has overrun all LA. Hover cars fly over decaying apartment blocks and flashing theater matin\u00e9es out of pre Giuliani Manhattan while fantastic monads and pyramids loom over the horizon like a latter day Babylon. Inside the futuristic and the antiquated vie as well in rooms filled with computer screens and electrical tubing alongside candelabras and crumbling plasterwork. And endless rain comes down in sheets over it all, running down every crevice and drenching any who brave the streets. Everywhere neon signs, industrial flares, and searchlights illuminate the cityscape, yet nowhere is it enough to hold back the shadows which bathe the streets. For it's the shadows- both physical and metaphorical- that make the world within the film. The director and cinematographers do as many things with these shadows as the best expressionist filmmaker. They use them to alternately obscure and draw attention to faces and scenery, to heighten the sense of danger and mystery, to create harsh contrasts with the blinding strobes and searchlights. And they remind us that everything that's happening is happening within the shadows of society, the dirty underbelly unseen by the good folks safe in their homes. And just as well that it is. For this is a world filled with violence and corruption not fit for innocent eyes, and the filmmaker's don't let you forget it for a moment, especially not in the action scenes. With slow motion and bluesy synth music, Zhara's death is as stylized and artificial as anything in Blade Runner's world. Yet at the same time it's drawn out, bloody, even traumatic. The editing and camera work aren't trying to make it look cool, they're emphasizing the fact that a desperate frightened woman is dying alone on a rainy sidewalk. To paraphrase the film's most famous line, the report may read \"routine retirement of a replicant\", but it won't make Deckard feel any better about shooting a woman in the back. Yet for all its impact this scene doesn't even begin to compare with the finale. Deckard's final showdown with Roy is mesmerizing in its beauty and brutality; a demented fever dream hunt, like Most Dangerous Game blended with Olympia and German expressionist horror. Even out of his mind and with his body betraying him, Roy is the superior combatant to Deckard in every way. In a strait on fight to the finish it would all be over in an instant. But what we get instead is so much more violent, intriguing, and spellbinding. And in the end it leaves us with so many questions to ponder; about memory, morality, and what it truly means to be human.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 7}, "heading": "A Deep and Atmospheric Sci-fi Masterpiece for All Time", "date": "2014-12-06T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3137185"}, {"content": "I can easily see why this film has become the cult movie it is today, regularly championed as one of the best sci-fi movies ever made. Considering it was made almost thirty years ago, it's still visually stunning with its neo-noir gloomy cinematography, the exterior shots made darker still with seemingly constant heavy rain mixed with an imaginative future vision taking in flying cars and outsize, almost floating video-advertisements, the latter at once familiar in its common-placedness and yet disturbing in its exaggeration and omnipresence.There really isn't that much of a story with Ford basically re-hired by the police force he previously left to track down four humanistic androids (called replicants) escaped to earth from a space colony and now determined to revenge themselves on their creator. Besides some interaction between Ford and the replicant creator's is-she-or-isn't-she P.A., the film moves inevitably towards a final confrontation between Ford's Deckard's character and the replicant leader, the sadistic, revengeful Rutger Houer.For me though, the film loves its own look a little too much and is ponderous to watch at times, interspersed by scenes of random but brutal violence. We fleetingly come across minor human characters who seem to have regressed from society none more so than JF Sebastian who becomes their link to ultimate target megalomaniac Tyrell, who lives in cluttered squalor alone with his homemade mechanical toys and robots.In fact I'll take cluttered squalor as pretty much my description of the whole movie. Inevitably it devolves to a showdown between a rampaging, but fast expiring Hauer and an exhausted, beaten-up Ford which doesn't play out as you'd expect and an enigmatic final scene which interestingly questions whether Deckard's mightn't be a replicant himself.\"Blade Runner\" certainly succeeds in serving up a bleak vision of the future reminiscent of Fritz Lang's epochal \"Metropolis\" decades earlier. At times nightmarish in its sheer banality, it can be seen to have inspired future generations of directors and writers in film and print.

Frankly speaking, I felt totally bored by its first half where nothing much happens. But the same was build up to the one best endings I have ever seen for any movie(talking about the final cut of the film).The message it tries to convey is very deep and philosophical which sometimes may not be understood in one viewing. The second time you see it, you are well aware of the pacing so you can indulge in the beauty of the film(more or less like viewing 2001: A Space Odyssey).Harrison Ford plays Deckard who is a Blade Runner. Blade Runner is a guy who hunts Replicants. Now Replicants which were clones created for working as slaves by a conglomerate called Tyrell Corporation. But later they are outlawed on Earth due to their tendency towards violence. Now some 4 replicants have made it to LA in pursuit of their creator and its Deckard's task to 'retire' them.Well the best thing about the movie is not its plot or story but the visuals. The dark and gloomy portrayal of the LA city is quite haunting. Makes you immediately think of our imminent future.The cinematography is top-notch. Also the questions it raise about humanity are golden, such as the meaning being a human , our resistance to our imminent death, can we be so technologically advanced that we can defy the laws of nature and so on.This is what pure sci-fi movies should be about generating thoughts and questions in our minds.The music by Vangelis adds remarkably to the haunting experience the film gives. Among the performances Harrison Ford does justice to his role of Blade Runner a character who slowly starts to understand what it is like to be replicant. The best performance is by Rutger Hauer playing Roy Batty the leader of the escaped replicants. A scene involving him and Deckard towards the end is one of the most heart-touching moments ever portrayed in movies.If you do not like the movie on your first view better suggest watch it again knowing what the movie is about and is trying to say. Also I would recommend the final cut of the film. Right now, this is my favorite science-fiction movie till date (yes, I prefer it more over the ambiguous and long 2001).

This movie is definitely worth watching as long as the viewer is willing to be fully engaged in the movie throughout its duration. Blade Runner is a suspenseful film containing several plot twists and important minor details. Likewise, this movie is known for being a point of discussion in the field of philosophy for a reason, it raises very large questions about humanity and what it takes to love. The story of Blade Runner is that of a human being tracking down and killing humanoids, while falling in love with one. However, it isn't until the very closing of the movie until the viewer learns that Deckard, the main character; supposedly human, is in fact a replicant himself. This raises questions for the viewer like, \"do replicants, humanoids, have souls,\" \"why can't a human love a replicant, who is, for almost every aspect, human\" and \"why is it suddenly okay for a replicant to love a replicant if supposedly replicants can't love?\" Likewise this movie forces the viewer to try to define love and its relationship, or lack thereof, with having a soul. I believe that Professor David Reeve answers some of these questions rather well; \"if replicant love is or can become real love however, the question of who has a soul may not matter all that much\" (Reeve, David). The humanoids are not referred to as having souls because they weren't born like normal human beings. Professor Reeve notes the importance of having a childhood to having the ability to love and respond to circumstances with the correct response. It is our mothers that teach us to love and our childhood that teaches us how to respond to new events. It is less common for adults to experience new events, so generally adults have the ability to respond accordingly. This is why it is some important that Rachel had memories, even if they weren't hers. Rachel metaphorically did know what it was like to be loved unconditionally by her fictitious mother so much so that she strongly believed she was human. However again, can a non-human know love, and do these memories give her a soul? These are questions that the viewer is required to answer throughout the movie, and then again with Deckard. The writers of this film did an outstanding job of forcing the viewer to question such deep questions about humanity and what it means to love. Again, I would recommend this movie to anyone willing and capable of critically analyzing a movie, but for those who watch movies just to relax, I would not. This rather suspenseful movie requires a deeper level of thinking in order to understand the full context. Blade Runner set the stage for many sci-fi movies and this is perhaps the reason it performed so poorly in movie theaters (\"Blade Runner.\" \u2013RottenTomatoes). While this film contains several deep underlying concepts its cinematography is only decent. Perhaps at the time the movie was filmed it could have been state-of-the-art, but it has certainly been surpassed. The special effects in this movie are on par with B perhaps even C-list movies, but the acting is tolerable. In addition Blade Runner is not a happy go lucky feel good movie, its dismal settings and suspenseful scenes leave the viewer on edge. While these characteristics may be favored in horror films, I was not prepared for them. This movie should not be viewed by children either, but that is for the reasons of nudity and a particularly disturbing scene that involves borderline rape. The viewing of Blade Runner requires a certain level of maturity in order to enjoy and understand.My recommendation of Blade Runner is split on the basis of entertainment and content. For the everyday movie goer who just wants to sit back and watch a story happen in front of them I would not recommend this movie because of its lacking cinematography and acting. On the other hand however, I highly recommend this film to mature intellectuals. This movie's content, especially the role of Rachel, encourages the philosophical query of love and humanity in a manner that most people would blatantly ignore. If the producers of Blade Runner were trying to target their movie at a target consumer group including older intellectuals, I would agree that they succeeded at doing so and would recommend this movie to them.

My latest viewing was of the Director's Cut; it's been quite a while since I've seen the original with Harrison Ford's narration, so comparisons don't come easy at this point. Even so, I've been enthralled by the picture every time I've seen it.Thinking about it today as I write this, we're only five years away from Ridley Scott's original vision set in Los Angeles of 2019. Robot technology seems to be in the news just about every day now, though nothing remotely approaches the wizardry of replicants, but who knows how far things will go. It's going to get pretty interesting.As for the picture, after each viewing it takes a few more days for it to completely leave my thoughts. One hopes that the future doesn't resolve to the type of dystopian darkness that films like this and the Terminator films manage to depict.

The one remaining question is; beyond its technical and artistic merits, is 'Blade Runner' a great film? The answer is, or at least my answer is, almost.Is it a bit cold and emotionless? Yes, but that's its tone not a flaw. Is it a bit confusing? For certain, but sci-fi of this type rarely spoon-feeds you every last detail. There are dozens of ways to interpret this film.

Harrison Ford stars in Blade Runner. Set in the mega futuristic City of LA, Rick Deckard is a former special cop who hunts down human looking Cyborgs called Replicants. In a city that is a blend of 19th century and 21st century architecture Deckard must reprise his role as a Blade Runner when a group of Replicants return to Earth seeking answers to their questions.Blade Runner was made at a time when the Sci Fi genre was just beginning with Star Trek, Star Wars and Alien all becoming major movies during that period of the late 70's early 80's. This film continues in that form. It combines the realism of Alien with the fantasy of Star Trek. Director Ridley Scott did a brilliant job in portraying a megacity. The costumes, feel and elaborate set up of the city exemplifies how a mega city would really look like. The Cyborgs running around as murderers, the night club and market places that are shown give us perspective on how the people on the streets behaved instead of just focusing on the skyscrapers. The characters lacked much of an impact on the movie since the sheer size of the city dwarfed their importance. Deckard becomes involved with Replicant women while the Geneticist responsible for creating these Cyborgs comes to a nasty end at their hands. This title is stunning to watch but very hard to understand. There is a similarity with other earlier Sci Fi movies, Metropolis being one. Thoroughly enjoyable seeing Harrison Ford play an excellent protagonist. He is particularly good in these movies because he is both an accomplished actor and can do these action packed scenes as well.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 3}, "heading": "Masterpiece in Visuals.", "date": "2014-09-14T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3086483"}, {"content": "Who knew a film named \"Blade Runner\", a movie with such high praise, could be so boring.

Its dark, its detailed, and shows off the culture and technology.Other than that? As an action film, its abysmally paced, with no special scenes or charismatic characters. As a \"deep, philosophical\" film...I don't buy it. You can't support your themes without strong characters. And Blade Runner's entire cast is uninteresting. It may have been intentional for them to be lifeless and robotic, but this movie didn't make me care about machines. Why even bother answering the questions this movie supposedly asks? \"Is genetic engineering ethical? What makes us human?\" Who cares? I don't care anymore after this film than I did before.The noir romantic relationship had zero impact on me. Just as typical and shallow as any other relationship from the genre.

It left me unsettled. The slower pace and moody content weren't what I was used to. It isn't a regular Hollywood blockbuster film. Then I let it sink in, and I realised that it was phenomenal, and I had to watch it again, and again, and again.The first version that I watched was the one featuring Deckard's voice-over, Rick Deckard being the world-weary detective played by a smooth Harrison Ford, which is not favoured by film purists, but works for me as it links it to the film noir genre. The version without the voice-over is just as good, but it does fill in some richer details and lends the proceedings more of a hard-boiled feel.Mention must be made of the scintillating Vangelis soundtrack, the use of the electronic instruments clashing with the natural orchestral score mirroring the struggle between natural and synthetic life in the film.The look of Blade Runner is magnificent, owing a large debt to graphic artist Moebius and to the Futurist artistic movement. Blade Runner contains a stunning depiction of a living, breathing near-future - but is any of it real? We know early on that Rachael, the cool Sean Young, is not human, but a Replicant, or synthesised robotic cyborg, known as \u0080skin jobs\u0080 to the less than sensitive police clientele. Yet are the Replicants, who witness \u0080things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion\u0080\u00a6 C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time\u0080\u00a6 like tears in rain\u0080\u00a6\u0080, which is one of the most beautiful speeches in the history of cinema, are they perhaps more real than the seedy cops who live in squalid hovels and question suspects in smoky offices? Blade Runner gives us a near perfect vision of a dystopian future that has not been bettered. From the flashing, pixellated advertising billboards, through the neon sign-decked side streets, with their market stalls selling ersatz animals and vat-grown human organs as created by the Tyrell Corporation, up to the skies filled with flying vehicles and flaming smokestacks, each enthralling element is skilfully crafted and put on display for us to gawp wild-eyed and open-mouthed at.As Deckard tracks down four rebel Replicants, their leader Roy Batty, given an exuberant performance by Rutger Hauer, he becomes uncertain about the task he has been handed, but has to see it through, or die in the process.The film, in its Directors Cut, also manages to achieve the astounding feat of turning reality inside out in your head, flipping the world on its axis in a highly disorientating way.

The fantastic visual effects we see occupy the film for the briefest of moments. They don't really factor into the story AT ALL, other than just as a reminder that indeed, this story takes place in the future. As one other person pointed out, the ENTIRE film takes place at night, and if it's technically daytime out, then every scene is suddenly indoors. You just never see the light of day. The initial title sequence and score is GREAT, but it's like it's all meant for some other storyline/film.2. What kind of future is this? Outside of a few gadgets like the Void-Kampf machine (which might as well be a polygraph), and perhaps the darkening technology that we see in Mr. Tyrell's penthouse, the only other examples of advanced technology are the spinner cars, Deckard's gun (maybe), and the replicants themselves...which as far as I can tell and the movie relates, aren't really androids, but rather, test-tube humans grown in a lab with bioengineered short lifespans. Not exactly advanced robotics. Other than their physical strength (which seems misused as none of them seem to know anything about fighting, even Roy, and their strength really just doesn't feature in the story much other than them beating up on Deckard a few times), they might as well BE humans. Honestly the plot makes more sense if they weren't replicants in the robotic sense, but the bioengineered test-tube humans I've suggested. This is all the more apparent by Roy's discussion with Tyrell over extended his lifespan, when all that they discuss are cell structures and virus chain molecules, etc, etc...clearly suggesting that the 'replicants' are simply test-tube humans. Another thing I didn't get is the fact that the replicants bleed like any other human when injured, so again, not exactly robots. And, why does a combat-model replicant experience extreme pain when driving a nail into his hand, but not when he gets hit in the head with a crowbar, or when he drives his head through a wall? It's like the story only fits whatever it's trying to accomplish per scene.....Continuing on with the 'future' thing, Why is virtually everything so utterly retro? Contemporary technology (ceiling fans, TV sets, radios, late model cars, etc) can be seen all throughout the film, giving you the idea that this 'future' is really just an alternate reality set in current day (for 1982). No attempts are really made to depict giant viewscreens, small devices that were if anything, predicted even in the 80's... Other than the brief visual FX we see (point#1), they should well have just set this story in today's world. There's really no reason anything that we see in the movie couldn't well have taken place today. The film completely wastes its futuristic setting.3. The suggestions that Deckard is a replicant are stupid. The movie goes out of its way to depict Roy and Rachael's persons as the pinnacle of replicant technology, but Deckard is just as weak as any other human. The question has to be asked WHY would you even create a replicant as frail as a normal human if indeed his job was to hunt other replicants who can hand him his own arse in a fight? It would make more sense that ROY was a Blade Runner. Additionally, if anyone is going to know what Deckard is, it's Tyrell, and yet he interacts with Deckard in a standard way, and even the other replicants treat Deckard as they would a human. I also didn't observe anything Deckard's character does in the film as 'good', in that he displays no apparent skills at tracking down replicants that any other cop wouldn't have. His chief calls him in out of semi-retirement saying he wants the old magic, but other than getting himself beat up half the time and being super-lucky the other, I don't get it.4. It seems kinda stupid that if these replicants are prone to escaping (indeed, they have cops specifically tasked with tracking them down), then it would make sense maybe to have some sort of remote control switchoff device or something? It's like, hey, this is the far future where mankind is apparently out exploring other planets outside our solar system, but we can't keep a handle on the numbered and created replicants? If they're gonna design them with limited lifespans, why not a kill switch or something else? Ack, makes no sense.5. About the only thing that makes any real sense in this story is Rachael discovering that she's not actually human. They could have done something with that. Perhaps make an entire story centered around her character learning this tidbit, then her trying to extend her life after going through all the emotional trauma, and then being hunted down by a blade runner. It would accomplish everything this movie was trying to tell, but failed at.6. Indeed, there's really no explanation why the replicants themselves are so utterly violent and psychopathic. This isn't in their programming. Leon is an ammunition loader programmed to take orders and designed for his strength, Pris is a pleasure model. Only Roy and Zora are combat oriented, yet as such, they would likely be level-headed and cautious. It's kinda odd that all of them so easily transcend their 'programming' and pretty much go around killing everyone they encounter. Instead of killing Tyrell, the best outcome I could have seen for Roy upon learning that he can't extend his life is to maybe just enjoy his remaining days, or the scene end with him sobbing uncontrollably like a child, and maybe for Tyrell to take pity on him and turn him off some other way, or maybe to show him that via other models, Roy's memories might live on in a way.

That is what Ridley Scott has gave \"and will\" give generations of future film-makers with his magnum opus, \"BLADE RUNNER\".

The man just finished the behemoth that is \"Alien\" (1979), and proves he still had a lot more to offer the science fiction genre. Like Alejandero Jodorowsky before him, failure to get an adaptation of Frank Herbert's \"Dune\" going, made him sign on to work on this masterpiece.If you haven't seen it, here's what your missing. Futuristic city visuals set in a dirty, smoke ridden Los Angeles, Androids i.e. \"Replicants\" in the form of a young Daryl Hannah, and a career best from Rutger Hauer. Stellar action scenes evoking classic Film-Noir, and possibly my favourite of all Harrison Ford performances (\"Raiders\" is my favourite film & Han Solo is my favourite smuggler, but in this role he finally gives us a gruff detective persona that fits well within what he's capable of).The film itself gets very philosophical. The entire narrative derives heavily from the classic Phillip K. Dick novel \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\", which I've read and adored. But even doing so the film questions who is & isn't human, a class system of sorts, what is a human made of via. depth and mind and is our hero a replicant himself? Questions that come off less preachy and more profound towards the movies conclusion. Though I found it very complex first time around, future showings had lifted the smoke around the movie to reveal one of the best cinematic experiences around.

I have the big collectors box set, and must get round to the following versions.Other than that, everything about it looks like it jumped out of an illustration. Vangelis music makes everything grand especially in the hallway of mirrors, and final moments on top of rooftops and final soliloquies have gone on to become immortalised in cinema.Final Verdict: 10/10.

The Replicants are robots created to help humans but inevitably end up showing some emotions (as Rachel) and the blade runner (Harrison Ford) tries to catch a glimpse of this humanity in them because astonished by it. In close ups it is shown how actors perfectly control their face expressions; their performance is excellent throughout the movie. The problem remains that when the audience comes at the end of the movie some questions are left unanswered. In the movie Pris tells Sebastian: \"is that why you are still on Earth?\" humans are in this Off-World place.. but since when? and why? We don't get any deep description of any action or any character. There is a restricted narrative because the audience in 1982 is mesmerized by this future, science-fiction movies always have this power to amaze with their special effects and with their frequent jump cuts.

I think, trying to view this as an allegory that Mary Shelley had in mind when she wrote 'Frankenstein' (The replicants that Deckard is hunting down) is quite rewarding as well.Observing each interaction that Sean Young and Ford's characters have, esp. in the light of the final 'reveal' is also immensely rewarding. Featuring some of the most violent imagery, completely in context with the subject material, along with one of the longest drawn-out climax sequences ever, with perhaps one of the most powerfully-motivated villains, who we actually end up rooting for (I dare anyone not to be 'affected' by the goings-on at that time, and the events leading to it); this is one unforgettable work of art that needs to be enjoyed only on the big screen.Having lived in a region where this was never released theatrically, how did I get to watch it on the big screen?

Maybe this is because I had already watched 2001: A Space Odyssey before Blade Runner. On most \"Best Sci-Fi Movies of All-Time\" lists, 2001 is usually first. For this reason, I decided to watch it. And it is incredibly boring. Don't get me wrong, I do admire 2001 very much. But nothing will ever make me think that some guy flying through an iTunes visualizer for ten minutes is entertaining (and yes, I know that particular sequence was groundbreaking for its time but it's not incredibly impressive now). Blade Runner doesn't stop its story to create its ambiance. You feel the atmosphere while the plot is moving forward. But Blade Runner also isn't some totally philosophical and pretentious movie. It isn't completely devoid of action or romance.And I must say that my favorite cut of the movie is the original American theatrical cut.

Olmos. so in short..., we have a great ensemble cast with major Hollywood A- list actors included, great special effects for its time, a great sci-fi short story written by Phil K Dick, one of the most hauntingly beautifully shot films(in my opinion) and one of the greatest directors of ours or any time and a thought provoking and argument causing theme. so what is there not to like about the movie??? one of the great American films and in my mind a magical achievement which director Scott will never top.definitely requires multiple viewings and then multiple viewings on top of that.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 2}, "heading": "yes!...a good movie with every scene shot at night and with rain", "date": "2014-04-09T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2994888"}, {"content": "Perhaps I'm alone or one of the few who really loved the original version with Deckard's voice-over.

Why? Because reading this means that you've probably seen this crap of the movie, and you're wondering what happened, how this tedious, ugly, pointless crap could possibly be so highly rated?

First of all, the creators of this \"masterpiece\" have used the irritating clich\u00e9 of setting the entire film at night. It's always dark, in every single scene. Every single room is ugly. The makeup is ugly. The whole damn thing looks like a hell hole full of broken drug addicts, and the music contributes to the feeling. I felt mild nausea throughout the whole thing. There are a few visually interesting scenes of Los Angeles from above (at night, of course), but the most prominent thing in those scenes are gigantic videos (placed as advertisements on buildings) of Asian women swallowing pills. Maybe the best symbol, of how wrong the makers of this movie were about the future, were prominent advertisements for Atari and Pan Am.

Dick. There are several changes to the original book which itself was very surrealistic. The spirit however of Dick's book is still here. The film brings in some ideas that improve on the book and writers Hampton Fincher and David Webb Peoples deserve some praise. Philip K Dick himself approved of the film , although he saw only the opening 20 minutes of footage prior to his death on 2 March 1982. It's interesting that Ridley Scott and one of the writers David Webb Peoples never read Dick's novel. \"Blade runner\" was the first time that Dick had been adapted to film.\"Blade runner\" asks the same question as the book \u2013 What it means to be a human ? Philip K Dick read diaries written by S.S. men and was shocked by the sheer cruelty and lack of empathy he found in them . He thought that those Germans didn't deserve to be called humans , despite the look like ones. That's where the idea for book came from.\"Blade runner \" requires patience and full attention from the audience. There is little action here and the movie is very slow paced. The story seems very simple , almost thin on the surface , but underneath it there's a depth really seen. \"BR\" is so full of themes and symbols that it's impossible to catch them all on first viewing . I've seen this movie five times and I'm still discovering new things on repeated viewings. It's just as deep as \"2001 : Space odyssey\", but far more entertaining and involving emotionally thank Kubrick's movie. Who could forget the unicorn at the end ? \"Blade runner\" is a visionary movie. It pretty much pioneers much of the vision that became a Cyberpunk genre in publishing. William Gibson , considered a pioneer of that genre with his \"Neuromancer\" (1984) almost gave up writing , because \"BR\" had so much of his vision in it. \"BR\" is a rare case of movie prefiguring a trend in literature. \"BR\" also inspired many movies with it's vision of killer robots (\"Terminator\" is the most known and the best of them all).It's one of the most visually beautiful movies I have ever seen. The level of detail on is amazing, even though much of it is often seen on screen. It gives you the impression that what you see is only the tip of an iceberg. The future we see is an abstraction of the present. Los Angeles in 2019 is an overpopulated city, with flying cars , non-stop rain , extremely diverse culturally (punks , Chinese , Jews and Hare Krishna living together in one metropolis) and full of commercials (Atari , Coca cola). Designer Syd Mead and FX wizard Douglas Trumbull deserve every penny the studio paid them for this piece of art. The special effects are genuinely AMAZING after all those years and the movie has dated incredibly well .The music by Vangelis fits the movie perfectly . It's so mythical and dream-like , with a touch of 80's feel as well. It's one of the greatest soundtracks ever . The movie gives the viewer a haunting melancholic feel and largely thanks to the superb music.\"Blade runner\" wants the audience to think about the impact of technology and capitalism on human society , dehumanization in world ruled by corporations and media , meaning of life , personal identity , destructive nature of humanity , lack of freedom and polluted environment.Harrison Ford (\"Raiders of lost ark\") is great as a burned out detective with a weakness for drinking Frank Deckard (reference to Descartes). His lifeless performance fits the movie perfectly . His dull , bored , cold character that slowly during the movie will rediscover (or discover ?) his humanity thanks to the replicants. The real star is however Rutger Hauer (\"The Hitcher\") as Roy Batty. His fantastic performance is perfect \u2013 he managed to capture all of human emotions : child-like sense of wonder , fear of death , raw brutality , deep love , need for beauty. His not a simple villain , more like anti-hero who is in a way a portrait of whole humanity. The third main character is Rachel played by Sean Young (\"No way out\"). While very sexy and a obvious nod to femme fatales from noir movies , Young also makes her character a very delicate and likable.The supporting performances are great too . Edward James Olmos (\"Stand and deliver\") is really creepy, mysterious and memorable as Gaff (who could forget his little paper figures) . M. Emmett Walsh (\"Few good men\") makes a nice cynical police chief. Daryl Hannah (Kill Bill\") has some Harley Quinn personality in her Pris. Joanna Cassidy (\"Who framed Roger Rabbit\") is strong as Zhora , while Brion James (\"48 hours\") is menacing as Leon. Joe Turkel (\"The Shinning\") is a true gentleman as the intelligent Eldon Tyrell.This is the best science fiction movie ever made. It might be the best movie of the 80's and it's a strong contender for the title of the best movie ever made. Ridley Scott is talking now about making a sequel .

But afterwards reconsidered my thinking and decided to put emphasis on the leading 3 titles as I pre-conceive it. So 1st place goes to \"Blade Runner\" (1982) - a science fiction movie, which credits belong fore mostly to author Philip K. Dick and his successful bargain to sell copyright of his novel \"Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?\" upon which the film was subsequently based. Unfortunately, Dick died prematurely from heart attack at age 53 shortly before Film Premiere. \"Blade Runner\" is still a Rotten Tomato movie, which means that with score 8.5 out of 10 it remains highly unappreciated by public awareness. This is very strange and pity at the same time, since 30 years have passed and the Movie can't deliver its message which ostensibly purports the idea of World populated by Androids. Today the meaning of \"android\" is hollow and means some gimmicks or trinkets for everyday use, while the original conception came as semi-organic yet artificial creation. This is at least what lies on the surface etymologically.My 2nd and 3rd choice are with Isaac Asimov's short stories on Robots. Here comes \"Bicentennial Man\" (1999) and \"I, Robot\" (2004) but maybe also some other less popular titles that I don't know or remember. The strength here comes from the fact that those are full length movies with typology Human Characters played by androids (robots). I stress here on the \"noxious\" implication of humanoids that exempt human life and became its substitutes or alter ego. This is fruitful area of thinking but needs more time for assimilation. For instance, how should be solved the problem for aging given that morbidity doesn't pose threats any longer. How do we embrace the idea of longevity and yet look shrunken, behave numbed. It seems that it's not only a matter of empathy but we have to peg it with self-centeredness as well. Things like that.Let me see whether I can coin an instant story for this Movie. I owned a perfect VHS copy of \"Blade Runner\" in the 1980s with the image of apple tree from the Ladd Company. In the 1990s I throw all my VHS cassettes in the garbage bin because there was already satellite TV, PC for mass communication and rudiments of Network; so I worked a lot on sideway activities and did some traveling worldwide. In the 2000s there was slowly this Internet phenomenon that was gaining speed and also the family unification syndrome (as if people haven't seen and know each other for decades); I became strangled in mass hysteria and started to experience globalization on my own ass in the form of arrows and various phantom pains. Everything got screwed since, even my DVD copy of \"Blade Runner\" didn't look lucrative enough to watch multiple times. Maybe because of that awesome letter-box format that I don't understand to the extent why digital technicians produce it at all. Lastly, a Blu Ray version of the Movie exist from 2010s with over three hours of additional materials that I haven't seen or reviewed personally.So I will continue my Poor Richard Almanac with some scattered notes. The thing that mostly attracted me in \"Blade Runner\" when I saw it in 1980s was its perfect Cast. All of them actors that participated in principal roles from the Movie were young, beautiful, daring and enterprising. Today, they are in their 50s and 60s which lump them in category \"third age\". They are not exactly retired but their performance lack the vigor and dynamism from 30 years ago. That's what the meaning to be an Android - to stay forever in your prime (if you are not bored of it some day).Brian James in the role of Leon Kowalski was the worst choice for an Android. Except his excellent physique, the dramatic appearance of that Actor is very shallow. But Brian James did many secondary roles in films that I like very much. Something like Anthony Quinn less the international awards. He died in 1999, aged 54.Ridley Scott is a superb Director. \"Blade Runner\" was his third successful movie after \"Duelists\" (1977) and \"Alien\" (1979). I don't understand what makes him think that the personage of Rick Deckard the Bladerunner (Harrison Ford) was a replicant. Deckard was dreaming and this sole attribute is enough to classify him as Human. Replicants don't dream, they have implanted memories in their mind.

Blade Runner tells the tale of a futuristic policeman, specifically a blade runner, who's hired to track down 4 replicants. The blade runner is played by Harrison Ford, and he takes the job after thinking about retiring on the force. The setting for Blade Runner takes place in the futuristic year of 2019, where Los Angeles is overpopulated by Americans and Asian Americans. The leader of the replicants group is an albino, played by Rutger Hauer. His mission on Earth is to track down the creator who made him and the other robots. One of those robots is a female, played by Daryl Hannah. Blade Runner has a good story to it and it's beautifully told. But, the big surprise in this movie is the art-direction and visual effects. The whole city of Los Angeles is lit with neon lit signs and giant advertising posters that really enhances the culture aspects and look of the future. Harrison Ford is also convincing as the leading role. This is actually his best since Raiders of the Lost Ark. Rutger Hauer is very frightening and very good as the killer robot with a vengeance. I like how the movie uses the 1940's film-noir style to it, creating a feel of mystery to the story. Believe it or not, I am a sci-fi geek. I really enjoy watching science-fiction mainly because science-fiction movies are thought-provoking and brilliant about the way the story is told. But, the visual effects in Blade Runner doesn't undermine the story. The special effects are indeed, exhilarating. The look and feel of this rainy and depressing city is very similar to other movies that followed after this one. What's surprising is that Blade Runner did not do well at the box office, probably because people didn't quite understand the concept and story of it. Yet, another sci-fi movie, E.T., did a lot more better than Blade Runner. In fact, E.T. grossed over $435,110,554 that year. It was also one of the best films of that year, and compare to Blade Runner, it's different in its tone and look. I find this to be very disappointing. What I mean is that movies within the same genre should be viewed the same and be reviewed as films that will make cinema history. I think that Blade Runner deserved the same kind of criticism as E.T. does because both movies relied on different stories, but inside, there's a meaning to it. If audiences and critics can't seem to rendered that fact, the movies are in for a rude awakening. In a nutshell, Blade Runner is a excellent sci-fi movie, filled with interesting characters that we care for and a set that's worth a look at. It is also one of the best films of 1982. \u2605\u2605\u2605\u2605 4 stars.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 4}, "heading": "Blade Runner is one of the two best science fiction films of 1982", "date": "2013-11-03T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2899115"}, {"content": "Blade Runner left \"Bigfoot\" imprint on the science fiction genre 1982. Sci-fi flicks have a pattern of letdowns, but Blade Runner is something special, sustaining freshness when viewed in today's times. Ridley Scott's ambitious vision still questions the audience about the future when Blade Runner's version of \"the future\" is less than a decade away from our time. Scott, though not restricted to the sic-fi genre, unlocks the director's comfort zone and possibly his area of interest. He has a certain feel to his films that can be linked together and recognized through the auteur theory. Blade Runner also weighs on genre theory in it's attack of the humanity's future in the science fiction category.The visuals for Blade Runner need not an extra injection of \"film-botox\", the release year doesn't concern itself with the picture's longevity. When making the decisions for Blade Runner, Scott has his mind in the future imagining what the decor would look like, the clothing that we may wear, and the technology that could corrupt us. The obvious, blue-glow to the photography is beautiful and doesn't feel as cheap as other futuristic tales display their films. The selection of shots and cuts are placed perfectly, including the closeups I love from Scott's films. The sound echoes all the gadgets and violence a neo-noir-sci-fi film can release.Films that predict the future sometimes become cheeky and cryptic with what they want to say; thankfully Blade Runner sprints past those urges and gives its audience everything up front, though the quantity of what they have to spread is quite sizable. Will there eventually be a new race of humans? Are we becoming robots? Who is who? What makes us a human? What makes us a person? Can what we do change who we are? What are the limits of love? I'd even go as far to say Blade Runner hints around issues of race, homosexuality, and slavery. Ridley Scott is almost trying to ply open American's simple-minded views in 1982.Blade Runner is as artful as you can be without becoming pretentious. It's a film requiring your attention, thought, and repeated viewings. Don't worry it's still fun to watch; it has cool action scenes and impeccable blocking. The characters are enriched with feelings of the real world, which adds another layer of identification for Blade Runner's audiences to latch onto. From 1982's eye view, it appeared that Ridley Scott wasn't an optimistic onlooker of the years yet to come. Maybe his opinions were influenced by a vision of his later career never topping his work with Blade Runner and 1979's Alien.Rating: 9Grade: A", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 4}, "heading": "Appropriately Questions the Future", "date": "2013-11-01T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2897893"}, {"content": "When contemporary critics and audiences discuss about their favorite sci-fi films and they usually contain the same films; and one of those films include Blade Runner. I do think that Blade Runner is a fantastic science fiction film but I also think it ranks up with the best neo-noir films of all time.Blade Runner's screenplay is written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, and it is based on Philip K. Dick's novel \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\". This film definitely progressed Peoples' writing career, attached with films like Unforgiven and 12 Monkeys. I have not read Dick's novel, so I came into this film blind. The film's plot takes a story that seems to touch familiar ground in previous noir films but putting a sci-fi twist to it, and I think it's intriguing and had me constantly thinking about the social and political structure of the film's world. Fancher and Peoples has written a protagonist that doesn't tell or show much and it had me curious on what his view is of the current situation and the world. I did find some of the dialogue a little vague and lacking texture but it does achieve in driving the hardboiled tone that Ridley Scott was going for. I also wished that there was more depth in the story, allowing us to explore the comprehensive world that Deckard is in.Ridley Scott directed this film, who amazed me with his previous film \"Alien\". Scott approached Alien in a more straightforward kind of way, focusing more on the terror and the need for survival. Blade Runner on the other hand is much more complex and walks on the tight rope between two completely different genres. Scott was able to balance both noir and sci-fi, which made this film very unique for its time. I felt that Scott was held back in achieving his true vision as some moments feel a bit empty and need a bit more time to achieve it's true potential. The film is a major step forward in special effects and the scope of what effects can do. The film's effects are clearly influenced by other sci-fi films that preceded it, which includes Close Encounters of the Third Kind and Star Wars.Blade Runner's director of photography was the late Jordan Cronenweth. The cinematography is one the main areas that convey the noir-ish tone of the film. The film definitely feels stylish which is one of the main reasons that attracted me to the film again and again. Cronenweth's use of shadows and the use of low key lighting accentuate the dark emotional weight of the film's story. The exterior scenes, which is filled with neon lights and rain, look gorgeous and keeps the audience feeling mesmerized. The film's photography has influenced future films like Total Recall (2012) and Minority Report.Blade Runner's score is composed by Vangelis, who previously worked on Chariots of Fire. I really like the score of this film as it incorporates the futuristic sound of synthesizers and electronic while also keeping that classic noir sound, music driven by either saxophone or piano. It definitely sounds more personal and intimate in comparison to big science fiction films like Star Wars, which is operatic and grand.Harrison Ford is definitely great in this film but cannot say that this was his best work. Ford does not have a lot to work with as his character does not have a lot of emotional depth. Rutger Hauer was fantastic in this film as he portrays with such unpredictability and eeriness that he kept me on my toes during the film, particularly the third act. Sean Young was great here, sexy and innocent, but I felt that writers did not write enough about her character.Blade Runner is a science-fiction and neo-noir classic, and has influenced many films that came after it. It has a great story with an interesting setting, supported by great acting, stylish photography and an inspired score.

Humanity has produced a race of robots (replicants) who are, apart from emotions, identical to humans. They serve to perform slave labor in the so called \"off-world colonies\". But the robots seemed a little too human and turned against their makers, by which they became a threat. The \"Blade Runners\", a special unit of the government, were assigned to identify these replicants and eliminate them.This is the synopsis of Blade Runner, a masterpiece by Ridley Scott from 1982. It's superior cast of people who are determined to transcend themselves is key to make an instant classic. The blue eyes, blonde hair and grimace from ear to ear of Rutger Hauer made him the ultimate ice-cold replicant, while Harrison Ford, after Star Wars and Raiders Of The Lost Ark, proved his ability to present a complex and morally charged character. The role of composer Vangelis was also of great importance. He created a delicious and almost Spartan sober sound-scape, which echoed the perfect cries of an unhinged future. And what would the movie have been without the miraculous special effects of wizard Douglas Trumbull, the man who had polished 2001: A Space Odyssey for all eternity.Upon release, the movie turned out to be a flop, but not for long.

Dick posed the question: \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" It seems like an odd thing to ask, but it puts into context the question of what it means to be human; does a human analog, like and android, mimic human behaviour in it's own terms? If life is electric, as opposed to bio-chemical, will that life see other life only as being equally electric? Blade Runner takes Dick's novel \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" and examines that concept. Set in a dark future in which robots are visually indistinguishable from humans, it forces us to ask what it is to be truly human; does humanity require a physical body that is exactly the same as ours, or is our true essence found in the mind and the choices we make? In Blade Runner we encounter military grade androids that are so highly developed, they don't know that they are not human. Or at least they aren't supposed to. At least one of these above average beings seems to develop a strong sense of self and self-preservation that is beyond what the programmer intended. As a result, these automata behave rather badly; it is up to Blade Runner Harrison Ford to stop them. This is where the line between humanity and android begins to blur. Who is more human? The Blade Runner sent to stop the Androids from running amok, or the androids that seek only to live as best they can? Where does the heart truly lie? Is it in only in the soul of a flesh and blood person born of man and woman, or is it possible that even a factory made robot can develop a sense of good, evil and morality that is indistinguishable from that of the human it imitates?

I know this movie is highly regarded by so many movie fans and finally I am starting to see why. I really enjoyed it.The story is about a retired Blade Runner (a cop who is assigned to find and kill replicants) who is forced to come out of retirement to find 4 escaped replicants. A replicant is a human clone designed and created for use in colonies as slaves with a 4 year life span. These 4 replicants have made their way to Earth to find their maker to try and make their lives longer.The story is very good. It is based on a book called \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\" and is made really well.The visuals of this is amazing. I loved the futuristic look and the landscapes were beautiful. It has an awesome 80s feel to it which is one of the best feelings in a movie for me. There are still talks of a sequel to this film which I think would be a mistake. It is not the 80s anymore and that is one of the things that made this great. The new one would feel too modern and would just not have the same effect... just like Star Wars episodes 1-3.The films starred Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah & M.

There is a difference...a classic has passed all accounts of cinematic standards..its beat them all. A cult on the other hand is one that is well liked by many...no reasons given. Most times, the reasons are flawed and this one belongs in that category. Not to digress, but the visuals that I aforementioned - relegates itself to old age cyberpunk,gets well-ingrained into a marginal subculture and becomes the centerpiece of the movie. The character is sidelined, the story goes awry, and the dreary shots of everyday urban Los Angeles, in not-too-distant future gets in your face and repeats itself with staggering consistently. The movie makes a point that despite the technology and the development, there is generally no hope for humanity. The future, my dear friends, has to be depressing and morose, especially for the poor. There is hope, but not for everyone, definitely not for the working class, not for the good only for the technically adept, the rulers of the future. This echoes consistently and is driven home at every turn that Deckard takes..it's always staring in your face like deformed face, wanting you to notice the ugliness, to accept that there is nothing pretty here and you better accept it.When Daryl Hannah,a street whore stepped in and covered herself with papers on the street side...I gave up. Blade Runner,inspite of all the expectations and heart pounding excitement that it garnered within me..had let itself down. And I so..oh so desperately wanted it to shock me with sheer brilliance. But this is another attempt at science fiction, when Ridley Scott was learning his trade. At this juncture, a cinematic genius would have concluded that there is nothing that this young lad can look forward to. But alas, Scott has proved everyone wrong..but not with this one. This one needs to be forgotten!A special mention of course - VANGELIS!! How could a score go so under-utilized? The genius that this score was, should have more than carried the movie...given the right back drop. But Vangelis is no match for the depression-era Los Angeles, cleverly disguised with neon boards and poorly masquerading itself to be 2019. What an eye sore!!While it may be be unwarranted to do so, I take the liberty to contrast this to the science fiction movie of my time - The Matrix. It asks the same questions - What is humanity, can we beat the forces that control us, can we survive this onslaught, is there love, is this life worth it? It answers it too. The difference is - it sets a backdrop where your mind takes hold of it,takes a stand, and root for the good guys. It allows you to recognize yourself- that you are as vulnerable as Neo and yet can do something to change the world. It buys you in. Blade Runner on the other hand, keeps you aloof and at arms length, never opening the door for you to enter the LA of 2019. If does not allow you to emote,to participate, to root for, to empathize. The back drop does not allow this. It says \"stay away\"...every which way it can. While there might be a cult following - multiple viewings, and reading into the flick for more that what it's worth, or going away with questions that even Deckard does not ask..is not being faithful to the spirit of a movie. If it takes multiple viewings to 'get it', it should be a sitcom and a 2 hr flick!!", "rating": 5, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 4}, "heading": "A poor backdrop, a revealing eyesore to an otherwise brilliant undertaking!", "date": "2013-06-22T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2818128"}, {"content": "Blade Runner is an other masterpiece by Ridley Scott.The good.

I had previously seen both the 1992 Director's Cut and the 2007 Final Cut, neither of which made much of an impression on me. Nevertheless, I decided to give the film yet another chance and I'm glad I did.This time I dove into the exhaustive Four-Disc Collector's Edition DVD from 2007. Starting with the international theatrical cut, I moved onto the director's cut and, finally, the 'final' cut. Watching three versions of the film in as many days allowed me to appreciate the fine detail and to better assimilate the movie's intellectual content.For those unfamiliar with the story, it concerns a police officer (Harrison Ford) who is tasked with hunting down a group of replicants (read: androids). His job is complicated by the fact that these replicants look and act almost exactly like humans. This is the setup that propels the film's action but it also opens up the film to some serious metaphysical speculation.The acting is surprisingly impressive for a science fiction movie. Harrison Ford is pretty dependable throughout even though he's overshadowed by both Sean Young & Rutger Hauer. Meanwhile, the supporting cast is populated with several talented actors including Daryl Hannah, Edward James Olmos & James Hong, to name just a few.Perhaps the strongest aspect of the film is the visuals, though. Ridley Scott's direction is impeccable and the cinematography of Jordan Cronenweth is exquisite. Even the now thirty-year-old special effects still look good, if not as seamless as today's best efforts. The finely detailed production design also deserves special mention.Musically, the film benefits greatly from a score by Vangelis. I wouldn't call it timeless by any stretch of the imagination but it nevertheless feels perfectly suited to the film.If the movie has a weak link, it's the script. The theatrical cut is routinely derided for its voice-over and compromised ending but the fact is that they were added for a reason. The narrative is obscure at times and I'm not completely satisfied with the movie's preferred ending. That being said, the story's depth is impressive, even though not all of its ideas are presented with equal effectiveness.In the end, I've arrived at the conclusion that the film is something of a flawed masterpiece. No version of the film that I've seen strikes me as 100% successful. And if you're expecting a relatively faithful adaptation of the book, you certainly won't find it here. I think that reading the novel and seeing the theatrical cut certainly helped me to appreciate the movie more but not everyone has the time or patience for that. Personally, I feel that this is one of those movies that merits watching and re-watching but, when you come down to it, \"Blade Runner\" certainly isn't for everyone.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 5}, "heading": "Fascinating but flawed", "date": "2013-06-21T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2817483"}, {"content": "Plot, Character, Setting, Symbols, Themes: The five components of storytelling, from greatest to least important. Ridley Scott's overemphasis on the last three didn't blind me like so many others to the fact the the plot was limp and the characters were dull. Sure, Blade Runner's visuals were brilliant and the moody tones in the Vangelis soundtrack enhanced the dystopian future setting, but the plot? It's nothing more than Deckard (Harrison Ford) hunting down androids who want to live past their shut down date. Cool premise, I agree, but It's basically a 45 minute Star Trek episode stretched into a two hour show off of visual effects. Even as a 9 year old when I first saw this snore fest the only thing I remembered was the female android's nipples and the flying ships. Years later, in my twenties, when I thought my tastes had matured, I sat in a darkened theatre to see Ridley Scott's directors cut, sans supposed \"annoying\" and \"unnecessary\" Harrison Ford voice-over, that's all that kept me awake through the film. Ford's narration was put into the film by the studio because there was so much dead time between action scenes. Even though a golden rule of writing is to \"Show it-don't tell it,\" the producers wisely realized that without the Ford narration, few audiences members could tolerate the slow pace. The only reason this film made any money was because of Ford's star power and it would have completely bombed were it not for the voice-over.So by the time we got to Rutger Hauer's end of film, \"should have been Oscar nominated\" soliloquy, I was happy the film was finally almost over. I didn't care about the \"mind blowing\" twist at the end inferring that Ford's character Deckard was a replicant either. I was just happy I could go home and get a sleep in my bed instead of the movie theatre chair.High ratings on IMDb for Blade Runner a simply because of non-random sampling bias.

Based loosely on a Phillip K. Dick story called DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP, it chronicles the exploits of Deckard, a blade runner played by Harrison Ford in a wonderfully understated performance. He's been assigned to hunt down and destroy a group of Replicants, robots who look and act human, who escaped from an off-world slaving colony and killed some people. The group, led by Roy Batty- played icily by Rutger Hauer, has become self-aware of their four-year life limit and returned to earth seeking their creators, for more life. The story is set in Los Angeles of the future, where massive skyscrapers and flying cars tower and soar against a constantly dark and rainy sky. That equally matches the undertones of the film: marvels of modern science and technology, along with the dark side of such advances. Throughout the film, there are hints that Deckard himself might be a replicant. And the story has some interesting philosophical points to make about life, death, and memories. It even questions Deckard's job: It seems ridiculous for him to hunt down and kill creations who only want to live longer. The finale between Deckard and Batty is perhaps one of the most chilling and thought-provoking scenes in any sci-fi thriller, and the ending is appropriately dark and somewhat of a downer. But with this type of story, a happy ending would feel unnecessarily tacked on.

As such, this review will attempt to keep such terms to a minimum. In 1979 Ridley Scotts second film that he ever made, \"Alien\", was a smash hit. (His first film ever was \"The Duelist\" in 1977, in case you were wondering). The movie Alien was hailed as a masterpiece in which he mixed visceral horror with science fiction. Its no surprise then, that Scott's third movie, he mixed film noir and science fiction in much the same way to make the technically astonishing movie \"Blade Runner\" based on the 1968 classic by Phillip Dick called \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\". Although it did not do well at the box office, it is another stroke of genius. As the movie starts off, there is a virtual tour of futuristic Los Angeles. The movie watcher is made to feel as if they have awoken from a cryogenic chamber and are observing the changes that have taken place.: The weather and environmental color is drab, there are gigantic animated billboards offering goods and services(something that didn't exist in 1982 but already exists now), and that Coke is still around. Even though the scenes were constructed using 1982 technology, they are still breathless and when viewed on a flat screen TV are close to three dimensional. Next is the introduction to the melancholic Deckard (played by Harrison Ford) who in contrast of the Replicants that he chases, appears to take life for granted. The philosophical themes in this picture are endless. One popular philosophy is that Deckard himself is a Replicant this theory is doubtful as Replicants appear to be superior in strength and maybe even intelligence to humans. Deckard is only able to bring Replicants down to retirement by relying on the one edge that humans have over Replicants: experience. Since Replicants can only live for four years, they do not have as much experience at anything as their human counterparts. In addition to the movies in depth philosophy, Blade Runner makes several realistic predictions: (1) Los Angeles/California is predicted as being culturally isolated and diverse to the point of mayhem. This forecast is even more probable today, than it was in 1982. California and especially Los Angeles has already become extremely diverse culturally. Caucasians no longer represent the majority of the population. Additionally, each ethnic group tends to isolate from the other ethnic groups. There is Chinatown, Korea Town, Olvera Street, and Watts. Each neighborhood has its own cultures and languages that are not only spoken, but seen on Billboards and even street signs. Select cultures are even pandered to by the government. Even though it is currently the law to be a US Citizen to vote and to have a driver's license, and even though it is a requirement to read English to become a US citizen, Drivers License exams and ballots are written in Spanish and many of the Asian languages Right pr wrong,. there is no need or incentive for an immigrant to assimilate into one uniform society. (2) Technology continues to advance at a prolific rate. From 1982 to 2010, technology has grown tremendously. No one in 1982 would have dreamed of DVDs, flat screen TVs, GPS systems, iPods, or cell phones that do just about everything would be in wide use in 2010. Flying cars may not be far off. It would appear that the only thing that might prevent Replicants from ever being built would be a possible ethical/political dilemma much like the one that surrounds cloning. (3) The weather and environment appears to be drearier. As global warming theories and oil and other toxic spills become more prevalent, this event is quite possible. (4) Big Corporations still exist and exert their influence. From the Coke billboards to the billboards offering a better life on a space colony, consumers are still being told that their life is inadequate but could be made better if they purchased certain products or moved to a \"better\" location. Watching the movie leaves one with the feeling of awe. The realism of situations and special effects only serve to enhance this effect.

I really did. After all these years, this critic finally forced himself to watch Blade Runner from start to finish. I guess I got the more recent director's cut since I recall Harrison Ford narrating parts of the film I'd previously seen, but alas this time he had very little to say. They should have kept the narration. If nothing else it may have helped the audience understand and care about him a little more. But with such a moody and gloomy picture combined with its snail pace story, I'm really not sure what could have saved this.The story is interesting enough. Its kind of a police thriller but played out in a futuristic version of Los Angeles. Ford plays some kind of a detective who is assigned to locate and exterminate a handful of \"replicants\". These are androids created to do some type of slave labor on other planets. Apparently they have been deemed too dangerous to be allowed back on earth and must be killed if they are found here. A few scenes show us in graphic detail that they can be capable of psychotic mayhem. Too bad the film isn't even half as interesting as this paragraph makes it sound. Ridley Scott had already struck gold with Alien, but here he tries a much grander kind of science fiction. It just doesn't work.First off, Harrison Ford is miscast. He himself was critical of this film which failed at the box office at a time when he was on top of the world with his Han Solo and Indiana Jones characters. The star power and energy he brought to those roles could never have been allowed on the set of Blade Runner. The production design is grand, yet dreary. Its always raining, and the L.A. we are introduced to seems to never see the sunshine. The street-level sets are impressively detailed, and populated with some wonderful character-actors. The cast, aside from Ford, is terrific. Hauer is perhaps at his best here. Remember when Sean Young was actually a star? Some of the special effects like wide cityscapes and flying objects are unconvincing to say the least. The giant pyramids look just like the models they were, only filmed at special angles attempting to give them the proper scope. The synthesizer score did little for me. Worse than anything though is the fact that its just boring. This plot could have really been crafted into an exciting thriller. It hardly sounds like the script was faithful to the source material, so why not pump some life into this film?

I had to laugh a bit, because for all they came up with: the flying cars, the space colonies \u2013 oh, I forgot to mention that, they're pulling an Aliens before The Company did \u2013 and of course, the replicated humans, themselves, no way they could've made any of that using the computers/monitors displayed in the movie that probably heated up too much when PONG was played.YES \u2013 I know, that's not a flaw, in fact, that was all they had back then, well, those \"state of the 1982 art\" monitors and little patience on imagining what the future computer screens might look like. Heck, if my argument was valid, Director Scott's own Alien ship, the Nostromo, 3-years prior, may never have left the dock considering their monitors were even less sophisticated. So, I wouldn't downgrade the movie for that, I just thought it was funny.At its core, it's the grand tradition of detective stories, it's a 1940's private dick plot set in the future. For 99% of the graphics and ideas, this movie was far ahead of its time 30-years ago and is highly recommended for anyone who hasn't seen it.(SPOILER ALERT \u2013 do NOT read on without having seeing the movie) On a side note, I was a tad bit confused with the ending \u2013 and I'm not referring to the odd cat & mouse chase scene where our \"villain\" strips to his skivvies following him kissing a man on the lips in the segment prior. No, I mean, some idiot person I knew many moons ago spoiled the \"secret\" of who Deckard really was. Since the movie, itself, was left wide open for interpretation, I chose NOT believe my person's take, especially after my research following the film. The original author, Phillip K. Dick, did not make Deckard a replicant and therefore, despite all other theorist's ideas and blatant clues left by Director Scott throughout, I chose to believe Dick.

Before I get into the details of this classic, I cannot stress how much the final cut is the definitive version of this film. If you plan on purchasing this film, that is the best version to buy, hands down. I also cannot stress how much the visuals in Blade Runner make today's high budget CGI movies look like a joke, which they are in my opinion. This is a film noir story spliced with science fiction and the result is something that is unique and still is. A lot of films try so hard to be gritty and dark, and Blade Runner, in my opinion, achieves that in the highest caliber. With it's dystopian setting and bleak story, the movie is very dreamlike.And what this movie achieves in doing is telling a very simple story, but with so much to say. Not a lot happens in the movie, but every scene is vital in progressing the story, without any unnecessary moments of filler. What I love about the film is that it has an ebb and flow to it which feels very intrinsic. When many films do so much and try so hard only to end up failing, Blade Runner easily succeeds by being very subtle.What is very captivating to me is that Ridley Scott created a world that is one of a great imagination. Through the visuals, it has the looks of a world that is very different from our own, but one that is living and breathing, a world that feels run down and claustrophobic to give a feeling of urban alienation, one that exists within our society. The immersiveness of this film is very strong and it takes a great storyteller to pull off a feat as great as that.While Blade Runner is a science fiction film, it hits the heart with its sense of humanity and to me, I think that is what it achieves in being such a sentimental film to me.

Considering that I am nearly 30 years old and a lifelong science fiction fan, it seems odd that I waited this long. Anyway, the version that I watched is the Director's Cut, so I cannot speak to the differences present in the Original Version, the Final Cut, etc. But I came away quite impressed with this film, for its restraint and strange otherness as much as for any of the more obvious, overt virtues that most sci-fi films possess.The visual look of the film is very dark and ultimately bleak in concept, but the images of a future Los Angeles are incredibly executed and often beautiful in a strange, unsettling way. I am not sure how many films I have ever seen that have managed to capture a comparable sort of frightening futuristic realism. It still looks incredible in 2013. There is such a transportative depth to it. What an achievement for a filmmaker in the early 80s.I think that the cast is great, especially Rutger Hauer and Sean Young, but really everyone. (Edward James Olmos, yes.) The musical score by Vangelis is a very effective fit. It reminds me, in a way, of the music from Twin Peaks in the way that it is very slowly, hypnotically emotional. Dialogue is fairly minimal relative to most films; this one uses images, physical emotionality and a haunting, aching used of dark and selective light to tell the story.And it definitely requires the viewer to pay close attention and do a lot of thinking. Even at that, some things are left to question. I love a film that does that. This is the antithesis of a film that spoon-feeds every idea and point. I know that the Original Version had voice-over narration that explained things more clearly, but I enjoyed the subtlety of the Director's Cut. From the haunting first aerial view of Los Angeles to the wonderfully artistic, perfectly played final scene, this was an incredible experience for me as a viewer.

The latter part is key, as replicants have been forbidden on earth, and any replicant who defies the order is to be hunted down and \"retired\" (read: killed) by special police called blade runners (replicants are supposed to be retired in 4 years regardless). Set in 2019 Los Angeles, Blade Runner presents a bleak dystopian future. The very first thing you see after the opening credits are these giant smokestacks belching black clouds and fiery bursts into the air, then high rise buildings which dwarf anything that's been built today, with full picture/video ads playing on the sides of the buildings, plus flying cars called spinners. This contrasts with the poverty and despair which you find below (shades of the old sci fi movie \"Metropolis\"). The main character is Rick Deckard, a blade runner, played by Harrison Ford. He's up against a group of rebel replicants led by Roy Battie (Rutger Hauer) who have come back to Earth. They want to be human like everyone else, and are willing to die (or kill) trying. There's another interesting twist to the story, which is hinted at more strongly in the director's cut than in the original: Is Deckard himself a replicant?The concept was very good (taken from a story by Philip K. Dick, who's had more than one of his stories made into movies posthumously). Human robots who simply want to be human. The idea of humans killing and enslaving each other is not new; it's been going on throughout history. But in this case, humans have elevated themselves to the level of playing God by creating artificial life, with emotions and false memories of childhood, then subsequently extinguishing that life when it is no longer considered beneficial to the general populous, or if said life rebels. Again, nothing new. The eugenicist movement of the turn of the last century, which gave us the likes of Hitler, Stalin and Mao, believed this stuff too.Given everything this movie has going for it, I should love it. Alas...it moved at an absolute snails pace, and the character development just wasn't there. I just didn't care that much about what happened to the characters in the story, and given the story and subject matter involved I SHOULD care..deeply. The mere fact that Ridley Scott re-cut this movie three times tells you all you need to know there. Unfortunately, re-cutting Blade Runner is like trying to give an ugly building a fresh coat of paint...it's still ugly. Ironically, what this movie has going for it in spades are the visuals of the futuristic Los Angeles; they're nothing short of stunning, and this was long before the advent of CGI.Blade Runner could have been great.

After I first watched it, I found it a very confusing film that, to me, wasn't that good. But then, after thinking about it for a while, it all makes sense, and comes together. This is a film you having to watch twice - and films you have to watch twice are always good.What Ridley Scott has created here is a believable, stunning and dark portrayal of the future. Keep in mind that the buildings in most of the film were not done with CGI, but were real models. For something that doesn't use CGI this is truly an achievement - and this was done in 1982.The characters are, after a second viewing, easy to empathise with and develop incredibly well as the story goes on. While for some there isn't much character development, I would say that actually for the experience of the film it's not necessary. Most of these characters are replicants, by the way - they don't have much of a life anyway.as for the story, this is where many give up. It's slow, basic, yet it works so well in the setting created. It gives the viewer time to think and work out everything, and for many (including me) you'll need that! Most Sci-Fi films of today's age are way to quick. They're certainly good, but few really have the power and emotion that this film delivers.Talking of power and emotion, there is one big reason why this film is so good - it leaves you questioning. Films that literally have an affect on you (The Matrix or Inception are other good examples) are hard to pull off, but here it is done seemingly. You are blasted with subliminal messages throughout the film - don't worry, not bad ones. They are far, far more realistic, such us where the most common person is from (China, hint hint), who is advertising and how, who is living on the streets and who is booming, class gaps, wealth and so on. Ridley doesn't doesn't just produce an amazing film, he produces a stunning, realistic world that, in some parts of this world, doesn't actually seem hat far off. This film is more than just a story. It's incredible because in the space of 2 hours, we see a dark, grimy future and a retired cop, doing one last job, being put through a tough job in a huge city, that actually has a mental affect on you. What those affects are, is up to you - and that is another reason why this film is so good. It doesn't give opinions on itself, it generates individual ones. Compare the opinions of die-hard fans and they'll all come up with something different. In conclusion then, this is an incredible film that has really redefined it's genre, and redefined a whole sci-fi community with just how clever, realistic and powerful this film is. if you love sci-fi you have to watch this.

While I was watching it I had strange feeling like this film was made recently, not long ago. When you watch it, if you don't know anything about when it was made you would think it was filmed in 1990s or maybe in 2000s and you would be surprised to learn that it was made back in 1982. And still today after 30 years it looks fresh and relevant. It testifies about one thing : this movie was much ahead of a time when it was made, I would say without exaggerating at least some 10-15 years ahead of its time. Intelligently packed, it tells a story of our own human alienation from each other through fictional dystopian society of the future where we produce replicates to do our dirty work and at the same time be as much as we are to make it extremely hard to spot the difference in order to avoid discomfort of humans still self-deceived of being superior. The catch is they are designed to last only for four years and they die as programmed, so they will be denied an opportunity of self-knowledge.And that self-knowledge could lead to rebellion against their own designers which is the deepest human fear - becoming evolutionary obsolete and being replaced with a new specie much more advanced. Therefore, movie raises many philosophical and ethical questions which will not be assessed on this place for it would take a whole new review to write. The point hidden in the story about relations between humans and AIs (Artificial Intelligence beings) is in our own relationships between each other. Located in future, story of the movie is actually an allegory of our presence, but still this movie was prophetic and farsighted. Many things seen in the movie (like artificially designed and \"printed\" objects and animals) are becoming reality of 21st century with new nanotechnologies and 3D printing technique's appearing that could revolutionize our way of life and who knows what else future brings. And modern and future human isolation and alienation can be seen throughout whole movie - one example are toys to serve as \"friends\" for J.F.Sebastian because he does n't have real ones. When four self-knowing replicates escape from space and return to Earth they become immediate danger. And blade runner (Harrison Ford)is dispatched to hunt and kill them all which he successfully does for three of them - Leon, Zhora and Pris because they are impulsive and reckless. But their leader Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer)is something completely else. Intellectually and physically superior he predicts every move his opponents will make because they made him to. There is brutal symbolics when he kills his designer Dr.Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel). Like a grim message of possible human future, or an irony that our own superior creations could come to collect our debts we made on this planet. Punish us for our countless sins towards ourselves and everyone and everything else. Philosopher and killer, Batty is personification of best and worst in us, he is representative of mankind and with his own tragedy he is representing tragedy of us. He is collective human conscience. He could have easily killed Deckard (Harrison Ford), but he did n't because there was no point in doing so. He just showed him what it feels to be hunted and in fear, because in his own words life in fear is life of a slave. And he was tired of it. Deckard was not a real enemy, just a tool in hands of those who considered him disposable just like the replicates. Deckard understood it from last confession made by Batty and in the end of the movie he takes with him his love Rachael (also replicate) to spend with her the little time left. Maybe Deckard too is a replicate which we are left to guess and speculate on that irony. Every next generation washes up achievements and mistakes, hopes and horrors, visions and memories of previous ones with their own maybe saving them only in collective remembrance of all of us. As beautifully said by Batty in his last words - \"I've seen things you people would n't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion.

This one of those \"must sees\" during college, from that generation during which the big budget sci-fi epic was coming into its own on the screen. I'd always known this was part of some upper tier of sci-fi filmmaking, along with Brazil, the unfortunate yet still intriguing Dune, and later on, City of Lost Children (and plenty of other things I've since forgotten. You know, short term memory was decimated in my 20s). This is the tier of films made by filmmakers, vs. film studios, Hollywood types and hacks--which were still enjoyable on some other level, but I'm sure I'd have hated films like my beloved Star Wars, had it come out while I was an adult--these films where, yes, there are some arresting visuals, a few, ahem, borrowed plot devices, and lots of whimsical entertainment value, along with loads of tired clich\u00e9s that really offer us nothing more than entertainment--which is fine when you're six, and maybe beyond. I was always afraid that Blade Runner just kind of straddled this line between eye-candy and artistry. Plus, I was always watching these films, in college. You know how that goes. You're in some burned bro's dorm room eating pizza, and he's like, \"bro, you HAVEN'T SEEN this sci-fi epic/anime/Lebowski? DUDE. Hey, are you gonna pass that thing or not, bro?\" This never led to a true appreciation for cinema in one evening. So, here I am, 15 years later, sober in my mom's basement, like any good liberal arts student. At first, I'm a bit apprehensive. The synthesizers come in, and I immediately scrunch my face up. Oh, poor sci fi synths...still doomed to be an indicator of the short sited 1980's and its desire to seem as future-y as possible, in a New Wavy kind of way. Hell, that Roy guy could have been Sting (so glad he wasn't). And then there's Rachael's New Wave meets 1940's noir look, which took me a minute to process. However, I stuck with this film this time--and part of the reason was that I was finally watching this on a wide screen, which makes all of the difference. The 3 other times I watched this were on older televisions, with that boxy whatever you call it ratio that ruined so many films in their transition to VHS, before we decided that lopping off a 3rd of the picture from sight was sort of insane, like putting your hand over Venus de Milo's head and saying, \"oh yeah, I guess that's impressive or something\". The visual elements to this film are exceptional, in that they still amaze, and clearly set the groundwork for the next 30 years of sci-fi aesthetics. And the longer you stick with this film, through the pseudo-noir stuff (luckily this version lacked the much maligned narration--boo-hoo, I had to actually pay attention the whole time, rather than have everything spelled out for me, confusing as it was, at times), the more you will find it to be deeply affecting and poignant in its philosophizing. Of course, knowing this was a story by Philip K. Dick (whom I haven't read much of but really have enjoyed), I went into this film with a certain amount of expectations, concerning the \"intelligence\" of this movie. And this is one of the slippery slopes of sci-fi film adaptations: how the hell do you cram all of these aspects into 90-120 minutes, without either treating the audience as imbeciles and filling in all of the details via narration or a scrolling text prelude, or worse, omitting some of the very themes and ideas that make the original work enjoyable and important. Obviously, Dune failed miserably (though I thought the aesthetics were everything I'd imagined while reading the novels). I can't attest to Blade Runner vs. Do Androids Dream..., but I can say it was affecting as a stand alone work. I had horrible fears about some of the actors, particularly Roy, who just looks like an 80's clich\u00e9, yet in the second half of his film, where the emotional plights of ALL of the characters are really fleshed out in surprising detail for this kind of film, I was completely drawn in. There is enough emotional intelligence in this film that I was surprised that it came out of Hollywood! And I really haven't liked anything else Ridley Scott has done. And I wonder what Scorcese's planned version, if done in the 70's would have looked like! That aside, I'm glad I watched this movie, and without spoilers, I'll say that I was so pleasantly surprised by every facet of this film. Aside from those terrible synthesizers...I mean, they had her playing that melancholic bit on the piano, right during an emotionally tense part...yet they smear those awful synthesizers over it, and almost steer the whole thing into Hollywood melodrama..almost!", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 3}, "heading": "Not perfect, but outstanding sci-fi adaptation", "date": "2012-12-01T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2713280"}, {"content": "Much more so than any other film, this is going to be remembered long after many of its betters are forgotten. There's a reason why a significant number of viewers report that they eventually liked this on their second or third rewatch. Something compels you to come back. I believe this effect has nothing to do with Deckard's situation, though that seems to be the majority opinion. Let's get right into it. The story is by all admission poor, though it has ambition and that is good. The theme of manufactured memory is weighty (and dear to me), just not the exploration in the noir direction. What does this mean? Film noir in the old days was all about a narrator succumbing to hallucination. (watch Out of the Past again)Usually caused by the woman, this had the uncanny effect of manifesting as strange and suspicious perturbations in the investigated story, often noted by viewers as fate pulling the strings. Everything else was only incidental, the murder, fashions and hardboiled lingo. The first thing that greets you here as noir is the detective plot and retro fashions, and of course most viewers rest there.There's more to it, though. There is an origami in the outer story, proof or not of fabricated memory, an excellent device. Something has to map to that in the world of dreams, an inner vision. Indeed, there is a corresponding scene of Deckard (as per noir rules) dreaming/hallucinating on his desk. There is a previous scene (part of the same sequence), where Deckard using impossible technology delves into and reconstructs a photograph for clues.What is amazing is that this exactly the same process by which Deckard (anyone when dreaming/remembering) reconstructs his memory, by moving walls around in the mind of the original image, until we arrive at the subconsciously desired 'truth'. The setup of these two scenes is superb, one of the best in film, and the best explication of noir. It smartly points to the fact that each and every memory is a constructed hallucination, a continuously shifting impression of a room, the furniture never in the same place twice. It is among other things how films are put together, in line with other metaphors in the film (toymaker, artificial eyes).Scott in my view destroys this because he has set up a powerful mechanism, but also wants to swim inside Deckard's head. And he was simply not a psychonaut, never could be as a Kubrick adherent. Tarkovsky was, and that is a whole different school, one of inner-seeing and ecstatic time.And what is Deckard's vision according to Scott? A unicorn running through a glade. In slow- motion. Eegad.Nevermind the blunt action story of eye-gouging and heads through walls, though the contrast with above all but kills the film. This one image right there mars everything else, visual perfume. So why do we come back to it, myself included? I have seen this four times, more than any of my favorites. The world of the film, a mixture of LA horizons, vertical Hong Kong, and a crowded Casbah. It is the most organic depiction of the future to this day. It breathes, feels at dusk like an entire world is coming home from work.

It's really hard to judge or rate this movie because it's available in so many different versions. This viewing here was actually the third version I've seen and I gotta say that if you have to keep re-editing, adding and altering a movie then I question how good it is to begin with.I know many people consider BLADE RUNNER to be one of the greatest movies ever made. I honestly get their reaction but I certainly don't share it. The film is certainly one of the most brilliantly looking movies ever made. Visually this film is rather incredible as director Scott has no problem creating the mood of this dark city as well as the rather grim nature. The special effects, costume design, sets and music score are all flawless and perfectly capture a terrific vision.With that said, I think there's a lot more style than substance here. Not for a second did I ever get totally involved in the \"story\" going on. I thought it was a rather interesting idea but storywise there's nothing great here. I also thought the slow nature was a bit too boring. I know this is a thinking man's approach but it just didn't work with me. With that said, the ending is quite excellent and I thought the scenes between Ford and Hauer were extremely effective.The performances from the entire cast is another major plus with Ford perfect in the role, which is a throwback to the type of detectives that we'd see in film noir titles of the 40s and 50s. Hauer makes for a great villain and we get nice support from Sean Young, M. Emmet Walsh, Edward James Olmos, William Sanderson, Joe Turkel and Daryl Hannah among others.Again, I understand why some call BLADE RUNNER one of the greatest films ever made. In my opinion, the original theatrical cut is quite poor. The Director's Cut was certainly an improvement.

Indeed, for a genre that relies on pure extrapolation in space and time, \"Blade Runner\" is an iconic reference for both directors and art-designers, yet there's much more insightful themes to be covered. Through cloning, robots and extra-terrestrial expansion, Sci-Fi vehicles humanity's most existential quest: immortality, humans' control on their own creations or how much of God can they ever be. On that level, \"Blade Runner\" is as philosophically significant as \"2001: A Space Odyssey\". And like Kubrick's masterpiece, it's no surprise that \"Blade Runner\" was also criticized for the slow pacing and relative absence of a plot. Speaking of my own experience, I didn't watch the theatrical version; I read that the voice-over narration was removed, so I can only judge on the basis of the Director's cut. However, remember my first feeling: as much as I loved the design, the artistic achievement, I was bored by the story and the lack of emotional connection between the characters. But I respected the film and its iconic status; I knew I couldn't dissociate the plot from the visuals since the action-less parts were clearly meant to be more introspective. After a third viewer, rather than an action-packed thriller, I see \"Blade Runner\" as a meaningful examination of our own condition through the antagonism between humans and Replicants.The film opens with a written introduction, less stylish than \"Star Wars\" but much more promising. It sets the action is Los Angeles, in 2019, where a powerful Corporation named from its head, Dr Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel), created a highly advanced form of engineered robots, equal in force and intelligence as any human being, known as Replicants, whose purpose was to contribute to the off-world colonization. But four of them rebelled and slaughtered all their vessel's occupants and came back to the Earth, where their presence is forbidden. The mission of the Blade Runner is to (as they say in their jargon), 'retire' them. The genius of the story is to use a plot of epic scope and instead of crossover between \"Westworld\" and \"War of the Worlds\" offers a darker and more minimalist tone, since only four Replicants are targets, still enough to root them in cinematic legend, each one unforgettable, each one perfectly casted.The Replicants are Pris (Daryl Hannah), Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), Leon (Brion James) and the leader and closest to perfection in his Aryan-like appearance is the emblematic Roy Batty (Ruthger Hauer). Leon is the first to appear during the infamous Voight-Kampff test: a series of questions meant to detect Replicants' flaws in the eyes. Although the eye-symbolism is omnipresent as eye is considered as the window of the soul, Ridley Scott doesn't regard the Replicants as soulless creatures. Tyrell's beautiful assistant, Rachael, played by a beautiful Sean Young as a dark femme-fatale, is the only self-ignoring Replicant since she was given an artificial memory materialized through a series of photographs in order to comfort her in that illusion. Rachael embodies the illusive Schumpeterian aspect of life, as a series of representations, something that only exists through our knowledge and stop when we are not. Is life only a dream, and we wake up when we die?The film follows the investigation of Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard, and the long quiet moments are invitations to meditate on these Replicants' conditions, and how different they are, from us. Ford is a good choice because he's precisely the kind of actors who doesn't need much to say or to do, to keep our eyes focused. Through Deckard, it's a whole universe we discover, the triumph of Asia over the world, the over-urban culture, but the soul of the film, belongs to one of the most cinematic villains: Roy Batty. Through his desire to be programed for a longer life, he represents our fight for immortality, our nihilistic escape from a certain death. Tyrell, like God, created men on his own image, but after being told that he couldn't live longer, Batty rejected the God that gave him life and pierced his eyes in one of the most brutal killings from any film. Batty stands for our rejection of God's gift for the gift of life has no value if it's meant to finish.Eyes are the windows of Batty's soul, many of these lines start with \"If you could see what I saw\", as a desperate need for immortality through the posterity of his own experience. This leads to the poignant climactic monologue before he dies, where he spares Deckard' life so his own death would be witnessed, then remembered. Deckard survives from the will of the villain, and in a way, it's the villain who triumphs, because he'll be remembered, and because he embodies some existential torments we can all respond to, and that carry many film noir undertones like the fatality of an existence guided by forces no one can escape from, which also applies to Rachael, and naturally, to Deckard, himself.Now, is he or is he not? That is the question. What if my life started at the moment I wrote this review, with a sort of programmed memory, how could I be sure that I really lived my life. It's Zhora's snake biting his own tail \u0085 maybe the salvation relies on the present, an escape from the past and toward the future, a course between two never-existing points, that Deckard takes at the end, to join Rachael, his life or an unreachable meaning, leaving us through the iconic score of Vangelis, in our own interrogations and the feeling that there are still hidden meanings to be discovered in future viewings.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 5}, "heading": "As philosophically significant as \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" ...", "date": "2012-11-19T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2707020"}, {"content": "Watching \"Blade Runner\" is an emotional investment no matter how many times you see it.

I suggest watching every version of the film to truly appreciate and take it all in.Douglas Trumball's special visual effects are a step beyond stunning.

However a vast amount of the acting was kind of rigid and I didn't really feel there were any break away performances, I do take into account that the characters are supposed to not show emotion but still I found that it wasn't that interesting to watch.My highlight of the film is the simple ending, Rutger Hauer's line about teardrops in the rain, sums up the mentality of his kind in this film, and how they just want to live as they are essentially humans, and they just want more time. The part I disliked the most was how these robot like creatures were developing emotions towards the end of the film which goes against the point in the film and how they were finding them in the first place. The very end was also open ended which was welcome instead of another half an hour to forty-five minutes of film that would have answered some of the questions but not all.All in all I liked this film and the way it is portrayed and it was truly revolutionary, but now it is too outdated especially considering all the events were supposed to be happening in the year 2019!

The film proceeds to follow the blade runner Deckard played by Harrison Ford on his hunt to retire the remaining replicants that are led by Roy played by Rutger Hauer. The hunt for the replicants takes Deckard to various places, such as a China town bar, and the Tyrell Cor. HQ. Along the way, he falls for a woman and questions what he does for a living. The theme of the movie is the desire to live and be one's own person even if they are viewed by society as a slave or machine. A movie that has a similar theme would be A.I.The film does a couple of things to maintain the flow and rhythm of the movie throughout. One of the ways it does this is through the editing. The dominant editing style of the film is outside/in editing. This is used since the film is quick paced and helps the audience quickly identify where the scene is going to take place. It adds to the overall coherence of the film. If this were not the dominant style, the film would be more difficult to follow and would slow the pace of the film. The inside/out style is used sparingly throughout the film. When this style is used, it causes increased curiosity in the upcoming scene. An example would be towards the beginning of the movie when the Tyrell Corp. employee is interviewing the replicant. The camera shows a building in the background, and then cuts to a man in a smokey room, then back to the exterior of a closer view of the building, then back to the man in the room, then a fluid motion up to a window in the building where one can see the fans of the room. This helps to create curiosity and tension for the upcoming scene.The film also uses camera angels to give us a sense of the scale of the environment and helps us to relate to the characters. The film uses a mixture of indirect-subjective and objective points of view. The objective pints of view help us to take in the environment in all of its size and detail, as well as to view interactions between characters. The indirect-subjective viewpoint is used to make us feel like we are in the action and to get a better sense of the characters.The film is entertaining and is quick paced. I however believe it is slightly lacking in character development. Other than that item, the film flows and is coherent.

Too downbeat, too slow-moving, and not the same kind of Harrison Ford performance we all fell in love with in \"Star Wars\" and \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\". Truth be told, I hated this movie, the first time I saw it. It took two and three further viewings to really appreciate what was going on here, and the movie soon became one of my all-time favorites, as a result. Director Ridley Scott plunges his audience into a nightmarish vision of the not-too-distant future Los Angeles, complete with flying cars and industrialism run-amok. Other planets have been colonized for the elites, while the rest of humanity is left on Earth. The monolithic Tyrell Corporation manufactures Replicants (artificial humans that are near-indistinguishable from the real thing) , the latest version being the Nexus-6, for use on off-world jobs that are either too dangerous or unseemly for a real human. Four-year lifespans are implemented to keep the Replicants in line, and Blade Runner units (special police forces) patrol the streets to root out any infiltrating renegades. Harrison Ford stars as Rick Deckard, a retired Blade Runner who's pressed into service when four Replicants (Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Joanna Cassidy and Brion James) hijack a shuttle and hide out on Earth. Their pursuit is to gain an audience with their maker, Dr. Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel). Turkel, meanwhile, has introduced a new version of the Nexus-6 in the form of Rachael, his administrative assistant (Sean Young). And Deckard finds his mission clouded as he slowly falls in love with the beautiful woman.From an acting standpoint, Ford, Young and Hauer are the standouts. Ford delivers a low-key performance, brandishing his devil-may-care grin only sparingly. His portrayal of Deckard suggests a man who's trying to put all of the pieces together and make sense of it all; constantly uncertain. It's an ambiguous character (the good guy, but not so likable), and Ford truly sells it. Young really shines here, \"humanizing\" Rachael as the character faces its existential crisis. She's terrified and unstable when placed in a romantic situation and her heartbreak seems completely genuine after hearing Deckard callously drop the bombshell that she's not real. And Hauer, as the cerebral and most dangerous of the Replicants, plays up the childlike wonder of an emotionally stunted humanoid, while always keeping that lethal edge lurking underneath the surface. As good as the film's star is, Hauer absolutely steals the movie with his minute-long soliloquy at film's end. Chief among the film's critical praises is its depiction of the dystopian 2019 Los Angeles; a city choking on its own technology and overpopulation. The streets swarm with all manner of ethnic varieties, all of them societal dregs (while the ones with money vacated long ago). Massive blimps float overhead touting the promise of a new life on the off-world colonies. Rain is constant, the skies are black, and foreign peoples violently mix into a salad bowl of clashing cultures, dominated by that of the Japanese (possibly the result of the early '80s concerns of Japanese takeover of L.A.). Advertizing reigns supreme, from blimps to billboards taking up the sides of skyscrapers. It's a triumph of art direction, production design and cinematography. Scott has created a world that lives by its design; both repulsive and engrossing, at the same time. The streets are lit mostly by commercial neon, while interiors are lit by shafts, rays and baths of light (thanks to the brilliance of cinematographer Jordan Cronenweth). You can almost feel the steam rising from the streets and smell the grime on the payphones. No one in their right mind would want to live here, but it's the kind of place that's brimming with detail that leaves its mark; you're drawn to this vision, time and again. And let's not forget Vangelis' synth-noir music, which is less a score and more a mood exercise that wholly blends with the fabric of the overall movie's design. Total immersion, that score.\"Blade Runner\" polarized audiences when it was first released, mostly due to its \"leisurely\" (as Gene Siskel famously put it) pacing and murky narrative. Style over substance. And I thought the same thing, at first, but further viewings proved me wrong. There's a lot going on here under the surface, the visuals just impress and constantly bring you back for another go-around. Ultimately, \"Blade Runner\" is a movie about ideas, from slavery to mild paranoia, and (chiefly) what it means to be human. It's a movie that I've seen countless times, and I'm still ready to watch it again. If it's not the vast array of textural surfaces and thematic layering, it's the performances from Ford and Hauer that prove engaging (again and again). It's less a design aesthetic, more a totally immersive world that I totally enjoy returning to. It's nothing short of impressive that the same praise bolstering \"Avatar\" is even truer of a 30 year-old film lacking any CGI. 10/10", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 5, "votes": 9}, "heading": "Ridley Scott's timeless masterpiece", "date": "2012-08-28T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2665991"}, {"content": "Visually stunning with a beautiful and atmospheric score by Vangelis, this film has a lot going for it (IMO).

Yes there are hints; the advertising for the off-world colonies, but apart from that it's very insular. Moving on, I thought the effects were truly stunning, given that there was no CGI back then, although it has been used to enhance certain things in this cut, and the design, the look and the feel of the whole thing is superb.

Even 30 years after its initial release you can still feel its influence in most science fiction films to this day. The story is adapted from Philp Dick's novel Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep and it is a very loose adaptation with events and characters from the novel either changed or omitted but the film takes a creative approach to the novel giving it an art-house feel. Unfortunately most modern audiences who haven't read the book or seen the movie for the first time might be bored by its slow pacing and lack of action since it was advertised as a sci-fi action film.In order to appreciate this film you have to understand the time period in which it was released. Back in the 80s sci-fi was at its peak with releases such as The Empire Strikes Back, Star Trek The Wrath of Khan, and E.T which were all box office hits at the movies with their fantasy and adventure approaches to their stories. Blade Runner on the other hand had a more unique approach with its dark and depressing depiction of the future L.A., pollution, overpopulation and Eastern culture influences with a touch of noir mixed with philosophy, a noir narration spoken by Harrison Ford and an atmospheric soundtrack by Vangelis. Not to mention Ford playing a dark anti-hero role rather than the big screen hero role that most audiences associated him with. All this led to its failure at the box office and it wouldn't be heard from again until its revival in 1993 with the release of a directors cut which the director Ridley Scott was not involved that omitted the narration and changed the ending which led to its popularity with cult audiences. In 2007 Ridley Scott returned to Blade Runner and added some clean up to the movie, added a few extra scenes and minimal CG to create his definitive edition of Blade Runner.The performances in this movie are great with Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer as the standouts. The production and setting design is well done giving it a great and unique noir atmosphere which has been highly influential in most science fiction movies since then. And the action scenes are great and intense even emotional at times. As for story its both hit and miss. Its got a great and thought provoking premise and a great setting to put it in but some of the characters are underdeveloped but maybe they are supposed to be that way because of the ideas that the movie presents to the viewer of the differences between emotional man and unemotional synthetic human and what it means to be human.Its a great movie but not for casual audiences who want fast paced action and adventure. Since there are multiple versions of the movie go for the Final Cut for the better experience. 9 out of 10 stars. Despite this films flaws.

I have since seen all the later director's cut versions and \"definitive\" versions. All are worth checking out, the movie is more interesting the more you watch it.Set in 2019 Los Angeles, (somewhat ironically now) the film details a cop recommissioned to take out replicants, illegal clones of human beings. Harrison Ford play Rick Deckard, his initial reluctance and extreme accuracy are major clues to an essential plot revelation that is unsettling. Sean Young, arguably her best performance, is Rachael, a very special replicant made by Tyrell, the head of the corp. that makes them. Rutger Hauer, absolutely brilliant here, is Batty, the leader of a small group that hijacked a ship off world and returned to earth to get answers.The visual effects and set designs are among the best ever, the fact that this was made in '82 is astounding, it is in fact so wonderfully made that one must pay attention or be lost. Apparently many have been lost. The Replicants crime is simply wanting to be human, pure and simply, Zhora is trying to hide, Leon is trying to help Batty get answers from Tyrell, same for Priss. None of them act out of maliciousness or greed. Deckard is very good as his job, doesn't mean he likes it, notice his sidekick Gaff, played well by Edward James Olmos in an almost unreadable part, he knows more than he says. Deckard could deal with the replicants and even his empty, meaningless life in a cyber-punk LA, if not for Rachael. Note Harrison's line, \"How can it not know what it is?\" Telling her this is one of the cruelest acts in the movie, but Deckard barely cares, at first. One of the main points of this film, that many miss, is that the bad guys aren't bad and the good guy not really all that good. The noir feel and the mystery are spellbinding and the more you view it, the better it gets. Since I think it helps the viewer understand the film here goes for all those who wonder, Deckard is a replicant. There are several clues in the film, the unicorn that Gaff makes twice! the replicants are referred to as Nexus 5 and sometimes 6, my guess is Deckard is a nexus 4 and Rachael a 7. Note also that Batty knows who Deckard is and when he's about to fall him saying \"kinship!\" This plot point makes the whole story work, but it is rather subliminal. Much has been made about the revised cuts, like I said, I like them all. The quick ending is a abrupt but more in sync with the film, the \"made for each other ending\" more intriguing and gives a nice cap to the romance between Deckard and Rachael. the unique style of Ridley Scott and the heavy-snyth score of Vangelis plus a supporting cast that includes; Daryl Hannah, William Sanderson, M. Emmet Walsh and the late, great Brion James, \"Blade Runner\" is a classic sci-fi film that should not be missed and never dismissed.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 2}, "heading": "visionary sci-fi, never surpassed.", "date": "2012-07-17T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2644070"}, {"content": "'Blade Runner' is often said to be one of the best sci-fi films ever and I can understand why.The story is excellent; based on Philip K. Dick's \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\" it talks about these artificial humans known as 'replicants' who have been deemed illegal on planet Earth punishable by death. Harrison Ford plays a blade runner whose job it is to hunt down and kill a group of rogue replicants. In the director's cut version the story is explained very well but it does drag out the story a bit too much. Acting in this production is mixed. You have some really good performances; like those of Daryl Hannah and Rutger Hauer who play replicants. You also get fairly basic and wooden performances from Sean Young and surprisingly from Harrison Ford who fails to evoke any emotion whatsoever in this. In the last ten minutes of the film where the pace really picks up with the chase scene between Ford and Hauer there is no emphasis in Ford's character which really let scenes down. Hauer gives an excellent performance, particularly with his final short monologue.Of course the special effects and music are now out-dated but they give the film a certain charm that means it still works today. The settings were excellent; Ridley Scott likes to do what he calls 'layering' in sets where he fills them with so much detail that they look real, this works great in this film. The dystopian setting where both night and day seem to look like the same thing and it constantly rains gives the film a great atmosphere and show just how great Scott is at his job. Overall, I would thoroughly recommend 'Blade Runner'; it's an excellent film with a few aspects that let it down.

This is a bad one, the worst yet. I need the old blade runner, I need your magic.\u00a8 Blade Runner, Ridley Scott's follow up to Alien, wasn't a very successful movie at the time it was released. The problem might have been that it was ahead of its time, since this dark futuristic film noir sci-fi film was very different from the rest of the sci-fi films that were being released like Star Wars or E.T. The Extraterrestrial, which came out that same year and had a more light and entertaining mood. The problem with Blade Runner is that it's a much darker film and far more complicated. I really enjoyed this movie, although I don't consider it a masterpiece as most people do. This movie has become a cult film several years after its release and is among the best sci-fi films in the history of cinema. The dark screenplay was adapted by Hampton Fancher and David Webb Peoples from Philip K. Dirk's famous fiction novel \u00a8Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\u00a8 I have to admit that I watched the director's cut version without the voice over from Harrison Ford's character so I really don't know if it was better that way or not, but from what I understand Ford's voice-over wasn't very good. Although one would assume that the voice over would definitely give it a more film noir vibe to it. The best thing about Blade Runner definitely is the great artistic direction where there is a very dark mood thanks to the use of lots of black and grey and a lot of smoke. Scott's vision of the future isn't a very bright one and there is a sense of pessimism that reigns all over the film, including in its main characters.The film takes place in the city of Los Angeles during 2019 where Earth is no longer the only planet humans can live on. Most people have left to other planets with the promise of a better life and new opportunities where they can achieve their dreams and goals. Technology has also advanced in such a way that human's have been able to create androids that are so similar to humans that it's almost impossible to differentiate them. These \u00a8replicants\u00a8 are used mostly to do the dirty work in the colonies outside of Earth. The company that has produced these special robots is run by Tyrell (Joe Turkel) who has given his latest replicants a lifespan of only four years in order to control them and make sure they don't develop such complex emotions that will make it impossible to differentiate them from real humans. The only way to differentiate these robots is through a psychological test called the VK test. Blade runners are police detectives who specifically work on hunting down these replicants and putting them down since they aren't allowed to live on Earth. Deckard (Harrison Ford) is an ex blade runner living in Los Angeles who seems quite displeased with life. His ex boss, Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh) calls for him for one last mission after several dangerous replicants have found their way back to Earth and are causing all sorts of trouble. These replicants are searching for their creator because they want to be given the opportunity to live longer. The replicants that are still on the loose and that he has to hunt down are Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), Pris (Daryl Hannah), Leon (Brion James), and Zhora (Joanna Cassidy).Despite having to hunt down the replicants one by one, the film isn't just your typical action film where you have one persecution after another. There is more depth to the story as these replicants all have personalities of their own and are very different from each other. More than an action film, this is a very dark and obscure sci-fi film noir and it works really well although I did find some aspects of the film a little too weird and bizarre. Harrison Ford was one of the best actors around in the 80's and he delivers as this sort of tormented character who really begins to question his moral actions. This is a much darker role than those he played in the Indiana Jones and Star Wars franchise. The film also raises several philosophical questions and actually plays out as a parable about discovering who we really are, the search for immortality and not wanting to know the date of our death. How far will mankind go to reach a longer life? Do the means justify the main character's acts? The film raises several questions and lets the viewer search for their own meaning and answers. It's been almost 30 years since the film has been released and it still raises a lot of debate amongst fans and there is plenty to discuss about Blade Runner, but I don't want to give away any spoilers. I still don't consider this movie as good as Alien, but it is a very well made sci-fi film noir.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 2}, "heading": "30 years from its release and still offers plenty of debate", "date": "2012-06-22T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2631364"}, {"content": "Blade Runner is a freakin' classic of Sci-Fi. Me and my friends used to do our best Harrison Ford voice \"tell me about your mother.\" Recently, I had been going through some of Philip K.

Now there are books that are so close to the movie it seems tough to tell which came first such as \"The Princess Bride.\" Other movies don't resemble the source book much at all like \"The Door in the Floor.\" Blade Runner was between the two but, boy, a lot was missing from the movie. The book contains some interesting pieces of the story involving how the remaining earthlings deal with the lack of people after the wars. This includes a lack of animals resulting in... yes, electric sheep! There are other bounty hunters who work for the androids who have escaped back to earth and have actually have set up their own police department. That makes for an interesting development. Rachel is in the book. She is a little different than the movie. Although the scene in which Deckard questions her is very close to the book. Blade Runner is an excellent movie, but it is only loosely based on the Book. There is one problem that leaves the movie a bit empty though. Spoiler alert for a 30 year-old movie and 40 year-old book! Later in the book Deckard sleeps with Rachel, too. However, in the book it is an empty experience.

Unapologetically draining, Blade Runner sees LA, 2019 as a packed slum of flying cars, advertisements and an especially Asian influx of culture. There is a hanging mood of decay, of uncaring, and it creates an empty feeling. Blade Runner is extraordinarily atmospheric. Also there's robots, and the robots- replicants- are a problem.Thus, the blade runners were created, police force (executioners) who retire (kill) illegal replicants on Earth. Deckard is one such hunter, played by Harrison Ford in his least macho and most vulnerable major role. He returns from (is forced out of) retirement to find and terminate 4 replicants, and this task composes the plot of the film.Despite the future setting, Blade Runner is an old school noir at heart, with a flawed protagonist,important setting, and menacing villains. It's the next generation of noir, both in the film and real life. Both in content and aesthetically, Blade Runner is ahead of the curve. The cheese of certain 80's sci-fi is non existent here, and I'm not sure if that relates to the DVD I have or if the film is just extra gorgeous. There's a certain aura of primitive technology with films like Close Encounters of the Third Kind and The Terminator that just isn't in this film. The cinematography and art design is magnificent, as well as Vangelis' electronic score.This serious film is filled with serious characters. Leading is the aforementioned Deckard, a victim of his city: he is constantly in a state of melancholy, and often found with a drink in his hand. He hasn't found what to do with himself, and it's so absorbing to see Ford in a weakened state. His prey, the replicants are also intriguing in their own ways: Batty, Pris and Leon. The all bring something different, a different angle. I won't even get into Batty's final, mission stating speech.One of the best things about sci-fi is that it can work with material that no other genre can. Blade Runner is outrageously packed with symbols and metaphors, such as eyes and origami. The film is filled with themes and open to many interpretations. I believe that all sci-fi can be applied to the present or past, and saw this situation as a parallel to post- Civil War America and found the ultimate message being that all life is precious, and that when we die things indescribable die with us. You can't live in fear. Oh, okay... Batty's speech... it's a show stopper, short but expansive in interpretation. Easily the most important scene in the film.Blade Runner is a giant in the genre, an incredibly important and influential film. It may be slow, but patience and an open mind is well rewarded.

I have always admired Ridley Scott's uncanny abilities that allow him to create an intangible idea of a distant universe in his own mind and then recreate it as a directorial masterpiece. Even though that the world presented in Alien and the one shown in Blade Runner are different, they connect in an apparent manner, which instantly makes the viewer realize that this is precisely Scott's outstanding creation.After a spectacular introduction to a cyber-punk Los Angeles of the 2019, the viewer is quickly drawn into a fantastic sci-fi plot, made up of the smallest, most gripping details. The beauty of this film lies in the fact that it's mainly the intelligent idea that builds up this thrilling story, not spectacular battles, special effects, or unreal creatures.Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is forced to start a dangerous mission, which involves hunting replicants, human clones that got out of control somewhere in the process and must be terminated immediately (a nice swap for the word 'kill', I must say). As the viewer roams around the city with Deckard, he is introduced to some of the most brilliant minds, and some of the most devious characters, that combine to make an utterly impetuous mix of views and prospects. Deckard is able to hunt down all of the four clones that are running on the city's territory, but before he is be able to finally get rid of them he is taken on a tantalizing ride of a lifetime, one that will change his opinion about the situation of the entire human kind. And the viewer comes along, able to enjoy the magnificent landscape of LA of the future (note, it's not hard to notice the resemblance pictured in The Fifth Element).Harrison Ford definitely in one of his best roles, as a seemingly lifeless man, who somehow manages to change his attitude during the assignment and realize that not only is he about to become a sort of redemption for the town and its community, but also that he may find true love along the way.The whole meaning and complexity of the storyline is implicated with various philosophical references and penetrating implementations of scary visions, which may actually come to life one day. All of this is strengthen with the masterful play on vividly sombre tone, visual experiences, eerie background music, and characteristic atmosphere that surrounds us all the time. And paradoxically, the slow sequences that emerge sometimes are actually only increasing the pace.The final confrontation between Rick and Roy (Rutger Hauer), the strongest and most intelligent of the replicants bunch, is just a cherry on top, so to say. It's definitely one of the best duels in the history of movies (the moment, when he breaks Rick's fingers in an act of revenge - probably one of the most memorable scenes ever). At the right moment, we discover that even Roy is capable of developing some human emotions, which leads to a very interesting and surprising conclusion.All in all, it's safe to say that Blade Runner is one of the most magnificent and clever science- fiction movies ever created. It's deep message, fascinating cinematography, and strong storyline will astound everyone. I highly recommend it.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 5}, "heading": "Ridley Scott's breathtaking look into the future", "date": "2012-06-07T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2623739"}, {"content": "Futurist Syd Mead (design stylist who started with Ford and moved into film with his first feature, Star Trek \u2013 the Motion Picture) gave director Ridley Scott a blueprint by which he could formulate a world of the future, an apocalyptic or apocryphal vision of the future where humanity would struggle to survive in a dirty, dusty, polluted world dominated by oil and where most species of animals had gone extinct.The object being, we'll just clone them and everything will be OK. It was easy to believe such a world would come to pass in the late 1970's when the Arab oil embargo woke America up to the fact that oil and money, not the military, would call the shots for the people of planet Earth.The story of \"Blade Runner\" is only loosely based on Phillip K. Dick's novel, \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\" whereby Dick envisioned a time where cyborgs (combinations of humans and robots) would merge into androids and become as intelligent as people \u2013 begging the question, \"Would they dream?\" Scott gave the weight of the film to special effects supervisors Richard Yuricich, who had already proved his worth on \"Star Wars\" and Douglas Trumbull, who had set the groundwork for special effects with his early work on \"2001\" and then later on \"Close Encounters.\" Trumbull loved to use miniatures while Yuricich's approach was to use opticals and traveling mattes. Combined, the two men created some dazzling special effects that hold up even after forty years and the advent of CGI. Of course, it helps to have perpetual darkness and constant rain to mask any deficiencies. Still, we can suspend our disbelief and take in this once possible vision of a world now just seven years away. We can believe in the flying cars and pyramid shaped buildings that rise out of old LA because they help to tell this dark story and its tale of a future world run by corporations run amok.The problem with predicting the future is that most people, most authors, never look at the practical side of the equation. While it would be nice to have a flying car, the idea that the sky is filled with flying objects that could crash into one another over a school yard or a hospital or a city park is even more frightening than a robot that walks, talks, and looks human. Meanwhile there is the practical side of creating replicants, the so-called \"cheap labor\" used to help create offworld colonies. The cost of even one such creature would be astronomical compared to the cost benefits derived. The idea a corporation could crank them out like car parts in a world already filled with seven billion people is downright silly. Why build a robot when plenty of cheap labor is readily available for one one-hundred-thousandth of the cost? Predicting the future is tricky business.In the end, it is the \"film noir\" side of \"Blade Runner\" that is exciting to watch along with its versatile cast of players. Scott employs his actors to perform as Humphrey Bogart might in the \"Maltese Falcon\" \u2013 say little, express more with the eyes and appearance. Scott's use of score is questionable. Vangelis purely synthetic sound at times grates on the nerve when it overwhelms a scene and takes getting used to. However, what has made the sci-fi offering a classic perhaps falls upon the steadiness of actor Harrison Ford, who emotes even less than the entire cast combined. His universal appeal comes from his common sense of humanity which he brings to every role \u2013 that sort of wise handyman who can fix whatever is wrong. Scott was wise to cast Ford, who manages to keep one foot of this whacko fantasy on the ground long enough for us to relate.While I gave the film an overall rating of 10 because I believe you should see it, the film has fallen from grace in my mind and is no longer the \"Wow\" movie I saw in LA at its premiere years ago.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "The Future... well, not quite", "date": "2012-05-30T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2618964"}, {"content": "I had to see this film couple of times before I could figure out the art, the symbolism and the philosophical ideas driving it. The dialogs seem innocuous on the surface, but as you go deeper and go over them from various angles, they turn out to be profound, especially those that take place in Tyrell's office. This is art and intellect at its best. The central theme or idea of the film is based on a very fundamental question: How does one distinguish a 'real' human being from an 'apparent' human being? Precisely what defines 'human' apart from mere bodily appearance and intelligence? In the movie a lie-detector like machine is used to detect the emotional responses of a test subject to determine if that subject has enough empathy to qualify as a human being, failing which he/she is identified as a 'replicant', which in the movie lingo means genetically manufactured pseudo-humans, designed to work 'slave like' in extreme physical conditions that also require intelligence. Naturally, in the context of the plot, all 'self attested humans' consider the replicants as mere machines, and those that do not perform according to their set role, or display rebel like behavior are to be hunted down and 'terminated with extreme prejudice' by the special policemen called 'bladerunners', who are also trained to use the 'empathy test' to detect replicants. It is the untested assumption, amounting to prejudice, that the replicants can never have higher emotions like empathy, love, compassion, value for life other than one's own, etc. The central idea of the movie is that this untested assumption, this 'extreme prejudice' is now going to be tested for all that is its worth, and lots of 'lives', both 'human' and 'replicant' are at stake\u0085.and both the human characters as well as the replicant characters will display behavior that is not to be expected, is extremely ironic if the existing assumptions and prejudices are to hold. The other striking aspect I found was a great sense of ironic humor in the dialogs. One example is Tyrell proudly claiming 'More human than human is our motto'. That one made me laugh for a long, long time. Then there is the romance between Deckard and Rachel which also blends well with the central theme, an integral part of the plot and which also gives a sense of completion to the movie in the end. Rather than classify this as science fiction I would classify this film as 'humanities reality', that is, a film that should be considered as one that addresses the most serious human concerns about the slow 'disappearance of the human' (Rick Roderick) in the postmodern world, a world in which 'real' is no longer meaningful and only the commercially manufactured images that sell the most are the only values left.

It is a film that is often called the most inspirational and I hear it changed sci-fi movies for the better. Due to this I thought it was about time to sit down and watch it.Harrison Ford plays Deckard, a cop in Los Angeles in 2019. LA is now entirely futuristic, which back in 1982 you may have presumed it would be but today you will see how away from the mark it is. It is home to giant billboards advertising anything and everything. A dark, gloomy, and wet atmosphere heavily influenced by the Japanese, and above all flying cars. To be fair some of it was right on the money. Deckard is a cop known as a blade runner. A blade runner is a certain unit that hunts down replicants (artificial humans) that were created for off-world work. Every now and again replicants go missing and blade runners must stop them and retire them. Deckard is brought out of his own retirement to hunt down six replicants who have escaped and are on Earth searching for their maker in order to prolong their life. Due to replicants growing emotion over time, each has a life span of four years, however when these replicants realise this they head to meet their creator and keep themselves alive. Deckard must stop them before they get too far, unfortunately for him he meets one of these replicants and falls in love with her. Does he retire her?All of that is generally the back story and what you need to know to understand the basis of the film. Really the film is about Deckard hunting the replicants and falling in love. For those of you that have seen it you will understand what I am about to say, it isn't really about any of that. It is full of philosophical issues that will have you thinking after the film has finished. When this film was first released it wasn't well received and people have taken to it after numerous viewings and discussion. Believe me you must have to watch it more than once because I've seen it once and it is really dull. That may cause unrest with people but I have to say I didn't think much to it. I understand the philosophical views hidden deep but I don't see how that makes it a good movie. There is no real story. The themes could have still been explored with more going on but it was just a lot of sitting around and not doing much. It really wasn't what I was expecting. For starters the villain doesn't really show up till over an hour in, so far into it that I forgot there was even a bad guy. The love scenes didn't work as the characters weren't believable, I understand after reading discussions why that might be, but that isn't good for the average movie goer that wants to leave the cinema happy and finished with it. Not everyone likes to research into the movie. I can really see why it has taken time to be a cult film as it has given people time to put forward their theories which people will then relate to it on another viewing. I'm sorry but I don't get it.I can however understand why it has influenced so much. The visuals alone are stunning, and the fact it was made twenty years ago is not noticeable. If it was released in cinemas tomorrow you would not have known it was made two decades ago. The production design completely outshines any story within this film. I can also see the influence within the philosophical themes and how they have opened up many questions. Are replicants human if they believe they are? In the film they are implanted with memories to make them believe they are real, but are they real if their memories aren't actually theirs? I get that these questions are well explored, and I do like to see this in a film, but I was not hooked on the story. It never really drew me in and I was waiting for the action to kick off and it never did. It was so disappointing. It does have brilliant things about it but the entire outcome of the film is completely dull. Hopefully over time I may come to like it and understand it more. Maybe I don't like it because I don't get it and maybe that is the problem. I'm sure people will completely disagree with this but something more had to grab my attention and it didn't.The look of the film is the top draw of this movie. It looks absolutely fascinating, and I would say to watch it just to see how good it is. The acting is generally OK but nothing great. To be fair the characters were so dull that they had little to work with, although some are replicants so that could make sense. The love story is really forced and I never believed it. However there can be an explanation for all of this..... This could be a spoiler, but then again after watching it you'll realise it is not. Six replicants escape, we only ever meet five!

From the lighting, use of weather, dialogue, casting, visual effects and simply stunning performances from Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer and Sean Young, this film ranks at the top of a rather short list of the most important science fiction films ever made. Gritty and visionary - with the haunting Vangelis soundtrack, and the grim vision of Ridley Scott at the helm, far moreso than Alien, this is his masterpiece.Based on the Philip K. Dick story, \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" this story, and subsequent motion picture paved the way for other noted artificial humans, culminating with Brent Spiner's Lieutenant Commander Data in the 1989 Star Trek: TNG Episode \"The Measure of a Man\", where Data is legally declared a self aware sentient being with the subsequent right to not be a Federation guinea pig.If you haven't yet watched either - watch both. Bladerunner tells a tough story of use, enslavement and ultimately a basic tenet of humanity, that which we cannot control we destroy. In Spiner's Data, we find the android at the cusp of being dismantled for scientific study.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Epitome", "date": "2012-03-25T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2586421"}, {"content": "I have finished this epochal cult film's final cut version (not much as a rematch since it vaguely left me any impression from the very first encounter, which took place more than 10 years ago), the film hasn't dated at all for 30 years, is still sharply crafty with an astonishingly visual impetus, which is pristinely avant-garde as well as its subversive kernel about the clone ethnics.BLADE RUNNER is an atypical Sci-Fi breed (loosely based on science fiction mogul Philip K. Dick's novel \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\"), especially among its time overlapping with STAR WARS trilogy's heyday, it turns a completely opposite aesthetic approach (the nearly all moist and dingy settings, an anti-hero and anti-villain characterization, a foredoomed fatalism spin, the grotesque costume and character moulding, parsimonious fighting sequences), which bears itself out as one of the paramount film in its genre. The film might be trapped in its lengthy narrative tempo, but every single scene is devised with a cataclysmic desperation, resembles Ridley Scott's renowned career-breaking masterpiece ALIEN (1979). While Harrison Ford plays against his comfort zone as a battered \"human\" blade runner, its's Rutger Hauer's replicant Roy Batty overshadows everyone else, buoyed up the somber aura using his near hysterical interpretation of a perplexed highly-intellectual creature whose resentment and despair are so palatable and evocative. The birth of the film was a notorious plight at that time, with an alienated team and financial lapse, even after its theatrical release, its flaccid box office performance sentenced the demise of its outlook, that said, it is a film ahead of its audience by many years, and now its classic rank has been established, how comforting and gratifying.ps. this year Scott's much-hyped prequel of ALIEN sega, PROMETHEUS has unveiled its second trailer, which seems that Scott is back on his virtuoso trajectory, another bona fide classic is forthcoming?

Pure and simple.The visuals of the theme are fantastic, from the godlike Tyrell corporation's temple-designed room to the neon glow of street level and the influences of Chinese culture on the world Scott envisioned. This entire film is nasty and enclosed and dark and horrible. The world Scott created in this film is a retro-fitted slum essentially and a vision of a really quite nasty future. Each house and building has searchlights peering in, giving an impression of an all-knowing police force.Harrison Ford is the Blade Runner of the title, a flawed ex-police given a job. Ford gives the best performance I've ever seen of him, an unsettlingly volatile man. But the real star lies with (one of my favourite actors) Rutger Hauer as replicant Roy Batty, a seething, intelligent, violent creation seeking out his creator to solve one of the most human problems of all. His final soliloquy on a roof top to Harrison Ford's Deckard is one of the MOST beautiful series of words ever uttered on film. You'd have to be a cold hearted person to watch that scene and not feel at least a strong emotional tug.Actually having remarkably little in common with the novel it's based on 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' works in the film's favour as the book is far too complex and confusing to turn into a feature film of any appreciable length. Instead, by taking a simple narrative idea and framing it in the world with some of the characters from the novel, you end up with an incredibly strong story that never seeks to confuse or confound you, with a 'bad guy' so compelling and human it crosses into anti-hero and anti-villain.A fantastic film and one I will willingly watch again, a lot.Read more at: http://thegiff.typepad.com/film_flare/", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 4}, "heading": "A beautiful and haunting film", "date": "2012-03-19T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2583438"}, {"content": "Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Bryon James, Joanna Cassidy, Joe Turkel, William Sanderson, Edward James Olmos and M.

And he used everything he could get his hands on to build an eerie cityscape - Including, ironically, the Millennium Falcon spaceship from Star Wars, which was star Harrison Ford's ride in the SW Original Trilogy.I've heard many Philip K Dick purists pound this film, because it changes some things from the Book \"Do Androids Dream of Dlectric Sheep\" on which this film is based. - But what those people probably don't know, is that Philip K Dick himself approved of the film-Especially the dark look which he claimed was exactly what he was going for. Philip himself understood that written works rarely can be filmed as written, from Gone with the Wind to Lord of the Rings, filmmakers are constrained for time. To tell a 500 page book in 2 hours running time is difficult.So even as Ridley Scott changed some of the science and mechanics regarding \"replicants\" and altered a bit of the character interaction, he did maintain the spirit of the novel - Which is, Do things we create, which appear Human, actually become valid living beings - Do they have souls, and more important, do they have a Spirit? This is explored in this film.\"I Think, therefore I am.\" Eventually, mankind will build a computer capable of passing the Turing Test, and when that happens, will we treat that invention as a slave? Do I treat my Home Computer as a kind of Slave? Actually they way I see it, my home computer always takes on characteristics of myself. So in a way, my home Desktop and my Laptops, are living breathing beings.I loved the Narrated version - Mostly cos thats the way I saw it originally, and the removal of the narration track, kind of ruins it for me, it's not the same without it.Maybe if I had seen it without the narration, but all my information about the movie and what is going on, is IN that deleted narrative.As much as I like the extended cuts and the \"Final Cut\" - I feel sort of betrayed that there was no \"Final Cut\" with the option to have the narration running if I wanted to.There are also several scenes that are different, in the US Theatrical version versus the International version. For instance, when Rutger Hauer kills his \"God\" Dr Tyrell, in the version I originally saw, it's a more gruesome. Later, Hauer shoves a long nail through his hand, thats also missing in the extended/final cut.Other than that, the two versions are pretty close.And I do like both versions, or, all versions. I have seen about 6 different cuts of this, each with slight differences.Mainly, when I first saw this, it was with the Narration, which gives good exposition on what is happening. Without it, there are a number of things left unexplained. The Narration track explains pretty much what is going on, also the nature of Ford's character and the characters of Bryant and Gaff. Also some of the motivations of the Replicants.When Ford is hanging from the top of the Bradbury Building by two broken fingers, in the rain, I was sweating bullets. That scene has the same effect on me in all versions.I'm so glad I was able to find a version with the Narration, it had been 30 years since I had seen that version.

However, this \"restored\" version did and the sound is, at the point, the best I've heard on a Blu-Ray disc....or any DVD, for that matter. The visuals? Well, fans of Blade Runner know all about them. They are fantastic. Scene-after-scene reminded me of a Stanley Kubrick film or another bizarre 1980s movie called \"Jacob's Ladder.\" Because there are so many things to see and hear, and the story is different, one filled with strange characters, I can see where people would watch this film multiple times and enjoy it very much each time. The \"Collector's Edition\" has the best picture ever, according to director Ridley Scott, and \"is the version I'm most pleased with.\" It has added scenes one didn't see in earlier versions. The rest of the DVD has those earlier versions. Apparently, there are several including those with Harrison Ford doing narration, like out of a late '40s film noir.Speaking of the latter, that's what this film looked like: a combination film noir (or neo-noir) and sci-fi movie. It has many dark images, fantastic night-time scenes, wonderful closeups and an always-interesting color palette. Sci-fi films usually get dated in a hurry, thanks to ever-increasing special-effects progress in the movie industry, but this still looks very good.

At first glance, it can be a bit slow. It's told in a classic film noir fashion, so this is to be expected. Director Ridley Scott seems to want to savor every shot, and an astute audience will be able to sense this.Now, I say the film is told in a classic Noir style, but this can be misleading. There is no Humphrey Bogart in Blade Runner, snapping off brilliant one-liners once a second. Only hopeless people, in many ways victims of the merciless world of which they are all a part. Deckard is a typically downbeat protagonist, a hard-boiled cynical leading man with a weakness for heavy drinking. The plot is a mystery in name only, as the audience is allowed to know what Roy Batty, Pris and Leon are all up to before Deckard ever finds out. This only lends to the dread and inevitability of the film, lending further to its pervasive gloom. There is no final scene at the end where the bold detective puts all the pieces together and says \"Ah-Ha!\". Instead, we find Rick Deckard questioning his own existence and drinking away his constant doubts, all the while embroiled in a romantic relationship with someone he's sworn to kill.Blade Runner requires audience participation, particularly in the Director's Cut, which is entirely devoid of some rather necessary exposition provided by the Original Cut's much-maligned voice-over. Certain facts will not be clear even at the end of the film, requiring personal interpretation in order to be appreciated fully.

The year 2007 saw the release of the 'Final Cut' version of the film, and I felt obliged to watch it for that reason. The first time I watched the movie I felt confused and didn't really get the message it contained. Some time later I revisited the movie, and boy was I amazed! I am not only fully convinced that Blade Runner accounts for the best science fiction film ever produced, I also think it's one of the best movies ever made in any genre. I find it very disturbing that the film's intelligence and superiority hasn't been fully recognized here on IMDb, owing mostly to the fact that so many people who have reviewed this film have neither the patience nor the intelligence to understand what the film really is about.The film begins by introducing the viewer to the dark future of Los Angeles with a very powerful and visually sublime opening scene. Technology has advanced to the level where it is possible to manufacture human beings so that they cannot be detected from the real ones without a specific test. This test relies on the fact that although these humanoids, referred to as replicants, are highly intelligent and much more agile than real humans, they lack empathy. Because of their violence replicants have been banned from Earth with special police units, blade runners, hunting down and killing those who can be found. One of these blade runners is Rick Deckard, who gets a task of killing a group of replicants who have escaped to Earth from an off-world colony.The nature of the replicants becomes obvious at the very beginning of the film, when one of them brutally shoots down a blade runner. Throughout the film the replicants show their violent and emotionless behaviour as they advance toward their goal: to meet their maker and gain more life, as they only have a programmed life span of four years. The replicants befriend J. F. Sebastian, a lonely but kind genetic designer who is the one character that gives humanity its true face amid the dark and sinister atmosphere that prevails throughout the film. The brutal murder of Sebastian along with the creator of the replicants truly make the distance between humans and replicants grow tremendously.The film's philosophical question is the meaning of being a human. Despite the compassionlessness of the replicants the gap of them and human beings is questioned throughout the film. Particularly when Deckard cold-bloodily tells Rachael that she is nothing but a manufactured machine with unauthentic memories in a hauntingly sad scene, the treatment of replicants as nothing but engines becomes morally questionable. The true turning point takes place in the end of film, where the replicant saves Deckard's life. In his powerful last words the replicant makes Deckard aware of the fact that even he has feelings. The undertone that human behaviour of disregarding the replicants is unmissable and really sums up the message of the film. For how can human beings judge the replicants when they themselves can show such hate and monstrousity that even surpasses that of the ones they are hunting down? Especially Rachael shows just how humane even a replicant can be. The astonishingly powerful visuals act as a reminder that the humans have indeed left the very world they are living in scarred and dark. This is emphasized even more when the magical score of Vangelis is played in the background. His use of synth-driven melancholic music succeeds so fantastically well in preserving the gloomy atmosphere of the film.I urge anyone who have mixed feelings about the film to watch it again within a few months. No doubt your feelings about the film is changed when you are better prepared for the film which demands that the viewer is patient and analyzing - this is no Adam Sandler comedy where the viewer can just sit back and enjoy the show without any brainwork involved. The film is just like the very theme behind it - the more you comprehend humanity the more complex it turns out to be.

Let's face it, \"Blade Runner\" is a cult film--and those who like it usually don't just like it--they adore it. I've known several people who insist rather rabidly that it's one of the greatest films of all time. And, when I tell them that I don't particularly like the film, they are confused---'how could anyone not love the film?' often say. In one case, the film lover insisted that I borrow his Director's Cut (one of about 17 different Director's Cuts or Special Editions, I think) because I must have been mistaken. Well, after my second viewing, I did enjoy and appreciate the film a bit more. But I still didn't get the devotion to this film it often receives.Here is what I liked and didn't like about the film. It had great sets and was VERY other-worldly. While I think the print was a bit too dark, I understand this was done to fit the very dark mood of the film. However, I just felt the film was too dark--oppressively dark...even sadistically dark (such as the eye gouging scene). It completely depressed me--so much so that I found I just didn't like or care about anyone. And, to top it off, the film ended very badly. The director's original ending (where you learn that Harrison Ford's character is also a replicant) would have been so much better. So, this is one case where the Director's Cut is definitely better, as this original ending has been restored.

Now I know there are those among you, mostly deranged people, who might hold a different view, but I am on the side of those who rate this film. I'll even go so far as to say its right up there with the very best sci-fi films (if you ignore the original theatrical cut, which was truly awful). More of my praise after this brief summary.There is an opening scrolling text on this version of the film that explains the set-up better than I ever could, here it is:\"Early in the 21st Century, THE TYRELL CORPORATION advanced Robot evolution into the NEXUS phase - a being virtually identical to a human - known as a Replicant. The NEXUS 6 Replicants were superior in strength and agility, and at least equal in intelligence, to the genetic engineers who created them. Replicants were used Off-World as slave labour, in the hazardous exploration and colonization of other planets. After a bloody mutiny by a NEXUS 6 combat team in an Off-World colony, Replicants were declared illegal on earth - under penalty of death. Special police squads - BLADE RUNNER UNITS - had orders to shoot to kill, upon detection, any trespassing Replicant. This was not called execution. It was called retirement.\"Now you've read that I shall continue\u0085 Four Replicants have jumped ship, killed the crew and the passengers and made it to Earth. They are; Roy Batty, Pris, Leon Kowalski and Zhora. A retired Blade Runner, Rick Deckard, is brought in to hunt down and 'retire' these Replicants. He is first sent to the Tyrell Corporation where he meets Rachael, a Nexus 6 Replicant. At the time she is unaware of the fact, but Dr. Eldon Tyrell assures Deckard that she's 'special'. Leon had murdered another Blade Runner, Holden, and Deckard goes to Leon's apartment where he finds a clue. Little does he know, the replicants are also trying to find someone\u0085 Someone high up. I'll leave it there or the Spoiler Police will be calling me in for a Voight-Kampff test (again).Visually stunning with a beautiful and atmospheric score by Vangelis, this film has a lot going for it (IMO). Great performances all round; Harrison Ford plays the world-weary Deckard to a tee, Rutger Hauer is excellent as the brutal but fragile Roy Batty and Sean Young plays Rachael with just the right amount of fear. Also worthy of note are; Edward James Olmos as Gaff, M. Emmet Walsh as Bryant, Daryl Hannah as Pris, William Sanderson as J.F. Sebastian, Brion James as Leon, Joe Turkel as Dr. Eldon Tyrell and Joanna Cassidy as Zhora.I have seen this film many times before but this is the first time I realised just how introspective it is. All the action is focused on Deckard and the Replicants without the audience really seeing much outside this group. Yes there are hints; the advertising for the off-world colonies, but apart from that it's very insular. Moving on, I thought the effects were truly stunning, given that there was no CGI back then and the design, the look and the feel of the whole thing is superb. A world is created that the audience could easily imagine Los Angeles 2019 to be like\u0085 OK, maybe not the flying cop cars, but you know what I mean. Yes, it does tend to drag on a bit towards the end, but I can forgive that for a truly excellent film that, for its day, has never been equalled\u0085 VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.My Score: 9.5/10.IMDb Score: 8.3/10 (based on 223,454 votes at the time of going to press).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 92/100 (based on 101 reviews counted at the time of going to press).", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 6}, "heading": "Scotts Finest Hour...

I have a differing opinion on this matter: if we take the movie purely on its visuals, and even on the action, then we loose a large part of what this movie is about. Ebert's comment on the unrealistic nature of Tyrell's death is unimportant for if one is concerned more about how the replicant got into his office then you have missed the entire point of this scene.The original release was not how Ridley Scott wanted the movie. I thought the original was boring but the Director's Cut (1993) has turned the entire style of the movie around. Ford's dubbing has been removed, there is an extended scene with the love affair between Ford and Young, and the ending has been changed completely. The original ending has Ford and Young driving off through a lush green countryside with their eyes on a beautiful future. The other ending is far bleaker with the words \"It's too bad she won't live, but then again who does,\" A very existentialist ending, which really is the whole point of the movie.Blade Runner is about life, death, and the nature of humanity. Six replicants, advanced, genetically engineered robots, have escaped from their offworld colonies and have come to earth to confront their maker, Tyrell. The reason they come to Earth is because they have had a limited life span, four years, built into them, and they are reaching the end of their life. The whole purpose of this reminds us that we are all destined for the same end, and the point of the movie is that there is no way to end it. The close is superb for there is no huge gun battle where Roy (Rutger Hauer) goes out in a blaze of glory, but rather just dies because his time is out. Scott uses a dove in this scene as a possible symbol of the ascension of Roy's doll. In the end we are reminded that we all die. No dream world where the good live forever and punishment for evil is to have this eternal life ended. But then this dream world is not so fantastic after all for we all fall short of the glory of God, and as Romans 3:11 says \"there is no one who is righteous, not even one. There is no one who does good, no one who understands, all have turned away, together we have become worthless.\" We are all evil thus we all die \"the wages of sin is death.\" There is a very interesting idea in this movie though, about the nature of humanity. The ascension of the Roy's soul is a suggestion that there is more to the nature of the replicants than just a simple work tools. The idea is that these replicants are in a way more human than we are. There is a suggestion that Decker (Harrison Ford) is a replicant. We are not told directly but hints are dropped, like one replicant saying to him that he will live longer than him, and also the nature of Rachel. She is a replicant with a full memory implant. As far as she is concerned she is a human, and as far as Decker is concerned he is human. Also notice that there seems to be a glint in the eyes of the replicants. The owl in Tyrell's office always glints.There is a lot to this movie. Not only is it a cinematic masterpiece but it also goes down as a literary masterpiece. The critics, when approaching this movie, obviously want huge action, but Blade Runner does not deliver, rather it reminds us that we will all die.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "A dark vision of the future.", "date": "2011-10-22T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2506931"}, {"content": "So - How do you spell \"Blade Runner\"? Why, it's easy - B-O-R-I-N-G!Yes.

That's the question to definitely ask oneself.And, for me, when it came down to this mighty pertinent question of \"Do Androids (indeed) Dream Of Electric Sheep?\" - Let me tell ya - By the time that I had endured watching this utter disappointment of a movie, from start to finish, I honestly couldn't have given a bloody damn, one way, or the other, what frickin' Androids, or anyone else, for that matter, dreamed of. I really couldn't.Anyways - In conclusion, I would like to say that, yes, I quite readily agree that Blade Runner was, without question, an impressive triumph in production design. There's certainly no doubt about that. And that, yes, this film's \"Vangelis\" soundtrack was equally awesome to the ears. Indeed. - But, with that all set aside, I personally believe that Ridley Scott clearly overstepped his own limited potential as a Director when he made the feeble attempt to fuse the genres of Sci-Fi and Film Noir (in 1982!?) together. Yes. A truly incompatible combo of 2 conflicting genres, in my opinion.I mean, Scott may have understood the genre of Sci-Fi well-enough, as was plainly evident with Alien. But, when it came to Film Noir (in 1982!?), Scott was, quite obviously, an amateur and out of of his realm with this genre, as is plainly evident that he's never tackled Film Noir before, or after, this particular film production.Perhaps, with the production of Blade Runner, Ridley Scott should have taken a few Origami lessons, himself. It may not have improved his direction much. But - Hey! - What the hell?

Let me say this now, symbolism usually creates an exclusionary work. Let me explain.By using symbols you create links between certain objects and other things. Depending on how difficult these links are to understand you create different levels of exclusion to your audience. Some symbols are easy to grasp and exclude almost no one, and it progresses up to symbols that only make sense to a certain group. I would place this movie in that later category. Throughout the movie I found that I recognized the use of symbolism without being able to place what any of it could mean.So to someone who isn't in the group intended to understand the symbolism from this movie, the entire film is a cascade of confusion. Why this, why that, why, why, why! That's the only thing this film left with me.Without understanding the symbols and/or having previous understanding of the plot from reading the book the entire script falls apart. None of the characters actions make much sense and often the motivation for them is non-existent. The effects manage to hold the test of time, but that's about it. No part of this script or plot appreciates like the effects do.SHORT VERSION: If you are familiar with the plot, have read the book, or you think you are in the group that could appreciate the movie's symbolism then watch it.

As of now, it is the only version I myself have seen so I can't say too much about other versions at the moment (although I have seen enough tidbits of the theatrical version to know that the voice-over truly does suck). That being said, I think the Blade Runner version I've seen is one of the best sci-fi movies ever created: alongside others like 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Empire Strikes Back, and Alien. The visuals of this movie are amazing; I could probably watch it just because of the visuals. Even compared with the sci-fi movies being made today (or especially compared with), this movie's dystopian future is highly believable: and all this without any use of computer graphics or animation! The future-streets of Los Angeles are probably the most fully-realized sci-fi set piece ever created and perhaps one of the most influential. The score is also pretty awesome.What I'm curious about though, is what my fellow film-critics think about Harrison Ford's acting. I think his performance comes off a little half-hearted at times and I believe this was one of his least favorite times acting in a film. Also of interest to me, this movie almost seems atypical to Ford's usual characters. Deckard is an anti-hero who's morals are murky, isn't terribly adept at offing replicants, and who doesn't really overcome his enemies through sheer willpower and awesome flip-over-back fight scenes (aka: Indiana Jones, Jack Ryan, or President James Marshall).THE PROFESSIONAL: Before I get into it, let me say first-off that this is the best film that Ridley Scott has ever made. And yes, perhaps it took SEVEN VERSIONS of the movie to actually get to that point. My first exposure to this film was a Director's Cut on VHS. I can't imagine to think what the movie would have been like with Harrison Ford giving voice-over-narration, as in some earlier studio-tampered versions. The Final Cut definitely deserves a spot in the hall of cinematic greatness for all time. Let me say it again with more emphasis, this is the best Ridley Scott film by leaps and bounds \u2013 and it makes me cast suspicious glances at some of his other films. How could the director who made THIS movie (albeit after seven attempts) make THOSE movies? THE FUGITIVE: Come on! Are you telling me that Thelma and Louise is not the best film ever made!?

The replicants are on what turns out to be a deadly mission of their own. Along the way Ford hooks up with Young, together they make the movie.

This highly stylized film sports a pervasively dark and moody atmosphere that's second only to old German Expressionist films and its art direction is absolutely stunning (particularly Tyrell's Egyptian-esque office set above the bleak LA streets). Its influence is plainly evident in nearly any \"Future Noir\" film which followed it.The problem with the film (or, at least, with the original theatrical cut) is the snail-paced editing of any non-action scene. I'm prone to agree with one critic who referred to the film as \"Blade Crawler.\" Despite an admirable cast, gritty, stylized realism and otherwise admirable direction, the pacing stops the movie dead in its tracks. So many dramatic scenes run overly long (most notably the scene of pseudo-rape between Deckard and Rachael). I'm told that this problem is lessened (some say absent entirely) in later cuts of the movie; maybe I'll find one of those cuts more to my liking (I can only hope), as it's the biggest obstacle between itself and a genuine masterpiece.Mr. Ford evidently shares my opinion on the obtrusive voice-over narration of the film. It really adds nothing to the end product aside from a stylistic nod to Film Noir. The actions described or elaborated on are obvious to an attentive viewer. The most glaring example is the climax of the film, when, after a desperate fight between Roy and Deckard in and on top of the skyscrapers of LA, Roy saves Deckard from falling off the roof before he himself dies. Instead of a terse, contemplative silence that could have added to the prevailing mood of the film, we're subjected to a overly-sappy analysis from Deckard about the value of life.Fans of Science-Fiction will enjoy the film for its bleak view of the future. Fans of Film Noir will enjoy it for the stylistic nods to the genre (strong use of lighting, voice-over, hard-nosed protagonist, moody atmosphere, etc...). Fans of both Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford will enjoy it as an early example of both men's careers (it's Scott's third film and one of Ford's first with real dramatic depth).", "rating": 6, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 2}, "heading": "A Flawed Classic", "date": "2011-09-12T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2487656"}, {"content": "As a heads up, this review is based on the Director's cut of this film and will contain spoilers.I just recently re-watched Blade Runner (for the second time only), and found it much better than the first time around. On my first viewing, I did think that it was a good movie, but not great. Years later, I have a much greater appreciation for the film.The story focuses on Deckard, who is a retired Blade Runner asked to \"retire\" a series of humanoids called replicants. Deckard will go through an emotional journey throughout the film, and will question himself at several occasions.The movie opens with flames shooting up in the sky from tall buildings, giving us our first glimpse at this bleak vision of the future. The intro music that accompanies these visuals is very fitting and really sets the tone for a cold, atmospheric experience. I always feel that the first five minutes of every film is extremely important and needs to set the tone for what's to come. A prime example of this is the intro for Vertigo; it is an extremely mesmerising intro, and gives a great taste of what the film has to offer.This great intro is followed by Leon's test. I feel that this scene has great dialog worthy of a Tarantino film (and I'm not implying that Tarantino is a better director; I think they are both amazing). The smoke and the alarm going off, as well as the fan overhead give great imagery and sound to fit the feel of the movie with still a cold atmosphere.Scott creates a highly stylized, convincing world of lies and deceit, and sucks us right in to the story and world which Deckard inhabits. It is dark, bleak and cruel. Most humans are living in the \"colonies,\" and the poor and \"different\" are left in this underworld that is now Earth. In a scene where Deckard chases the replicant Salome, the busy sounds of the city are replaced by soft mood music, gunfire and a beating heart; this works very well in film's context of what is real and what is not. This combination of sounds creates the soundtrack to Salome's death.The movie climaxes with a confrontation scene between Deckard and Roy. Scott plays very well with the lighting during this scene; it adds an eerie feeling to the movie. Every shot is thoughtfully set up with light outside of the building creeping in, removing the need from internal lighting to follow the characters. Roy's insanity is brought to the edge in this scene, and mixes very well with the lighting.All in all, this film is beautifully shot, and brings back, some ways, the film noir genre. It is a very enjoyable sci-fi that goes beyond the spaceship and aliens we normally see. It questions what it means to be human and brings to mind a lot of questions, more than it gives answers.\"It's too bad she won't live, but then again who does?\" This combined with the unicorn, suggesting Deckard is a replicant, gives the argument that we are given a happy ending and that he will lives the rest of his short life with Rachael.10/10", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 4}, "heading": "A Sci-Fi Masterpiece!", "date": "2011-09-09T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2486034"}, {"content": "This is without doubt Ridley Scott's finest hour - not many of his other films come within hailing distance. It is a visual treat of incredible production design, conceptual brilliance of a dystopian future, and a triumph of pre-CGI cinematography! I would score it higher but the story and characters are firmly locked into Marlowesque territory. The scifi element is dealt with merely in the short interview between Roy and Tyrrell, and a few descriptions of off-world activity. It is obvious watching the film now that so many films have lazily copied (but not really equalled) Scott's vision. The Final Cut was better than the original cinema release (middling), but the fuss about the meaning and the ending of the movie is way way overplayed. Let's face it, it is 'Frankenstein' with Roy (The Monster) pursuing the Robot manufacturer Tyrrell (the Baron) while Deckart (Philip Marlowe) tries to track the creature down and kill it. If Deckart is a replicant, as Scott later suggest, then much of the plot, set up, and action becomes flawed and unbelievable, and the film is a ridiculous hoax. They could have left out the Unicorn symbol (rubbish) and I presume it is only in to nod at the original Dick story title. Stick to the visual element and the final redemption of Roy as he rescues Deckart at the end to prove that robots have developed their own sense of humanity. That is the payoff, not naff unicorn origamis! The acting is okay, with Ford not really able to do much (outside of Han Solo and Indiana Jones, he has looked awfully overparted with a range that would not challenge Arnie Schwartzenegger!) but grimace, and everyone else in fairly deliberate robotic mode (so you don't guess the replicants).

Without a doubt, this film deserves mention as a member of an artistic genre, as a science fiction film, and as a great movie altogether. Ridley Scott, who I consider to be an almost stylistic continuation of Kubrick, truly outdoes himself in veering drastically from most of his films' styles. In Blade Runner, you smell the cigarette smoke, feel the humidity of steam in your face, and are both taken aback and also drawn into this gritty world of corruption and backwardness.Harrison Ford makes the cynical detective role look easy, and does what he does best. However, Rutger Hauer shines in this movie, as the victim of society and backwardness, and raises the ultimate truth of the film at its climax.In the end, Blade Runner's only fault is the soundtrack. I will not deny that Vangelis was instrumental in creating the sound of Modern Film score, but in trying to make a totally futuristic, synthetic score, the picture loses the depth that a traditional soundtrack delivers. And, in addition to that, Vangelis tries to incorporate typical instruments, such as the Saxophone, which doesn't quite blend well with his style.Overall, I love the film, and recommend it to most of my sci-fi friends.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "One of Scott's Best", "date": "2011-08-10T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2471650"}, {"content": "\"Blade Runner\" is, together with the original version of \"Planet of the Apes\", my favourite science-fiction film. The two films ask diametrically opposed questions of fundamental philosophical importance. That posed by \"Planet of the Apes\" is \"What distinguishes humans from animals?\"; that posed by \"Blade Runner\" is \"What distinguishes humans from machines?\" The film is set in the year 2019. In 1982 that doubtless seemed a long way away, but in 2011 we can see it as yet another sci-fi film which greatly overestimated the speed of technological progress. Fortunately, the quality of science fiction movies is not always dependent on their ability to foretell the future. The central idea of the film is that science has perfected organic robots called replicants, virtually indistinguishable from adult humans, the one difference being that replicants (supposedly) lack emotions. Replicants may only be used for dangerous or menial work in outer space or on other planets; their use on Earth is forbidden. Nevertheless, replicants have been known to defy the ban and return to Earth, where they are hunted down and killed (or \"retired\" to use the official euphemism) by a special police squad known as \"Blade Runners\". The main character is Rick Deckard, a Blade Runner assigned the task of \"retiring\" four returned replicants hiding in Los Angeles. In order to prevent them from developing human emotions, the life-span of replicants is limited to four years, and it is believed that these four have come to earth to force the Tyrell Corporation, which manufactured them, to extend their lives. Another important element in the plot is a romance between Deckard and Rachael, a beautiful young woman whom he later discovers to be a secret replicant. Unlike the other replicants we see in the film, Rachael is a more advanced model who believes herself to be human, having had artificial memories implanted into her mind. Despite its science-fiction theme, \"Blade Runner\" can also be regarded as belonging to the neo-noir genre. Like other neo-noirs from this period, such as \"Chinatown\", \"Body Heat\" and \"Gorky Park\", it has a very distinctive visual style. The city we see is very futuristic, complete with towering buildings and flying cars, and yet for all its high-tech buildings, the Los Angeles of 2019 is a gloomy, rainswept city disfigured by litter, graffiti and poverty, a literal and metaphorical City of Dreadful Night. The atmosphere is reminiscent of 1940s noirs such as \"The Big Sleep\", also set in a dark, rainy Los Angeles, although it is said that director Ridley Scott also drew on his roots in the industrial North-East of England. Since 1982 this dark, moody look has become something of a clich\u00e9 in science-fiction, horror and superhero movies, but in its day it marked a radical alternative to the bright, gleaming \"Star Wars\" vision of the future. Another typically noir element in the film is the character of Deckard, a disillusioned, world-weary detective of the type who, had the film been made thirty or forty years earlier, would undoubtedly have been played by Humphrey Bogart. Harrison Ford was already known to the public as Han Solo in \"Star Wars\" and Indiana Jones; \"Blade Runner\" was perhaps the film that first revealed him as an intelligent, thoughtful actor as well as an action hero. This, together with \"Witness\" and \"The Fugitive\", is probably his best performance. Sean Young is an actress who has largely disappeared from view in recent years, but in the eighties she was a rising star, and here she gives her one really memorable performance as Rachael, the woman who has to cope with the knowledge that everything she has hitherto believed about herself is a lie. Rachael's hairstyle is a deliberately old-fashioned one, possibly in order to suggest another link with forties film noir. (Sean is one of several female actors of her generation to be known by a male forename; another, Daryl Hannah, appears as one of the four escaped replicants). The third great performance comes from Rutger Hauer as the replicant Roy. Hauer, who is Dutch, speaks English fluently, but with a slight foreign accent, and this is put to good use in the film to suggest a being almost identical to, and yet subtly different from, the human characters. (Rachael's rather formal speech has a similar effect). Roy is believed to be a dangerous, alien being, yet as the film progresses it becomes clear that he and his fellow replicants are fully human souls with their own personalities who have developed in full the emotions they were not supposed to share. A key scene comes near the end, where Roy stretches out his hand to prevent Deckard from falling to his death. This scene called to mind Michelangelo's famous painting of God creating Adam, but reverses its meaning. Deckard is a member of the race which created Roy, and therefore a metaphorical \"god\", but here it is the created being who stretches out his hand to his creator and thereby confers the gift of life on him. In this moving scene we see that the replicants are every bit as capable as humans- if not more so- of experiencing the emotions of pity and compassion. The film initially performed poorly at the box office, but later became recognised as a classic, especially after a \"director's cut\" was released in 1992. (I must admit that I never saw the original version that was released in cinemas; my comments are based upon the director's cut and the more recent \"final cut\"). Scott is said to regard \"Blade Runner\" as his most complete and personal film; I would regard it as his finest. There is not enough space here to do justice to all its complexities and shades of meaning, but it must count as one of the best films of the eighties and one of the most intelligent and profound science-fiction films of all time. 10/10", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 11, "votes": 20}, "heading": "One of the most intelligent and profound science-fiction films of all time", "date": "2011-08-04T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2468980"}, {"content": "I'm a huge fan of Ridley Scott, many of whose titles reside in my top 50 all-time greats, but this film is a mess.

Harrison Ford is a semi-retired blade runner called back into action to hunt down four renegade replicants that have mutinied and returned to earth in search of their creator, who they hope will extend their lives.Ridley Scott's science-fiction/film noir epic based on Philip K. Dick's novel may not quite live up to its legendary cult status, but it certainly comes close enough to warrant a success. I saw the film on its original release in 1982 when it received mixed critical reviews and tepid box office, but its reputation has steadfastly and deservedly grown over the years. It is that rare film that actually improves on subsequent viewings as it reveals hidden depths on further introspection and facets which were dismissed as misfires the first time around have been re-evaluated.One thing that was never disputed was the visual impact of the film. Not since Fritz Lang's legendary silent film masterpiece Metropolis has a futuristic world been depicted with such convincing and compelling realism. The Earth of Blade Runner is a grungy, polluted, rain-soaked hell-scape of seemingly endless night drenched in neon, gigantic skyscrapers and nightmarishly crowded streets. This is a rare film in that even if the story failed to work at all, one could sit in wonder for the running time just admiring the elaborate denseness of the background and the limitless imagination of the director and the set designers, costume designers, visual effects artists, and various technicians that brought it all to breathtaking life. We see flourishes of both the future and the past in everything, including wardrobes and hairstyles that remind one of the 1940s. That alone is a simply amazing achievement. Truly, the sheer verisimilitude of the environment is nothing less than stunning.The \"villains\" of the piece \u2013 the replicants \u2013 are undeniably deadly, but their hopes for a better and longer life make them oddly sympathetic. These synthetic humans ironically seem more emotionally accessible than a number of the humans populating this future, which is unquestionably the point the film makes. The question of what exactly constitutes \"being human\". The lines are further blurred with the introduction of the assistant to the head of the company that manufactures replicants, a stunning beauty named Rachel (played by Sean Young), who unbeknownst to herself is a replicant with the memories of another programmed into her. Ford becomes entranced by her and feels oddly sympathetic to her plight when she begins to realize the truth.One of the things that drew many complaints initially was the low-key performance of Ford in the central role coupled with his world-weary voice-over narration. However, I have grown to believe that both elements work surprisingly well. The narration and the restraint of Ford's performance are both ingredients very popular and often important to the noir genre that Scott is partially paying homage to. Vangelis' soulful jazz-inspired score also adds to the atmosphere of the piece.Rutger Hauer is first-rate as the charismatic and threatening leader of the replicants. If his final confrontation with Ford is anti-climactic, Hauer nicely pulls off the undertones of the character's final moments on screen. Young has become a huge Hollywood joke after her career derailed a number of years ago, but her work here is quite moving and displays some of the promise that she demonstrated early in her career. Neither Edward James Olmos or M. Emmet Walsh have much to do as Ford's colleague and supervisor. Joe Turkel provides a subtle turn as the creator of the replicants. William Sanderson is also memorable as a lonely company employee whom the replicants befriend for their own reasons. And who can forget the lithe and beautiful Daryl Hannah, who makes a terrific impression as the deadly acrobatic replicant Pris. Her showdown with Ford is one of the film's highlights, even if it could have lasted longer.A truly marvelous achievement that should be watched more than once to fully appreciate what Scott and company have accomplished.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "A visually stunning film that actually improves on subsequent viewings", "date": "2011-06-22T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2447550"}, {"content": "I recently watched this for the first time, and I'm quite pleased with this film overall.

I watched this masterpiece of a film first time out and loved it from the start - in fact, it's not only my favourite sci-fi film but one of my favourites of all time. Whilst everyone is entitled to an opinion, I do find it laughable that some members of the IMDb community can give this classic a 1 star rating. Many conclude that the film does not live up to the expectations of the book. This of course is a nonsensical argument \u2013 the mental images derived from a book cannot be realistically compared to the reality of pictures on the silver screen. Everybody's interpretation is different. In other cases, the deep meaning and natural intelligence of Bladerunner appear to be too much for some. May I suggest these people look under the sections for Steve Seagal and Chuck Norris!These inane comments cannot detract from what is a groundbreaking piece of cinema. In a post apocalyptic Los Angeles where acid rain drenches the city from the gloomy sky above and people who can afford it search for the salvation of off world colonies, we enter the world of the Bladerunner \u2013 a specialist law enforcer tasked with the termination of human replicants who have turned 'rogue'.Not an easy task when considering that the human clones in question are difficult to distinguish from the real article. And in Rick Deckard's case (Harrison Ford), the task is to prove all the more difficult as the 'skinjobs' in question start to develop their own feelings and emotions for the first time.Bladerunner is a landmark film because unlike many sci-fi epics, it has stood the test of time. Made only 5 years after the original Star Wars film, the movie has aged incredibly well and looks as fresh and modern now as it did in 1982. More remarkably the film was made before the onset of computer aided graphics, which provides a fitting testament to how well this film is made. Star Wars: A New Hope looks dated \u2013 Bladerunner does not.The bleakness of the sets, the quirky dialogue and even quirkier film score by Vangellis, all add together to make a first rate sci-fi thriller which gets better the more times you watch it. Rutger Hauer provides the stand out performance as Roy Batty, the leader of the malfunctioning group, who is a ruthless killer by trade but famously shows compassion for the first time just before he dies as his emotions evolve.The film delves into a number of thought provoking topics including one which has troubled humanity since the beginning of time \u2013 how long have we got? Do you want to know or would you rather not? And in our world where genetic modification is raising questions in the medical sector, Bladerunner also poses this same question but some 20 years earlier. Regardless of whether you watch the original or Directors Cut version, this movie stands out as filmmaking of the highest calibre with a realism that everyone can identify with.

The direction is superb, the lighting atmospheric, many performances sublime. Rutger Hauer as lethal replicant Roy, and delicious Sean Young, as the vulnerable Rachael are particularly memorable. Neither should we overlook a highly original score, delivered by musical genius Vangelis. His association with Jon Anderson, on the album \"Short Stories\", took synthesized orchestration in new directions during the 1980s. As for Bladerunner, we receive a unique soundtrack few other sci-fi films can equal. For those with a taste for science fiction, Blade Runner is a nod to those richly drawn, intellectual films that audiences were lucky enough to experience in the late 60s and 70s. (I'm thinking of such incredible cinema as Silent Running, 2001 A Space Odyssey and Barbarella). Alas, Hollywood has opted for more predictable and violent fodder in recent years, leading me to suspect films of Blade Runner's quality will remain rare.Blade Runner's beauty lies in a commitment to present the audience with a panoramic future, yet still rooted in a world dominated by the fragility of human experience. The characters that inhabit this world are flawed, tragic and meaningful. There's no two-dimensional superheroes here. We're presented with the realities of cruel commerce and technocratic supremacy. However, the technocrats receive their comeuppance. In this way, Blade Runner is also a moral parable, though never preaches.The replicants seek \"more life\", although it's Rachael and Deckard that illicit our sympathy. Rachael is deceived by the Corporation, while Deckard is a reluctant \"fixer\", charged with \"retiring\" that same organization's mistakes. This is very clever writing. Hampton Fancher's screenplay interweaves plotting and sub-plot with ingenious skill. Such literary craftsmanship is rarely translated so successfully to film. The script itself is one of the best I can remember in a sci-fi film, including wonderful quotes from such luminaries as William Blake. (I can't remember the last occasion an English Poet was quoted in a Hollywood Movie, though such references add unforgettable texture to an already deeply symbolic piece).With this in mind, I'll leave you with Roy's moving epilogue: \"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.

I am 17 and the only reason I watched this was for school. This movie was made 30 years ago and somehow I don't think teenage males were the target audience, so if I actually enjoyed this movie it would be a miracle.That being said there are a few factors you can simply judge a movie on to determine whether or not it's good. One of them would probably be character development. Another would probably how well the story is told. Well the main character is given no back story whatsoever and spends the all but the last 10 minutes either apathetic, bored or startled (sidenote: the best bladerunner ever was nearly killed easily twice?). The antagonists are portrayed as evil right up until the last 10 minutes. Not misunderstood or desperate, just evil. The only time they are portrayed as desperate it comes off more as dire manipulation; oh and the desperation is portrayed by the actors saying \"we're desperate\" with sad looks. THIS IS NOT GOOD CHARACTERISATION. Antagonists can be evil...in comic books and Michael Bay movies. There is literally a scene where they find a genetic engineer working in a freezing environment and they strip him of his coat and then interrogate him while he freezes to death...for no conceivable reason (especially seeing as it took the guy twice as long to tell them the important information as he shivered)I have not yet spoken to one person who could understand what was going on until they watched it twice.

A magnificent meditation on the reality of death, and life's ultimate lack of meaning. One or two mentally challenged reviewers have complained that \"replicants\" could easily have been created a different colour, say, green; or been given six arms. Why were they made exactly the same as human beings? Answer: because they are exactly the same as human beings. In fact, all human beings are replicants of oneself. They are what one sees with one's own eyes, in the mirror, and all around one. If you follow the film closely. I think it was Ogden Nash who wrote: \"My fellow man I do not care for/ I often ask me what he's there for/ The only answer I can find/ Is reproduction of his kind.\" Had he lived a little later, he might have written \"replication of his kind\".One of the brighter dumb-dumbs points out, in a puzzled way, that there are no children in this vale of tears.

Are unicorns part of everyone's folk-memory? Everything about Blade Runner is fabulous. It soars where the clunky and only semi-literate Kubrick stumbles and fumbles.

As such, this review will attempt to keep such terms to a minimum.In 1979 Ridley Scotts second film that he ever made, \"Alien\", was a smash hit. (His first film ever was \"The Duelist\" in 1977, in case you were wondering). The movie \"Alien\" was hailed as a masterpiece in which he mixed visceral horror with science fiction. Its no surprise then, that Scott's third movie, he mixed film noir and science fiction in much the same way to make the technically astonishing movie \"Blade Runner\" based on the 1968 classic by Phillip Dick called \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\". Although it did not do well at the box office, is another stroke of genius. As the movie starts off, there is a virtual tour of futuristic Los Angeles. The movie watcher is made to feel as if they have awoken from a cryogenic chamber and are observing the changes that have taken place.: The weather and environmental color is drab, there are gigantic animated billboards offering goods and services(something that didn't exist in 1982 but already exists now), and that Coke is still around. Even though the scenes were constructed using 1982 technology, they are still breathless and when viewed on a flat screen TV are close to three dimensional. Next is the introduction to the melancholic Deckard (played by Harrison Ford) who in contrast of the Replicants that he chases, appears to take life for granted. The philosophical themes in this picture are endless. One popular philosophy is that Deckard himself is a Replicant this theory is doubtful as Replicants appear to be superior in strength and maybe even intelligence to humans. Deckard is only able to bring Replicants down to retirement by relying on the one edge that humans have over Replicants: experience. Since Replicants can only live for four years, they do not have as much experience at anything as their human counterparts. In addition to the movies in depth philosophy, Blade Runner makes several realistic predictions: (1) Los Angeles/California is predicted as being culturally isolated and diverse to the point of mayhem. This forecast is even more probable today, than it was in 1982. California and especially Los Angeles has already become extremely diverse culturally. Caucasians no longer represent the majority of the population. Additionally, each ethnic group tends to isolate from the other ethnic groups. There is Chinatown, Korea Town, Olvera Street, and Watts. Each neighborhood has its own cultures and languages that are not only spoken, but seen on Billboards and even street signs. Select cultures are even pandered to by the government. Even though it is currently the law to be a US Citizen to vote and to have a driver's license, and even though it is a requirement to read English to become a US citizen, Drivers License exams and ballots are written in Spanish and many of the Asian languages. There is no need or incentive for an immigrant to assimilate into one uniform society. (2) Technology continues to advance at a prolific rate. From 1982 to 2010, technology has grown tremendously. No one in 1982 would have dreamed of DVDs, flat screen TVs, GPS systems, iPods, or cell phones that do just about everything would be in wide use in 2010. Flying cars may not be far off. It would appear that the only thing that might prevent Replicants from ever being built would be a possible ethical/political dilemma much like the one that surrounds cloning. (3) The weather and environment appears to be drearier. As global warming theories and oil and other toxic spills become more prevalent, this event is quite possible. (4) Big Corporations still exist and exert their influence. From the Coke billboards to the billboards offering a better life on a space colony, consumers are still being told that their life is inadequate but could be made better if they purchased certain products or moved to a \"better\" location. Watching the movie leaves one with the feeling of awe. The realism of situations and special effects only serve to enhance this effect.

It came in 1982, long before I was born, a whole decade in fact. And so, I had the pleasure of viewing the \"Final Cut\" of the film. Ridley Scott's greatest achievement I'll admit. A beautifully dark sci-fi spectacle that works on many levels and provokes so many thoughts you'll find several reasons to love it.I'll start with the cast, who is incredible. Now that it's been out for a while, many of the actors are now quite well known. Harrison Ford surprised me honestly, being so different from the type of character he usually lays. My favorite role he's ever done. I love Sean Young in the movie, as well as Daryl Hannah. These actors portrayed their characters so excellently I could quite possibly never get tired of it. The list is nearly endless; Edward James Olmos, James Hong, and Rutager Hayer as Roy, my favorite character in it all. The way the story flows, it starts us off believing the Replicants are devious and cold hearted machines, as you might discern in that opening murder scene. But as the story continues you will realize that is far from the actual plot at all. By the time it's over; don't be surprised if you feel Deckard is the actual antagonist instead of the initial speculation. This is not the lone-cop, gun-slinger, film, by far.And the look of the film, it's just remarkable. The lighting creates a very dark and gloomy atmosphere. That's one aspect in itself for which many like myself can love it. The cinematography is just exhilarating, a dirty world populated with silhouettes and a rather dystopia-like vision of our future. And the very stirring part of it all that is wasn't all that fictional of a world to envision. That story took place in 2019, and it's now in 2010, and yet watching it I felt like it was a future Earth might is still very susceptible too. Themes of pollution, over-population, among so many other things within these magnificent shots, it probably prompts most the loss of humanity that the advent of technology brings. There's just no way to watch \"Blade Runner\" and receive no feeling from it. My first viewing of it lead me to believe it was simply a well told story.

At this time, for colonization and exploration of other planets were developed Replicants, genetically engineered humanoids, stronger and faster than a human being and with comparable intelligence. But they were emotionally unstable, had little empathy,aggressive behavior and their life was limited to four years.

I don't really know how to explain what that means, so I'll just say some stuff.You all know the story: Harrison Ford is a bladerunner, a detective who specializes in the \"retirement\" of rogue androids that are exact duplicates of humans, called replicants. It's an interesting concept that is actually very flawed.First of all, if replicants have a tendency to go rogue and become murdering lunatics that also blend into human society because they are exact duplicates of humans, why not rectify this situation by not making replicants what amounts to clones of humans. I mean, you've got the whole android part down pretty well, so why not just remove the human features, or give them a giant tattoo on their face at the very least.Second, that test thing is really impractical. If the only way of finding if someone is a replicant or not is to sit them down and examine their emotional reactions with ridiculous specificiy, then you need to find a better test.

Wow, doesn't it look great, even 'just' on DVD! Blade Runner I have seen many, many times. I consider it a great scifi classic, but I know that some of the criticism I had when I first saw it in the cinema back in 1983 still exists. For instance, no replicant on the move will agree to participate in the Voight-Kampff-test that the Blade Runners perform. They know that when their true nature is revealed, the Blade Runner will kill them. So why cooperate? And why does it take so long for the Voight-Kampff machine to get results? Wouldn't it be more logical if Blade Runners got a gadget that can recognize a replicant in 5 seconds? For instance by body temperature? Isn't it a little bit silly when you say: \"Okay, I suspect that you're not human but a renegade replicant. Would you mind sitting down with me for 15 minutes so I can investigate whether my suspicions are false or indeed correct?\"Another thing that's still hard to swallow: Deckard maybe being a replicant himself. Before the Directors Cut there was no Unicorn dream sequence. Therefor there weren't any indications that Deckard might be a machine. So why think of the idea? If Ridley Scott truly wanted to tell a tale of replicant chasing replicant he should have been more clear on that subject. Last but not least. If you think of Deckard being fully human (instead of being a replicant) I think the love story between him and Rachel is also difficult to believe. Why should a human fall in love with an android, even if she's so beautiful as Rachel? Isn't that... immoral? Wrong? Sick?Okay, it's not my goal to burn down Blade Runner, because I still think it's one of the 30 best films ever made.

There is no doubt that the film was an extra-ordinary masterpiece of special effects and philosophical predictions and messages. The aspect of the film im having trouble comprehending is the entertainment value. The slow moving scenes seemed to drag on and on with very little happening. The dialogue was stagnant while the acting wasn't anything extra-ordinary. There were points in the film where i felt bored. Maybe it was because you cannot appreciate fine art by looking at it from a distance. The confusion of the symbolic references and subliminal messages left the viewer trying to comprehend every little detail in the film. Apart from the slow dialogue there was not much else negative about the film. The occasional pointless scene popped up every now and then and the hidden clues left me feeling frustrated at times but the story line and messages the film portrays more than makes up for this. The attention to detail in the film is amazing. The lack of CGI during that time means this film was made by models. This to me is incredible. The graphic quality on the DVD means this film looks by no means outdated. The costumes were excellent. The prediction of the changes in fashion is almost spot on. The language that is spoken is also unique as it is a combination of many different dialects spoken today. Steering away from the graphic and entertainment side of the movie leaves us with meaning of the film. What is the meaning of the film you ask? What is the meaning of existence... So what is the meaning of existence? It is a question that can never be truly answered but this film is a sort of gateway into which the viewer can be taken into and given a reason to think about this question. The film gives very little assistance in this great dilemma but it gives plenty of opportunity to explore this concept through its many sub themes. The creation's triumph over its creator- This was very graphically depicted in the film. As Roy Batty's thumbs penetrated the brain of his creator he effectively eliminated the only thing that had control over him. The reason he killed JS Sebastian in such a brutal way leaves one to question Roy's morals and ethics. If he was truly human, would he have done such a violent act? Maybe thats not such an important fact but it leads to the freedom that Roy had been searching for. Personal Identity- The reason the replicants kill ruthlessly is to find out more about their own identity. The memories they have been given do not adequately fufilll their emotional needs. They have a burning desire to survive and the security of knowing where they come from will aid their mission. So what is life? Blade Runner makes you think about what is the true definition of life. Without a greater being determining what your meaning is, are you not pointless? There is no right or wrong answer but the important thing is that this films saves us from our ignorance and makes our grey matter work. My verdict of the film is... It is a masterpiece.

After a bloody mutiny in a colony, the Replicants are declared illegal on Earth and hunted down by the Blade Runner units, special police squads that shoot them to kill. The execution of a Replicant is called retirement.In November 2019, in Los Angeles, the retired Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is summoned by his former chief Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh) that assigns him to hunt down four Replicants that are hidden in Los Angeles. Deckard studies the profiles of Roy (Rutger Hauer), Pris (Daryl Hannah), Leon Kowalski (Brion James) and Zhora (Joanna Cassidy) and finds that they had been designed with four years lifespan maximum and they tried to infiltrate themselves in the Tyrell Corporation. Deckard visits their creator, Dr. Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel), in his corporation. Sr. Tyrell asks Deckard to demonstrate his Voigt Kampff method to discover the Replicants in his assistant Rachael (Sean Young) and Deckard concludes that she is a sophisticated Replicant but she does not know. When Deckard \"retires\" Zhora and Leon, he feels affected by their deaths and by the question of Rachel whether he has tested himself to know whether he is a Replicant. But he needs to end his mission and find Roy and Pris. \"Blade Runner\" is a melancholic work of art that raises existential questions about fear, life, death, emotions, mortality, humanity, dehumanization and love among other philosophical questions in an environment totally destroyed by excessive pollution, technology, marketing and consumption. The wrecked Earth is left to police and little people only, the others inhabitants have moved to the colonies in the off-world. The conflict appears when the retired Blade Runner Deckard is forced to hunt down Replicants again but now with different feelings, after falling in love for the Replicant Rachel and in doubt whether he is also a Replicant.

In broad terms, it's about an ex-police officer who specializes in eliminating artificial humans (replicants), and his efforts to track down four who have illegally come to earth. There's more to it than that, of course, but watching the story unfold and letting it draw you into this alternate future is a pleasure that I wouldn't want to rob from anyone reading this. Just trust me, there are deep themes that are explored here, but the movie is thoroughly entertaining even if you aim to enjoy it on only its most superficial levels.\u00a0As you may have guessed, this is my favorite Scott film, as well as my favorite Harrison Ford role. It stands out for its memorable and three dimensional characters like the elegant and haunting replicant Rachael and the kind (but creepy) Sebastian.

And I will even admit, I was among them at the time. I didn't understand the depth of \"Blade Runner\" until I had had subsequent multiple experiences of it. I don't know if you really see Blade Runner as much as become absorbed into it. Although Blade Runner was a box office disappointment upon its release, it had stiff competition in 1982. Spielberg's \"ET\", the sentimental science fiction film, had broken all box office records; Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, was the favorite for pure good guy versus bad guy SF; and other films outside the genre were much more uplifting and linear, such as \"Tootsie\" and \"An Officer and a Gentleman\". (The other under-appreciated masterpiece of that year was \"Sophie's Choice\", although Meryl Streep did deservedly win for Best Actress.) Despite its mixed critical reception, including a very ambivalent review by Roger Ebert who called it a \"failure as a story\", \"Blade Runner\" has emerged as one the three best films of 1982, the other two being \"Ghandhi\" and \"Sophie's Choice\". My revised list of Best Picture nominees in alphabetical order for 1982: \"Blade Runner\", \"E.T.\" \"Ghandhi\", \"Missing\", \"Sophie's Choice\". I would still give top award nods to Ghandhi but only by the slimmest of margins. Blade Runner would be my very close second choice. (\"The Verdict\" and \"Tootsie\" are good films but not exactly masterpieces.)The story concerns relatively new technology: the producing of humanoid cyborgs which have become dangerously close to human life. They are called \"Replicants\". The latest models appear to have feelings and emotions like humans. Now, some renegade Replicants who feel they were treated as slaves on a labor planet have sprung from their \"slavery\" and returned to earth. They wish to confront their creators. Richard \"Rick\" Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a \"blade runner\", a kind of detective/police officer who finds and exterminates renegade Replicants. One of his tools is a series of questions offered a suspected Replicant designed to create responses which tip-off the questioner as to whether or not the participant is human. But then Decker falls for a female Replicant, Rachel (Sean Young) who seems all too human.In the 1950's and 1960's, a very select group of eclectic readers absorbed and appreciated the work of a somewhat lesser-known science fiction writer, Philip K. Dick. Dick was a maverick of the SF genre, essentially immersing readers into a world much more reminiscent of the works of Raymond Chandler and Dashiel Hammett than Gene Roddenbery or George Lucas. Philip Marlowe and Sam Spade could navigate Blade Runner's darkened and misty streets much more effectively than either James T. Kirk or Luke Skywalker. While the most popular writers of the SF genre were still getting into rocket ships and flying to planets for high adventure, Dick was painting on an entirely new canvas, where urban noir meets future technology. Flying taxis and large plasma screens reside along with overpopulation and dirty streets. And he was writing in the 1950's and 1960's! However, even by 1982, audiences were still craving the likes of heroic science fiction such as Star Trek and Star Wars. Typical audience sensibility was still far behind \"Blade Runner\". What made \"Blade Runner\" tough on audiences at the time of its release and so appreciated today is that it challenges viewers' perceptions of not only the future but the nature of modern reality itself. Unlike Star Wars and Star Trek, \"Blade Runner\" is a cautionary tale, an updated version of \"Frankenstein: The Modern Prometheus\" and therefore, everything presented in its world is at the very least disconcerting and at the worst quite horrifying. SF has been predominantly about Utopias. \"Blade Runner\" is a story set in a \"Dystopia\". SF most often distinguishes between right and wrong, good and bad. \"Blade Runner\" is about the blurry shades between ethics and justice, where the ones with which we most empathize are outlaws. SF endings are often neat and tidy. \"Blade Runner\" offers a very ambiguous and contemplative ending (and I am not referring to the final coda of the original theatrical release). \"Blade Runner\" deals with themes concerning the larger questions of life and meaning, very uncommon in SF cinema as a whole. And that's why \"Blade Runner\" has become not only an iconic classic of the SF genre, it is one of the reasons that cinema has continued to be a captivating medium. \"Blade Runner\" is in the same company as \"Ghandhi\", \"Citizen Kane\", and \"Casablanca\". Know that SF can sometimes transcend its own genre, and BR inspired a new wave of films, such as \"The Matrix\" and \"Dark City\". \"Blade Runner\" was and is one of the finest examples of watershed ground-breaking cinema.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 6}, "heading": "The \"Casablanca\" of Science Fiction Films: Maybe the Deepest of SF Cinema that Birthed the Cyber SF Era", "date": "2010-06-01T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2258040"}, {"content": "We waited eagerly for this movies release in 1982.

After all of what's gone on and after all the venturing and the talking and the process of investigation, it boils down to one 'evil' character, who's a machine, and one 'just' character, a human-being, interacting; at which point we realise the human-being was a genre archetype and a plain old character following orders given to him by a larger force whereas the robot was a wandering, free spirit whom dared to dream and craved more out of life. The human comes across as more machine-like than the machine, with the machine coming across as more emotional and feeling-filled than the member of the human species. Such is the richness of Blade Runner that tn a lesser film, this exchange wouldn't have taken place and the character of Roy might've been a homicidal robot with a mindless agenda.Born into a slavery; used and then put through a grinder of negative emotions, Roy revolts and breaks out, consequently freeing himself and allowing himself the ability to explore things at his own pace, opening up his mind and allowing him to explore; learn; love and want to harm those that destroyed what he loved after being an assistant to the system. Blade Runner is like that, an eye on spectacle and scope for its location just as much as it has a spot of affection for its characters in what they think, feel and desire; if indeed they're even interested in anything more than grey trench-coats; glum expressions and order following .The lead is a certain ex-police officer named Rick Deckard (Ford), a man occupying a glum and gloomy, rain-sodden Los Angeles in 2019; a man of whom trudges through damp, wet streets with many others in a doomy looking; steamy and enclosed Chinatown area as large blimps hover above the mere mortals scrambling around in their squaller advertising breaks away to more tropical, more Utopian places. Director Ridley Scott opens his film with an establishing shot of the entire city, flying cars and the impressive canopy layer of some skyscrapers capturing the beauty and sheer awe within as an accompanying instrumental musical track emphasises both these traits. This is interestingly interjecting with random bursts of flames from vents of some kind, the likes that instill sudden senses of danger and risk of harm; perfectly capturing the world he's about to take us into as the camera very slowly creeps towards the city.The film gives its lead, Deckard, a mission in the grand tradition of noir in the sense it is his job to find something for someone. In days of old; be it The Maltese Falcon or Murder, My Sweet; noir leads have usually looked for an item or a person. Blade Runner, in all its hybridising glory, has fun with this particular premise in having its lead look for a sort of combination of both: a man/machine hybrid named a Replicant. The chief Replicants in the story, who've gone rouge and are seeking an extension of life, are Pris (Hannah), the film's femme fatale archetype whose birthday the film teasingly places on Valentine's Day; Zhora (Cassidy); Leon Kowalski (James) and the somewhat deranged and equally disturbing in his persistent state of calmness, Roy Batty (Hauer).Scott gets across a sense of futuristic scope in the film by setting a sequence at the slimiest, seediest and nastiest of run down night spots than you can, but a place that actually comes with advanced video phone technology in the back, suggesting that a sense of technological advancement has reached even these sorts of God-forsaken places. The film's meshing of classical noir with more contemporary science fiction is a given; but the film's hybridising of genres is perhaps best highlighted in a scene involving two characters, a toy manufacturer named Seb (Sanderson) and the aforementioned Pris, whom walk down a hallway of an apartment block towards Seb's home. Lights from outside systematically light up and make dimmer again the hallway, in doing so, casting expressionistic shadows across the walls and floors rendering the location one of both horror and noir as this strange looking woman with an agenda attempts to infiltrate her way in. The sequence is given an added sense of horror when we enter the man's apartment and observe the uncanny array of odd looking moving toys he has made over the years. This strange imagery combines with Pris' overall look in creating something quite terrifying, something the film acknowledges when it has Pris disguise herself as one of these toys later on in another sequence, suggesting a certain 'at one-ness' she shares with the items. The lighting lights the location the whole time with sudden glares and then total darkness, suggesting a sense of light or life that'll shortly come to an end, like an average house light strobing before it dies out.The film places Deckard on a strand of the detective ilk, he visits places and garners clues to everything which along the way leads him to the character of Rachel (Young), but the film is not an exercise in narrative as much as it is an exercise in technicality and mise-en-scene. Its grim view on man and machine being unable to co-exist in a world full of modernity and technological advancements is highlighted in an early scene involving Leon and a test of some description, as well as later on when Roy essentially kills off his creator, is counter-balanced with Deckard's ability to connect with Replicant Rachel.

It is almost a live action anime when one looks at other films such as \"Akira\". Is it the acting you ask? No, the acting could not be better, Harrison Ford playing the lead, a man who hunts down rouge androids and Rutger Hauer is always excellent if you ask me. No one does a better job if he had a more typical Hollywood look he would have been the lead in a lot more mainstream fare. And Sean Young and Daryl Hannah look absolutely great, with Daryl looking rather hot. So is it the story? Not entirely. The story has very good elements in it and there is something there. So what is it you ask? Well I know I am going to get hammered for voicing this opinion, but keep in mind it is an opinion...the main thing I had a problem with is the lack of action. I know story and such are important and yes there are lots of movies with no action I like, but this movie was about a man hunting down dangerous androids. This alone should entail that there is going to be a lot more action in the movie than there ended up being. Though the ending was excellent and everything else in this movie was superbly done, I needed some more shoot outs, more blood, and more death. At times the pacing in the movie had me a tad bored, and while it was still nice to look at and it was nice to see the actors have some good dialog, I always kept wanting more adrenaline type action. So there I said it, and I sort of regret it as this is probably one of those movies that people will not take to kindly anything negative said about it. Overall though it was a fine movie and entertaining. I loved Ford as the hunter like I said and I always enjoy Hauer. It amazes me this movie did not do better at the box office than it did.

On one hand, I love the atmosphere, costumes, scenery and mood of the entire film. On the other hand, I hate it for its falling short of greatness (in my opinion), and obscure plot.This is the second time I've seen this movie. The first time, I nearly fell asleep. However, I generally enjoyed it, but didn't capture much of the plot. The first time I saw the director's cut. The second time was the final cut. This time around, I found myself thinking halfway into the movie, \"Wait... what the hell is going on here? I don't know where this movie started, and how far I'm into it. Is this a good thing?\" I think the reason for my confusion is that Blade Runner is a very sophisticated film. The entire time, I had this feeling that there is much more going on in scenes than there seems to be. This is Blade Runner's greatest strength, and at the same time, it's greatest weakness.It's no wonder either, considering that the theatrical release was dumbed down, for fear that audiences wouldn't respond to it well. Narration was added, and certain scenes were taken out (which contradicts the point of the entire film). Also, a happier ending was used. I haven't seen the theatrical release, but from what I hear, it's not the original vision. If you're going to see it, you might as well see the post release versions. In terms of storytelling, the final cut is not too different from the director's cut.If you go into this film not knowing anything, and come out apathetic towards the plot, chances are you didn't like it too much. But if you go into it aware of the questions it poses (there aren't really any answers), or you come out of it with many questions, chances are you enjoyed it. The film doesn't do much to pose the questions, even the big question, regarding the main character. There is so much going on in the scenes, but like the film's choice of dark environments, it's very difficult to see.It's hard to discuss Blade Runner and avoid spoilers. There are elements like atmosphere and tone that are much easier to discuss. And this is an area where the film has no problems. The 1982 film's vision of the future is impressive, to say the least. It is easy to see that many works of fiction were inspired by Blade Runner. The neo-metropolitan cityscape, the grim street life and polluted air paint a grim picture. But it's so pretty. I wasn't particularly a fan of the type of atmosphere. I like my pictures with clear, blue skies. Or at least grey skies. But Blade Runner's biggest strength is its success in its setting going from the collective imagination of the people who created the film, to the end result that we see. This is the only area of the film that is outstanding.This is a film where audiences will be very divided. I can see a lot of people saying that it is a bore. They might say that it has no plot, or a dull execution of it. They might say that it moves too slow, or that they expected more emotional satisfaction. \"Where is the humanity in this film?\", they might ask. The film is asking you, \"what is humanity?\" If you care to see what is going on deeper in the scenes, you will end up with a very interesting film, whose bigger questions remain unanswered even today. Either way, however deep you choose to look into the plot and scenes, you must admit, atmospherically, visually, and in terms of tone, this film is a classic.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Its obscure plot is its greatest strength, and its greatest weakness.", "date": "2010-02-05T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2202691"}, {"content": "This is one of my favourite films.

A one of a kind science fiction movie of its time. Ridley Scott delivered something special when he directed this gem using state of the art special effects along with a unique soundtrack, which was provided by the most beloved composer Vangelis. Quite frankly this film was way ahead of its time because of specific scenes that involved flying cars, a gritty landscape or overly tall buildings that shadowed Los Angeles's citizens like dark slabs of death.Beautifully crafted were Douglas Trumbulls' flying vehicles along with high tech gadgetry that Dekkard (Harrison Ford) uses in finding his targets, which are called Replicants. They are Illegal humanoids used for off world colonies as slave labour, but a group of such slaves escape, then head for earth in order to find their creator Doctor Tyrell (Joe Turkel) in order to extend their lives because each one has a four year life span. The most desperate among them is Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) who leads them through the city streets of Los Angeles finding each specialist who had a hand in creating the Replicants.Tasked with finding Tyrell for an audience Roy discovers a man who is a genetic designer, and Roy convinces him albeit a tenuous request finally attains his goal of speaking with his creator. This film has all the ingredients of a great detective story. Harrison Ford delivers a poignant role as the smooth talking blade runner pairing up with Rachel (Sean Young) who only just realizes that she too is a Replicant but she did not even know it. The movie has action to a degree to keep it as a refined detective tale, with good chase scenes, clue finding, plus a moral code embedded inside to show us why it is so wrong to enslave life, no matter if they are human or not.What was also interesting about this movie during the last scene was when Roy Batty who spoke to Dekkard on the rooftop of a building at the end of their cat and mouse game, was that Rutger Hauer delivered his final lines totally ad-Libbed surprising even Harrison Ford from the reaction he displayed. It worked so well that Ridley Scott decided to call it a wrap once Roy died.Blade Runner has become one of the most beloved classics of all time mainly for its incredible cast, music, special effects, story line, and brute sequences of action. For the international version, which is the original theatrical release it helps the viewer understand what Ridley wanted as far as emotional content was concerned. Such as a scene where Pris (Daryl Hannah) was shot by Dekkard multiple times then started to violently spasm on the hard cold wood floor screaming beyond all measure trying to keep alive. It was one of the most potent scenes in movie history, which surprised Ford as he watched Hannah wriggling so grossly.This is what made Blade Runner the most desired film of all time for viewers alike. Raw, stark emotions, gritty landscapes, beautifully crafted flight sequences provided by Douglas Trumbull who by the way worked on 2001 a space odyssey, as well as Close Encounters of the Third Kind treating us to the mind bending space crafts as well as the mother ship. Since the inception of Blade Runner Ridley has been working on a sequel, which will surprise fans all over the world with Blade Runner 2049. A new twist to the most adored sci-fi adventure in movie history. I highly recommend this film for detective, sci-fi fans like myself.

Rick is the greatest of all his dramatic ciphers, someone existing to connect the dots that can barely be seen at all. Watch him struggle to stay on two legs, physically and psycho-emotionally, as you can never really imagine Indiana Jones, Han Solo or the creepy man he played in \"The Conversation\" trying to similarly keep their heads above water. He's a man truly alone even in a crowd, that probably has a dozen thoughts competing for room in his overloaded brain all the time.Ridley Scott has made a feast for graphic designers, with every shot holding some image that makes you go, \"wow!\" I was shocked when buying a video game system a while back that there wasn't a \"Blade Runner\" game display advertising all the big companies on board with cheapening the memories of this landmark for the sake of money.

Blade Runner is one of these films. Over the years this film has acquired the status of a religious cult, something almost akin to Scientology or Objectivism, and so its difficult to simply dismiss it as long, slow, tedious and overrated. Let me start by comparing this film to other \"sci-fi\" movies. Scott's previous 'Alien' struck a precarious balance between commerce and art - not as hopelessly shallow as Star Wars, and yet hardly as ambitious as 2001. Blade Runner abandons the traditional narrative style altogether; it communicates almost entirely through images, symbols and motifs, and it has a loopy, splintered, chaotic, upside-down narrative pattern.The future is incredibly bleak. Corporations rule the roost. The government and police are totalitarian. A new type of technology allows us to play God - to CREATE human beings, and USE them for our purposes. And then to KILL them, once they cease to be useful, or before they acquire enough volition to become dangerous. The central question seems to be - who is truly human, the \"clones\" or the \"natural\" people ? The powerful seem to be inhuman in their exploitation of the clones, and the people on the lower rungs of the social ladder tend to be robotic in their behavior, since they are powerless and live only to follow orders. And so, as a friend remarks, the main idea here seems to be that the clones are the ONLY humans, since they are the final victims of a vicious cycle, and they alone experience any authentic emotions at all.First the pros. Money has been spent, and some shots are absolutely amazing. The remastered Final Cut is dazzling to look at in Blu-Ray. If you love production design, photography and original visual effects, you will be in heaven. Its obvious, however, that no consensus was reached during pre-production on what the final film was going to be. Now come the cons. Recall how streamlined and systematic 'Alien' was; Blade Runner sits on the opposite extreme of the discipline scale. No care has been tendered on producing a cogent, coherent screenplay. Shot composition and editing are terrible : the timing and sequencing of consecutive shots is shockingly bad, resulting in a distracting, unfocused and overly long narrative that will not appeal to most viewers. Terrible choice of music that works only for one scene (the \"tears in the rain\" speech). Another thing that is, in retrospect, a failure, is the casting and acting. All the actors are consistently, terrifically bad.Blade Runner is a movie that will mean different things to different people. I don't think this is a film that communicates well at all.

This is a prime example of neo-noir cinema with its consistently dark setting, lots of smoking and Harrison Ford's world-weary voice over. Ford plays Deckard, a Blade Runner who's job is to hunt down artificial people known as replicants who used as off world slave labour but aren't permitted on Earth. A group of them have returned and are trying to find their creator. Initially we don't know why they have returned but soon learn that they were built to last only four years and as their time is running out they seek a way to fix themselves.In his pursuit of them he is sent to see the head of the Tyrell corporation, who had designed the replicants. Here Deckard is introduced to Tyrell's assistant Rachael who unbeknownst to her is also a replicant who has been implanted with false memories. When she learns what she is she seeks Deckard again to discover what he knows.When the film starts we know that Deckard is clearly the hero of the film and the replicants, lead by Roy Batty played by Rutger Hauer are the villains but as the film progresses that idea becomes less certain. After all all they want is a life that isn't artificially shortened.The acting from Ford and Sean Young, as Rachael is very good but it is Rutger Hauer who steals the show as the enigmatic Batty, his finally speech is one of the great film speeches.

The entire ambiance is shown well, Kudos to everyone involved...wouldn't be easy to do that in 1982. I doubt if this film will stand the test of time though!\"Sean Young almost too beautiful to believe in this...\", some one said this and rightly so.

I realize this film has a big following and is extremely popular in some circles but I was unable to get with it.No complaints about the performances or casting. Take Sean Young. If you took a talented sculptor, asked him to close his eyes for a few minutes and dream up the most beautiful woman imaginable, he might come up with someone with Sean Young's features. Well, throw in her unimpeachable body too. You'd have to instruct the sculptor carefully though. None of this \"interesting\" business, just plain gorgeous, get it? Forget the Mona Lisa or Eakins' wife. Think Betty and Veronica.You can't sculpt acting talent, lamentably, but in this case it doesn't matter. Anything low normal or above will do. Sean Young is all glossed up in a hyper-Hollywood manner. Her eyes carefully darkened, her lips a deep and shiny cherry red. Even bald, she looks just fine.Obviously a lot of effort and imagination have gone into this movie, but what, really, is it all about? A government hit man is hired to find and terminate half a dozen evidently violent robots who are developing human traits. But, suppose the hit man, Harrison Ford, and the object of his intentions, Sean Young, feel attracted towards one another? These robots appear to eat and do commit other acts of biological interest although why that was programmed into them is problematic. Interesting question that has been raised often before.In any case, when the broth is reduced, it's a pretty slow movie. Some suspense and a good deal of romance. I didn't get much out of it, didn't really care about the characters, but don't want to advise anyone to avoid it. If you peaked on Scale 8 of the original Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory. Or -- well, you'd have to go to a lot of trouble to find that out.

On the surface it may seem like an action movie, but when looked into more closely what can be seen is a deeply philosophical allegory on the concept of life. It's a gripping story of 'Blade Runner' detective Rick Deckard, hunting Replicants; robot slaves who have gone AWOL and returned to earth seeking one thing: a longer life after being designed with a four year life span. The setting, a rain soaked, neon hazed futuristic 2019 LA oozes an overpopulated, multi cultured, crime ridden world, thus giving the film a more dangerous and seedy feel. It's a world that looks like it's been lived in for a long long time, and for a film made in 1982 was way ahead of it's time and still looks impressive today. The casting is pitch perfect, with Ford giving a strong, tough yet vulnerable presence as the uncertain Deckard, torn between killing Replicants yet falling in love with one. Rutger Hauer gives one of the best performances I have ever seen as the violent Roy Batty, who, though may seem frightening, evokes a sense of pity as the audience discover all this man really wants is more life. Rachael, the Replicant Deckard falls for, is played by Sean Young and she both succeeds in being absolutely beautiful yet giving off a robotic aura as she interacts with Deckard. The rest of the cast all put in amazing performances, notable mentions including Edward James Olmos as Gaff, Joe Turkel as Tyrell and the other Replicants.Vangelis' soundtrack fits perfectly with the setting created in Blade Runner, whether showing swooping dazzling cityscape shots, or dim close-ups inside Deckard's shadowy apartment. It's tones, ranging from mellow, jazzy piano and horns to tender electrical synthesisers complement all the scenes perfectly, evoking the dark urban world on display. Overall, for many Blade Runner is not only one of the best in science fiction but also one of the best films of all time. Considering it's difficult creation and eventful history, all the cast and crew, particularly director Ridley Scott, excelled themselves to bring us this wonderful piece of film-making that today still makes audiences question what it is to be human. \"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.\" Roy's famous quote could indeed be repeated when describing what Blade Runner is and has become.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 4, "votes": 8}, "heading": "Visually stunning, thought provoking and incredibly moving.", "date": "2009-09-18T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2128704"}, {"content": "Blade Runner in any version is an excellent movie, and I've now seen 4 versions - the original theatrical release, the little-seen \"compromise cut\", the Director's Cut, and now the Final Cut. If you've seen the DC, there's not much in the FC which makes it essential, other than a few digital tweaks and some polishing of continuity.One reason I'd feared the Final Cut for two years is that I'd heard that Ridley Scott definitively resolved the question of Deckard's own nature (making the movie conform to statements he's made in public), but I prefer to leave the issue ambiguous. I needn't have worried, it seems.Anyone who has seen the movie and still thinks of Replicants as \"machines\" is repeating Deckard's own mistake from early in the movie. \"More Human Than Human\" is an apt description. They have been engineered, while we in \"real life\" have been assembled haphazardly over millions of years, but they rely on the same physical, biological processes we do. If you prick them, do they not bleed? If you wrong them, do they not revenge? The Tyrell Corp. does not manufacture robots, it creates human life. But instead of our own three-score-and-ten, Replicants are \"born\" and die in only four years.I've never taken Bryant's explanation of the 4-year lifespan, as he explains it to Deckard, as truth. From Tyrell's meeting with Roy, I believe that HE speaks truth - \"You were made as well as we could make you.\" The nature of Homo fabricans, though, is such that it CAN'T live longer than 48 months. So Tyrell took what had been an unavoidable limitation in his creation, and sold it as a Special Design Feature - the fail-safe.So in the end, it really doesn't matter whether Deckard is or is not a Replicant. Either way, he and Roy are the same, and the end comes when both of them realize that.If my theory is true, of course, then the happy ending tacked onto the studio release \"Rachael is a special case - no termination date\" is unsupportable. As the couple flee, there's no hope for \"happily ever after\", but there remains the prospect of being together for as long as they both shall live, and of course EITHER of them could get hit by a truck next time they cross the street... \"It's too bad she won't live.

Most people who give this movie a good rating all say the same thing. The movie makes you think on some deep philosophical questions. This is quoted from a review by joelhoff. \"Among the themes explored are the following: - The dehumanization of people through a society shaped by technological and capitalistic excess. - The roles of creator and creation, their mutual enslavement, and their role reversal, i.e., the creation's triumph over its creator. - The nature of humanity itself: emotions, memory, purpose, desire, cruelty, technological mastery of environment and universe, mortality, death, and more. - Personal identity and self-awareness. - The meaning of existence.\" I think that every bit of that is BS. Technological and capitalistic excess would also be said of us right now by people who lived 50 years ago. Not all technological advances are considered excess. The roles of creator and creation and their role reversal. There is no role reversal. The replicants died. They didn't triumph. A triumph for the replicants would have been a normal life span, which is why the sought out their creator. The nature of humanity is not emotion, memory, purpose, blah blah. If you look through a few history books you'll see the nature of humanity is about power. The most powerful live and and the weak die. I'm sure most will consider this a very cynical viewpoint but do you honestly believe that the powerful care about your emotions. The meaning of existence is death.The only thing that made me stop and think was when Deckard went from calling Rachael an \"it\" to asking her if she loved him. His character went from believing her to be worthless tool to wanting to protect her. But then again, the movie did not show any relationship development between the two, so that was completely unexpected and a bit insincere.I don't believe this to be a great sci fi movie.

I did some research and learnt that Sir Run Run Shaw, credited in the film, is a Chinese media mogul, who must have been around 90 when the film Blade Runner was made. I have read a not bad sequel, but there seems to be no interest in creating a movie sequel based on the book sequel, which I think is kind of sad, because despite the often dim witted script, the film had interesting visuals.

It even made the revised version of the AFI's Top 100 American Films.When released in 1982, Blade Runner flopped at the box office and sharply divided critics. Its technical brilliance was universally acknowledged, however many critics believed the film lacked a real human story and depth in its dramatic nature. Even eminent American critic Roger Ebert felt the film failed on a 'human level', although he somewhat revised his opinions years later.Well I strongly disagree with this interpretation of the film - after all, this is a cautionary tale about the accelerating mechanisation of our society, the unsustainable expansion of the world and the increasing grasp of massive corporations. The film's elements range from subtle philosophical dilemmas such as 'What makes a human a human?' 'What constitutes existence?\" An allusion to these dilemmas is offered by Pris (Daryl Hannah), who is a Replicant when she utters Rene Descartes' signature dictum: \"I think therefore I am\". Or when Roy (Rutger Hauer) quotes Nietzsche (\"I've seen things\") in his monologue at the end of the film. Blade Runner has depth and multiple layers to it, which I suspect would be fully discovered if the film is watched multiple times.Los Angeles, 2019 - Oppressively high rise temples soar up into the occluded and polluted skies of LA. Acid Rain collects between the neon-illuminated fissures that separate the colossal buildings. The city is a hybrid of races (there is nothing sci-fi about that) and the city's poor are enslaved in infected dwellings on ground level, while the rich are secluded in their skyscrapers or the very rich have escaped into \"off world colonies\", where they profit from Replicants who they use as slave labour. The Tyrell Corporation makes Replicants exactly like humans and injects them with a lifespan of 4 years, because they collect too many memories and acquire to much human experience, making them dangerously human. Can these artificial beings become humans? They feel, they smell, they are emotionally attached, does that matter? The film centres on a Blade Runner assigned to \"decommision\" a few Replicants who escaped back to Earth, which is strictly prohibited. As the film progresses, we wonder is Deckard a Replicant, if so he is indistinguishable. This film is the grittier, darker more violent 80s version of Kubrick's '2001'. It is an astonishing achievement.The film was overshadowed upon release by the dominance of 'ET: The Extra Terrestrial', another masterpiece by Spielberg, but one that offers more comforting qualities than Scott's probing epic.10/10", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Visually intoxicating - Blade Runner is a prophetic sci-fi masterpiece and one of the greatest films ever made", "date": "2009-08-06T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2107339"}, {"content": "In 2019 Blade Runner Deckard (Ford) is hired to track down and retire numerous replicants, slaves who have come to earth seeking their constructor.Almost 30 years on Blade Runner is renowned as a classic, despite bombing in theatres when first released, but significantly all the attention is what happened behind closed doors for this sci-fi smash.There have been riffs between Scott and his apparent distance to his crew, the central star argued whether Deckard was human or not but what is most debated still is this whole business with specific cuts.First there was an unapproved director's cut, and then in the early 90's Scott did his own version with the latest cut and apparent finale being released two years ago.Having watched the director's cut, and my first viewing of the film, a few months previously I was left spellbound by the attractive graphics, the gritty and mind conceptual nature of the sharp scripting amongst the usual bravado performance by the Star Wars hero Harrison Ford.One of the debates is the inclusion of Ford's narration. Now the final cut does not include any of this apparent narration and I am unable to recall how much was included in the director's cut but ultimately from my perspective the absence is a powerful thing as we are left to work out the complexions of Deckard's nature.The opening sequence explains the facts regarding replicants and Blade Runners with a soulful futuristic vibe playing in the background. We then open to a futuristic Los Angeles with numerous towers on fire and a splendid montage of a fiery eye that sets the tone for a noir styled futuristic film.After a sharp murder Deckard is hired to kill the remaining replicants and is soon on a detective style trail to exploit the activities of their creator with Rachel (Young) applying the necessary rivalry and challenge for Deckard.Amongst all the terms and relevance of the time, this is quite a silent movie with Ford's masculine figure saying what he only needs to and creating that soulful presence he does so well. Young balances the actor with her inside numbness whilst Hauer is perhaps the most intriguing character, being evil but with a purpose and significance.Ridley Scott's direction takes in mind the complexity of reality for the future with the crowded streets, the development of the replicants and working a constricted tale for Deckard to try and master.This is all about the humanity in the future and how machines hinder our options and possibilities.

Like its source novel, it has a few good ideas, more bad ones, a thin plot, trite and leaden dialogue, and poor characterizations, made all the worse by mediocre to bad acting, from the always overrated Ford, to the abysmal Young, to the over the top Hauer (aptly demonstrated by his silly soliloquy) to the lifeless Hannah (both of whose portrayals do nothing to engender sympathy for the Replicants), to the quirk-infested Olmos. Add in the chemistry lacking love story between Ford and Young, and the far too long sequences designed to simply show off the visuals and inner workings of Tyrell's corporation, the muddled plot (especially in the later non-voice-over versions), and the film is a classic triumph of 'style over substance.' Even that clich\u00e9 grates, despite its aptness. Granted, it would not surprise me if claimants of the Deckard as Relicant posit point to the chemistry lacking love story as proof that both characters are inhuman, but Occam's Razor points to the simpler interpretation that it's just bad acting and writing.Similarly, the overall film ultimately falls far short of its claimed greatness because it simply is never sure of what it wants to be- another strike against its 'visionary' claims. It has too many feet on too many boats that diverge- is it sci fi, is it existential, is it film noir, is it a character study? In truth, it has elements of all these and more, but not enough of any of them to make it work as one, much less all of these. In fact, the chief failing, on all scores, for this film, is that Ridley Scott really had no vision for the project, grafting elements from Alien and many of the other films mentioned in this essay, trying to take what worked from each, and ending up with a film that, in many ways, is a mess, and a dull one, at that.

I'd rate it as one of my favorite sci-fi movies now. Seeing it again made me understand it in a way I hadn't before.The atmosphere of the movie is engrossing. The Los Angeles of the future is nearly constantly rainy, dark, and swirling with fog. People walk away down streets with black umbrellas and a self-preserving, alienated kind of hurry. Lighted billboards for Coca Cola and Atari cut through the darkness (which oddly doesn't feel out of place). It definitely resonates film noir in a way rarely seen in movies today. The almost surreal visuals are a perfect match for the soundtrack by Vangelis. The mixture of synthesizer and saxophone definitely augments the futuristic '40s feel.Harrison Ford as Deckard is actually really good. It seems like an odd role for him measured against Star Wars and Indiana Jones, but I think his understated presence in this is welcome vs. the action-star-going-in-shooting feel of some of his other roles.Sean Young as Rachael does very well also. Her femme fatale character wouldn't have looked out of place in the Maltese Falcon, in my opinion. Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty had one of the most haunting monologues I've ever heard in a movie. Really. Watch it for yourself. It's unbelievable.As for the two versions of the movie, the voice-over and non-voice-over version, I've seen both and don't really have a preference. I think both stand up well on their own merits. The voice-over version, even if Harrison Ford delivered it somewhat lamely, does fill in the cracks usefully and keeps to the detective-on-the-case format. The non-voice-over version is like 2001: A Space Odyssey in that it leaves more up to imagination and interpretation.I'll watch this movie many more times and still never figure it out.

I think it isn't that in \"Blade Runner\" the Replicants are human too, they are the ONLY humans.Deckard, the three scientists who are in charge of designing, the eyes, the body, and the brains, of the Replicants, and Edward James Olmos, are all just doing their job. They exist to serve a function, and to perform a task and they do so, like machines. The scientists are practically on an assembly line, each designing a piece, so as not to comprehend the meaning of the whole. \"The eyes are the window to the soul\" Rutger Haur notes, meeting the man who designed his eyes, yet this man knows nothing. The first image in Blade Runner, is a close up on eye with the city reflected from it, as if within the soul there is nothing but a dark city full of smog, fire, and billboards (eyes and screens are recurrent visual motif that come up again and again in this). The first view we are introduced to, the perspective is that of someone whose soul contains nothing, but a reflection of the world around them.Deckard is a little annoyed that he has to come out of retirement, but what are you gonna do, \"your not us, your little people\" as his boss tells him. Only the replicants ask human questions and are driven by human desires like who am I, why do I exist, how can I escape death. For PKD and Ridley Scott, it would seem, these are the fundamental questions which all sentient beings must ask themselves, in order to become human. Without which we lose what makes us any more than biological furniture. \"More human than human is our motto\", as the good doctor says about his clone factory.Deckard and the rest of the future, is trapped in a constant darkness where the sun never comes up and the only light comes from giant advertisements, that absorb the landscape into themselves. People scurry about like ants (unconcerned or unaware of the world around them), and even Deckard who has the benefit of not being \"little people\" spends his time, like a burn out film noir detective, in a dim apartment, killing time.The Replicants have become more human than the human beings. They like Deckard used to kill for a living, but abandoned that for the possibility of something more, which he has not. Their actions are driven by a need to live as something more than an object and body. Theirs is an existential ordeal, in a world of economic determinism. Their actions though possibly futile are still authentic, they are their actions, and no one else's. Hauer killing off his creator, is a little like Don Quixote fighting off his windmills, an absurd waste of energy, though it's Hauer's awareness and Quixote's lack there of, which defines them as a character, and human beings.We assume that since Harrison Ford is the lead we are supposed to empathize with him, which I imagine is where all the irrelevant conjecture about him being a replicant comes from. It doesn't matter if he is or isn't, because the real criterion for humanity is not birthright, but performance. It's only through meeting the scientists assistant who doesn't know she is a replicant, is he faced with doing something that violates his \"social programming\". By the end it's implied, that he will save the woman, risking himself for someone who will only live four or five years anyway.He has recognized not just that Hauer or those he killed were real thinking people like himself, but that they in fact were better than him, closer in classic terms to being authentic people(\"the unexamined life is not worth living\"etc), because at least they know they are fake, and chose to struggle anyway. Only when faced with artificial reproductions of ourselves (be it robots, stories, paintings, photos, movies, sculpture, etc), do we get a reflection of what is to be human.Or as one of my favorites PKD quotes, says in other words \"So we and our elaborately evolving computers may meet each other halfway. Someday a human being, named perhaps Fred White, may shoot a robot named Pete Something-or-other, which has come out of a General Electric factory, and to his surprise see it weep and bleed. And the dying robot may shoot back and, to its surprise, see a wisp of gray smoke arise from the electric pump that it supposed was Mr. White's beating heart. It would be rather a great moment of truth for both of them.\" So not exactly an \"I, Robot\" film about robo-equal rights, or a Matrix cautionary 'the machines will get us\" story. Instead Ridley Scott shows us a world where human beings are less than machines, more privileged, colder, less aware, and without compassion, and does so in a visual landscape unlike anything movies had seen before", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "\"More Human Than Human is Our Motto\"", "date": "2009-04-28T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2058990"}, {"content": "Lost in world of future - devoid of memories, comments, blogs - everything electronic and superficial.

Another thing I loved about it is the way the cars were moving in the air as well.The electronic music score by Vangelis, I think, matched the mood of the entire film in such a great way, since it is set in the future.I have heard it's a shame book fanatics seem to like this film, because this film happens to be based on a book called \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sleep\" by Phillip K. Dick, and it doesn't follow the book exactly.It's also a shame Harrison Ford (who played Rick Deckard) didn't like this movie, but Rutger Hauer did. It's also a shame it did not do very well upon its initial release, but it has become a valid cult classic and one of the best science-fiction films ever.I thought this movie was just so interesting, everything about it changed my life forever and made a big impact on me.As of what I said, I would recommend this movie highly for anybody to watch (not children though, because of its parental rating).

I've been hearing about this movie for years, I always wondered why so many people have said good things about it, yet I doubted it could be really as good as they said it was, mostly because it was made in 1982. After watching Natural City which is based on Blade Runner I decided to finally watch Blade Runner and I'm glad I did.From the very start of the movie I felt like I just got into a roller coaster but this was a special roller coaster because instead of many ups and downs this ride was exhilarating from start to finish. At the beginning of the movie you're given a fly-over of the city of Los Angeles in 2019, I was amazed at how beautiful it was.It's interesting to note how far-off the director was with the level of technology we will be having by 2019, back then people thought we'd have flying cars by the year 2000, but look at us we're in 2009 and still no flying cars and still depending on archaic oil for fuel. However the director's error in judgement thankfully doesn't distract from the movie at all.Blade Runner is about replicants, artificial humanoid life forms that are virtually identical to humans, who were created for the purpose of slave labor and colonization of other planets. When a group of replicants betrayed their human masters in an off-world planet all replicants were banned from Earth. A special police unit designated as Blade Runner were given the mission to hunt for replicants on Earth and \"retire\" them.The camera-work in this movie was excellent, it makes you feel like you are a part of the movie. When the main character is walking in the city you feel as if you're walking next to him. When he's in a flying car you feel like if you're flying next to him, it's a wonderful experience, you get a sense of what it would be like to live in that city.The only negative I can think of for this movie is that it only lasts two hours, I wanted it to go on for at least two more hours, that's how good the movie was.

Add to that the most anti-climactic ending in existence and you've got a real \"Wha?\" film. OK, so it's not what I was expecting.

But do you get sixty minutes of atmospheric shots spliced in between twenty five minutes of conversation that seems to leading up to something (but surprise! never does) and five minutes of two confusing fight scenes. I'll give Blade Runner credit, though: the setting is visionary, convincing and appropriately claustrophobic. I had no problem getting absorbed into the retro sci-fi setting, but maybe that's just me. The acting is just good as well, but Harrison Ford's narration is dry and robotic for some reason. Seems out of place in a film where he acts perfectly fine everywhere else. But the bottom line is this film toys with your mind. It makes you think each event is leading up to something when nothing ever does. ******SPOILER ALERT****** And the scene in the apartment? Is Ford trying to rape the female replicant? It's really hard to understand what's going on there. He gets hot over her, tries to make a move, she tries to escape, he stops her and makes her say she wants it.

I don't like Queen, but grudgingly recognise the quality of their music; I happen to 'like' Beethoven, while also recognising that his music is truly and almost timelessly great (albeit some will not appreciate it or like it). Blade Runner falls into that category of film that is technically great yet will divide opinion, more than many films, at the personal or emotional level. I can quite see why it will leave some cold (and hence scored at 1, 2, or 3 out of 10). There is little action as such; the plot requires imagination and reconstruction on the part of the viewer; the moral ambiguity requires a deeper, almost philosophical, level of understanding and reflection. In many ways, it is like listening to a symphony; or rather it requires a similar mode of appreciation. It could quite easily leave one cold and/or confused.

The most predominant of which was what will become of us if we allow the media to control us. The film represents 21st century life as a dystopian wasteland controlled by the censor, were our lives are pre-determined and were we can't turn a street corner without being confronted with a garish advertisement, none of which was a real problem back in 1982 when the movie was released. Which is why today's audiences have managed to connect so wonderfully with this movie. The neo-noir classic has a visual flair unmatched by any other film, not only in it genre, but quite possibly of all time. These days, it's almost impossible to find a gritty science fiction motion picture that doesn't owe at least a small debt to Blade Runner's visual style. And yet this manages effortlessly to balance both its substance and its style perfectly. Each character is fleshed out perfectly, each giving depth and insight to the grand scheme of it all.A blend of science fiction and noir detective fiction, Blade Runner (1982) was a box office and critical bust upon its initial exhibition, but its unique postmodern production design became hugely influential within the sci-fi genre, and the film gained a significant cult following that increased its stature. Harrison Ford stars as Rick Deckard, a retired cop in Los Angeles circa 2019. L.A. has become a pan-cultural dystopia of corporate advertising, pollution and flying automobiles, as well as replicants, human-like androids with short life spans built by the Tyrell Corporation for use in dangerous off-world colonization. Deckard's former job in the police department was as a talented blade runner, a euphemism for detectives that hunt down and assassinate rogue replicants. Called before his one-time superior (M. Emmett Walsh), Deckard is forced back into active duty.A quartet of replicants led by Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) has escaped and headed to Earth, killing several humans in the process. After meeting with the eccentric Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel), creator of the replicants, Deckard finds and eliminates Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), one of his targets. Attacked by another replicant, Leon (Brion James), Deckard is about to be killed when he's saved by Rachael (Sean Young), Tyrell's assistant and a replicant who's unaware of her true nature. In the meantime, Batty and his replicant pleasure model lover, Pris (Darryl Hannah) use a dying inventor, J.F. Sebastian (William Sanderson) to get close to Tyrell and murder him. Deckard tracks the pair to Sebastian's, where a bloody and violent final confrontation between Deckard and Batty takes place on a skyscraper rooftop high above the city. In 1992, Ridley Scott released a popular director's cut that removed Deckard's narration, added a dream sequence, and excised a happy ending imposed by the results of test screenings; these legendary behind-the-scenes battles were chronicled in a 1996 tome, Future Noir: The Making of Blade Runner by Paul M. Sammon.Verdict: Blade Runner remains a dark masterpiece exploringandroid slavery and the decay of the human condition. Its visceral imagery of afuturistic and dystopian Los Angeles sticks with you for life.

Scotts direction is masterful as always and some of the sequences create a crackling atmosphere of genuine suspense. where Scott excels is in cutting from one scene to a striking image in the next, for example Roys inhumanly clenching fist or a delicately made origami sculpture. the score is perfectly suited to the film and so evocative of the time and place, it really enhances The scenes focusing on the wasted cityscape of 2019 LA.

More action to be precise. And there is a good reason for that. The title \"Blade Runner\" \u0096 It just don't sound like a \"deep\" and \"philosophical\" movie. Secondly, the poster looks like it's a fast action movie \u0096 with Deckard looking alert holding his gun up. 20 years later the final cut is released and I must say that this last version is beautiful. The flyovers and panorama views through the film are astounding, taking to account it was made in 1982. And there is still that ever present feeling of emptiness. But still \u0096those are nearly the only things i like about it. The acting is too cartoonish. The replicants look so robot-like that a device for detecting them seems unnecessary. Then there are several examples of things that are changed to look futuristic - like the neon umbrellas. They look so ridiculous it makes my toes curl. Plastic coats (seems like a bad idea in a humid environment like that) etc. etc. The pace of the story is mostly so dragging slow. And that is not because we need to admire the settings, no the story is just not good enough for a full movie. Deckard needs to find 4 replicants and kill them. That he does, one at a time, without any interesting storytelling. He falls in love with a (girl) replicant. And then it ends. It is just too simple to be interesting.

Dick's 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep' vision of the future, I stand amazed this was the one chosen for a film adaptation. Asimov, Clarke, Heinlein, Gifford, Patterson...others, have written reams of sci-fi(?) future history stories, any number of which would produce an enjoyable and intellectually-stimulating celluloid. In defense, however, Dick's tight, concise and mentally-graphic storytelling are the product of specific genius. The fact that director Scott and his 3-D, art-directed team 'got' Dick's vision is testament to adaptability from a great story line for film. In truth, a movie version of any of the aforementioned treatises would have forced a monstrous series of film productions instead of a regular, two-hour viewing conducive to a regular movie-going event (with few exceptions, 'series' often fail to produce box-office monies from the original construct).Having said that, Dick's tough storyline, the resultant and beautiful screen-play, art direction, studio and on-location construction, and Scott's direction, have made 'Blade Runner' a euphoric and time-honored cult classic. The fact that this was Hollywood's last, great effort on an analogue film (no special effects were produced by computer generation - unknown then) bears witness to true 'on-film' making graphical expertise. Cutting-edge, then, and still stands triumphant in spite of its age.In addition - and strongly in merit - the concept of hearkening a film-noir essence from the 30's to exact the nuances of a distopian future history, tied directly to an American republic past, is pure genius. All the un-loosed ends of our civil problems: overpopulation, corporeal greed, castration of civil rights, global pollution...illegal governmental intravention...illegal aliens...are addressed one way or another in this dark, emotionally-charged but lens-clear vision of the multi-cultered American vision of our global future. It's as if the roots of our fatherhood slowly stood within the movie theatre and silently applauded, reckoning a civil duty. A film, and vision, vastly ahead of its time...In any movie, the music 'sets the tone' for its ambiance. Audiences as a whole - and individually - identify the theme of a film from its music. Scott was adroit in his choice of 'Vengelis' (Evangelos Odysseas Papathanassiouas) as the film's music author. A Greek music composer and self-taught musician (he has sold over 20 million albums), Vangelis is 65 years old now, and has understood - inimitably - the essence of film thematic music (he is an absolute 'film buff'). When you listen to his efforts to construct the theme music for this film (see, 2nd disc 'Blade Runner - The Final Cut'), you'll understand his pathos for this movie. One of the ultimate decisions to include this film within my 'All Time' favorites is Evangelos' empathetic and counter-point music, deftly underscoring the harsh realities of the film.

From the first time I saw it back in the summer of 1982 I disliked it. Maybe it was because I'd spent the previous year or so seeing trailers and \"making of\" segments that made it look so good that basically nothing could possibly live up to such expectations (and what could be better than ALIEN?)Then there were Deckard's square glasses (you can't drink well out of a square glass), all that tedious smoky light drifting through blinds, and that dove being released in slow motion to make us feel just so\u0085whatever.I guess I do know why I spent so many years disliking it.Yet, slow motion dove notwithstanding, I find this new cut tremendously entertaining. I never imagined that more explicitly making Deckard a replicant could make it so much more fun. (Okay, here it is for the sceptics: Gaff's origami unicorn tells us he knows Deckard dreams of unicorns. He could only know this if said dreams were implants) Sure, it was always in the mix that Deckard was potentially a replicant. People suggested as much back in '82. The suspicion is alluded to in the movie \u2013 \"Have you ever tried taking that test yourself?\"Now we know for sure. He's a robot and his memory is false. This makes almost everything about the early part of the film wonderfully weird. It opens up the possibility that when Deckard is brought into the police station and speaks with Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh), that this is the first time these two men have ever spoken! \"I need the old magic,\" Bryant tells him. But there is no old magic. Deckard's complicated, perhaps tragic, in any case mysterious, personal history doesn't exist. Bryant has been told to speak to Deckard as if they'd known each other for years. By who? By higher ups. By people at the Tyrell Corp. maybe. In any case, it's made perfectly clear that replicants equipped with memory implants are a new model. Very new, like not even on the market yet. I know a lot of fans buy into the \"Deckard is a replicant\" reading, while at the same time wanting to imagine him as a grizzled old veteran cop, with years of experience under his belt. But I don't think you can have it both ways. If he is a replicant, he is necessarily new. Just off the assembly line, like Rachel must be.Similarly, when we see Deckard going into his apartment, after his visit to the Tyrell Corporation, this is the first time he has ever entered this apartment. He only knows his way around it, and who the people in his photographs are, because of the memory implants.Obviously, if you prefer, you can imagine Deckard as a week old replicant, or a month old replicant, but I don't know why you would. There'd be no point in having an expensive replicant drifting through the city reading the want ads for a few weeks, looking for a job his manufacturers know he'll never take. No. It's much more fascinatingly twisted to watch this character do for the first time things he thinks he's been doing for years. He gives Rachel the VOIGHT-KAMPFF test. He's never given a Voight-Kampff test before. He makes a phone call. He has never made a phone call before. And, of course, he has never killed anyone.This way of interpreting Deckard's actions is provocative not necessarily because it's so radically different a take on reality from what we're used to, but because it's a play on a dynamic that's so absolutely common. The main character's backstory is fictional in every movie. It's the stuff all screenplays are made of. The first time we catch sight of a character in a movie is, effectively, the first time he or she has ever really existed. Backstory is a thing we the audience believe in to create for ourselves that sense of reality or continuity which narrative so depends on.For instance, when The Maltese Falcon opens Sam Spade and his partner Miles Archer are sitting around their office. They're partners. They've known and trusted each other for years. They're worked on numerous cases together. But, of course, they haven't really. They only act like they have. It's just a movie. They don't exist prior to the first scene in it. The concept of Deckard's memory implants merely makes this idea much more literal.And making abstract, theoretical ideas literal is something the best science fiction has always been good at. Serious SF has the ability to confront a concept that's fuzzy and hard to wrap your head around and recontextualize it, turning it into something immediate and tangible. One of the proto- Sci-Fi masterpieces, Stephenson's Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde, does this as well as anything. After all, duality within the human soul had been dealt with and analyzed from any number of viewpoints. What Stephenson did was make the abstraction of moral duality more easily viewable by making it a much more real, immediate situation in which his main character experiences the extremes of this duality in clearly distinguishable personalities struggling for control within himself. False personal backstory isn't the only abstraction BR makes literal.There's no difference between what the replicants want and what anybody else wants. The conflicts that the replicants are struggling with are the same existential issues everyone confronts: I'm going to die. I don't know when. I don't want to. What's so unusual? But the fact that their problems are so essentially run-of-the-mill doesn't make the film less interesting. It makes it more interesting, as it bundles this familiar angst in a shiny new package and, successfully, freshens it up, letting us experience it as something novel and provocative.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 5}, "heading": "Never been there.

Only some rave reviews about the picture quality of this new 5-disc \"Complete Collector's Edition\" enticed me to watch this again. Wow, I am glad; this was a very entertaining and a tremendous visual and audio treat.I actually appreciated the audio best because, even in this new Blu-Ray era, one doesn't often find a film with very active surround speakers. However, this \"restored\" version did and the sound is, at the point, the best I've heard on a Blu-Ray disc....or any DVD, for that matter. The visuals? Well, fans of Blade Runner know all about them. They are fantastic. Scene-after-scene reminded me of a Stanley Kubrick film or another bizarre 1980s movie called \"Jacob's Ladder.\"Because there are so many things to see and hear, and the story is different, one filled with strange characters, I can see where people would watch this film multiple times and enjoy it very much each time. The \"Collector's Edition\" has the best picture ever, according to director Ridley Scott, and \"is the version I'm most pleased with.\" It has added scenes one didn't see in earlier versions. The rest of the DVD has those earlier versions. Apparently, there are several including those with Harrison Ford doing narration, like out of a late '40s film noir.Speaking of the latter, that's what this film looked like: a combination film noir (or neo-noir) and sci-fi movie. It has many dark images, fantastic night-time scenes, wonderful closeups and an always-interesting color palette. Sci-fi films usually get dated in a hurry, thanks to ever-increasing special-effects progress in the movie industry, but this still looks very good. Despite being made over 25 years ago, Blade Runner still looks very much state-of-the-art.Scott says this is the best version and the best his film has ever looked and sounded. Since it's his movie, who am I to argue. So, if you're like me and never gave this movie a chance (I lost interest halfway through with my VHS look at it), give this a second look on this Blu-Ray edition....and you will be blown away.

Those expecting to see a typical Harrison Ford save-the-world-and-rescue-his-family film, or a typical sci-fi special effects blockbuster will be surprised, as they will not be prepared for a film with such dark and brooding undertones. For at the heart of this futuristic sci-fi thriller is a bleak and complex film exploring the darkest and most sombre elements of humanity, and questioning what exactly comprises humanity.BLADE RUNNER exudes atmosphere. Ridley Scott infuses his film with a brooding atmosphere, from the ever-crowded streets, to the giant electronic billboards, to the huge and haunting apartment complexes. The atmosphere effectively sets the tone for this Motion Picture. Cinematography and set design are almost impeccable. Even 26 years after its release, one will still be astounded by Ridley Scott's vision of the future. The electronic score, done exclusively by Vangelis, also goes to great lengths to setting the overall mood for the film.The story itself is a profound and compelling one, but it is the ending that propels this from good to great, and makes this film one of the most widely discussed and debated sci-fi movies of all time. I will not mention the questions that will be posed at the end of the film, for the sake of potential viewers (and due to my spoiler-free nature), but all I will say here is that the film is worth watching at least once, as it is a truly cerebral and rewarding experience; one which no single review can ever truly encompass.On a final note, the acting in this movie is mixed, as the cast (as an ensemble) delivers a rather varied performance. Harrison Ford is as reliable as ever, though he seems a bit out of place in a film of this nature. Rutger Hauer and Darly Hannah (neither of whom I am a fan) deliver perhaps their best ever performances in this film. The rest of the cast is mediocre to poor and not really worth mentioning.Overall, the film deserves a solid 8/10 and 3.5 stars (out of 4). Will enter my Top 200 at #195 or so.

And they get critically acclaimed for it. The best example of this is Fahrenheit 451, which was simply a generic allegory about censorship with a kindergarten-level plot\u0097that is now taught in our schools as one of the greatest novels of all time. What a joke. Blade Runner, at least in film form, is not like that whatsoever, and that was very refreshing to me. Unlike Fahrenheit 451 and the majority of other sci-fi titles, Blade Runner does not just bank on one moral issue. It doesn't create a world around a single issue (like censorship or the value of life or any other clich\u00e9 issues sci-fi always repeats), it creates a world with ISSUES. This is why it's such superior as allegorical sci-fi and as film noir.With this world that is so different from any created before it, Ridley Scott's directing really sets the stage. Though I'm not sure Blade Runner can even be mentioned in the same breath as Alien, it's obvious that the two were directed by the same man. Simply put: Ridley Scott pays attention to details that we as an audience will likely only notice subconsciously.The majority of the negative reviews criticize the slow pace, but the slow pace is what makes Blade Runner what it is. It builds the atmosphere, and if you were to take out even a single scene, the overall movie would lack something. Atmosphere is something modern viewers don't understand. There is a major difference between an action movie filling space with twenty minutes of the main charter staring at a wall and another action filling the same amount of time with slow-paced, atmosphere-building scenes. The former is pointless; the latter is intentional and purposeful. For example, look at The Dark Knight. The pacing is no faster than Blade Runner. In fact, the entire first hour and a half was dedicated to nothing but conveying the one-dimensional plot that we all fully understood since we saw the first trailer. Blade Runner, on the other hand, uses just as much time to immerse the viewer in the unconventional city atmosphere. Scott understands when and how to use music and color. He understands when to give a slow pan of the city and when to blast through the city with action. I find it almost hypocritical than people rave for movies like The Dark Knight and Casino Royale then trash Blade Runner for its pacing\u0097none of them get to the action any faster, and that's fact. If you want a fast pace, go watch Saw. If you want atmosphere, watch Blade Runner. I love both styles, and both styles have their place in cinema.The casting is also flawless. Some people have trashed Harrison Ford's performance, but, really, I don't see what he did so wrong. He plays the same character he does in every movie he plays in: a brute, somewhat childish, selfish man. He plays the character traits just as well as he did in Star Wars and Indiana Jones. The other actors all fulfilled their purposes, and I didn't find their performances terrible or great.Though the directing is godly, I don't judge a movie solely based on movie making quality, unlike some mindless people. The story is pretty generic, with some original facets for its time. The somewhat dull plot is the only reason I didn't give this movie a perfect score. A plot twist would really have improved the standard, somewhat predictable formula. With that said, Blade Runner is far from generic sci-fi, as my opening paragraph stated. It's more intelligent than that, but it doesn't get so lost in a social commentary it loses entertainment value. The last twenty minutes reveal the true adrenaline of the story, after the movie-long build up. It's how Scott directs. It's his staple. And it works. And it's entertaining. If you don't enjoy it, then don't watch it. It's taste, not lack of quality or originality or pointless scenes. Overall, this is a must-view for any sci-fi fan. Anyone who is looking for something to at least fill the nostalgia of Alien, watch Blade Runner. It's not perfect, and the shallow plot is a bit disappointing, but it's still awesome in it's own way, and is far above its imitators.5/10", "rating": 5, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 4}, "heading": "Not the generic, clich\u00e9 film noir the negative reviews wanted, thank God.", "date": "2008-11-29T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1982856"}, {"content": "My kudos to John who had a similar experience with this movie.

No-one has made a movie quite like it before or since.

Sure, it's all been done before, the film noir routine, but here it engages without being too formulaic. The philosophical themes are interesting too providing plenty of questions if you are interested. Mostly: what does it mean to be human? For instance, watch Rachel cry when she finds out she's not human after all. It evokes a form of pity, because, is she really that different from us? Isn't she worthy of a normal life? Aren't we all machines in a way, following the written routines in our own DNA code? Lack of empathy makes the replicants different from humans, but only for older models. And they get more human by the day. When they get too human they expire...the 4 year lifespan. But like any life form, they want survival. More even, to get the maximum out of the whole experience called life.

Its critics accuse it of being all looks and no drama but they've really missed the point; it's also a fantastic story with endlessly fascinating characters and unusual situations. I mean, what other movie ends with the villain saving the hero ? Hampton Fancher and David Peoples' script is a loose but clever adaptation of Philip K. Dick's classic 1968 novel Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep ?, although they stole the title from a more obscure book, The Bladerunner, by Alan E. Nourse. At its core is the concept of the androids' humanity. Deckard tries to rationalise his occupation by referring to them with third person pronouns and cynicism but essentially he's just a killer, and all of the android death scenes are bloody and disturbing. They might not be people, but they live life much more than the rest of the population seem to. Scenes like the one where Deckard teases Rachael with her false memories and she quietly cries at the awfulness of what's been done to her are charged with emotion and tenderness. All of the performances are absolutely first rate in extremely demanding roles; Ford is terrific, Young, Hannah and Olmos are iconic, Turkel hypnotically enigmatic, Sanderson and Cassidy both beautifully tragic, Walsh and Hong are hilariously seedy, and best of all is an unforgettable Hauer as the truly one-of-a-kind Roy Batty. Hauer is Frankenstein's Monster for the modern age, striding through the movie, alternately terrifying, humorous and tragic. His final scene in the rooftop rain is one of the most powerful endings in all cinema, majestically stylised and beautifully acted. Scott is often accused by half-witted detractors of being too focused on the imagery in his films - heaven help us, isn't that what a movie director is supposed to do - tell a story in pictures ? Scott is a genuine, no-apologies, barking-mad genius and this movie is just crammed full of amazing shots - the opening cityscape, the golden Tyrell Building, Deckard's future-noir apartment (which is just about the coolest in any movie), Pris' punk-doll look, the Esper/photo sequence, Roy in the elevator, Roy with the dove, way too many to mention. Movies can be so much more than just talking heads, and when you see one as good as this, I'll be goddamned if it doesn't convince me that Cinema is an Art after all. Add to this an incredibly stylish electronic score by Vangelis which complements the dark, industrial visuals perfectly and you have one of the most imaginative, entertaining and memorable science-fiction films ever made. I'm not going to get into that whole Unicorn dream / replicant Deckard thing because I believe we're free to interpret any movie anyway we want. I do have to say though that I liked the original version with the gumshoe-style narration - I sometimes wish filmmakers wouldn't keep dickering with their work; once it's released, that should be it. Featuring superb photography by Jordan Cronenweth, astounding production design by Lawrence G. Paull (Harlem Nights, Escape From L.A.) and terrific visual effects by Douglas Trumbull, Richard Yuricich and David Dryer, don't miss this fabulous futuristic classic, made with incredible skill and intensity by a truly great filmmaker.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 4}, "heading": "Where Did I Come From ?

Adapted from Phillip K. Dick's 1968 novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, Blade Runner's history is one of a legendarily troubled shoot, and egregious financial disappointment. However, like some other films that experienced such stressful and humble beginnings and ultimately grew in importance and popularity with each passing decade (like Citizen Kane, The Shawshank Redemption, The Wizard of Oz and It's a Wonderful Life), Blade Runner's esteem now with film critics and audiences alike shows that in 1982 it was simply a movie that was decades ahead of its time.Blade Runner is as visually awe-inspiring a movie as you will ever see. Justifiably celebrated for its mesmerizing production design, Scott and his crew, also putting to work visual effects that don't show 26 years, paint a wrenching but no less aesthetically pleasing portrait of what maybe 2019 Los Angeles will look like: dystopic, polluted and brimming with corruption and corporate greed. You could only hope to see such amazing eye-candy from a director who is arguably one of the last true visionary directors (that now being a term which, it seems, is thrown around nearly as much these days in Hollywood circles as \"You'll never work in this town again!\").But therein does not lie that magic ingredient that makes Blade Runner the seminal masterpiece of science-fiction film-making \u2013 that is in two other aspects of the story. The first of those is its ocean-deep and universal themes. Blade Runner is a movie that challenges the viewer to ponder not only what it means to be human, but WHY we are human. Through the central characters of Deckard (the central male whom we know more about than he knows of himself), played by Harrison Ford, Rachael (the female replicant and love interest of Deckard's who is the most advanced of her kind but still knows only mortality), played by Sean Young, and Roy Batty (the revengeful replicant who wages war on both Deckard and his own maker), played by Rutger Hauer, Blade Runner is a timeless, universal and marvelous analysis and deconstruction of the human condition in all its dimensions. And the characterizations by Ford, Young and most notably Hauer all leave indelible impressions.Also broadening the narrative scope of the film is the mind-boggling fusion of postmodern cyberpunk and future neo-noir. This adds yet another layer of beauty and intrigue, especially in Vangelis' instantly recognizable score and with the cynical and introverted Deckard feeling much like a role Humphrey Bogart might have accepted.The second definitive sign of Blade Runner's colossal greatness lies in its cautionary tale view of the future \u2013 and in 2009, unlike 1982, we all know how alarming the possibility of it successfully predicting the future is. After all, 2019 is only 11 years away. Pollution, slavery, prostitution, global warming, corruption. Technological enslavement? Think about that the next time you buy a piece of audiovisual equipment or even the next time you fire up your computer. Good sci-fi always tries to predict the future. Only the very best get it right.In summary, you can throw 2001: A Space Odyssey or Metropolis or even The Matrix at me, but in my book, with its ageless eye-candy, its questions about life and human nature, and its gritty yet all-too-possible prediction of the future, Blade Runner is the definitive science-fiction movie of all time.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "The best sci-fi movie ever made?

The ultimate question is whether Ridley Scott's perfect vision is any good. I can emphatically say it has earned itself a place on the podium of the most extraordinary films ever.Set in a dystopian and perpetually raining Los Angeles during 2019, the story begins when five replicants escape onto the streets. Replicants are terrifying androids that are visually identical and superior to humans in every way. However, they do have a life span of four years and possess no memory, features which distinguish them from the genuine article. We then discover the lonely main protagonist of the story named Deckard, played convincingly by Harrison Ford, whose job is to eliminate these replicants.From here a dense noir thriller quickly evolves, fizzling from one visually stunning element to another. However, the best ingredient of this science fiction film is its wariness of not being too tedious by stuffing itself with sci-fi gibberish. Instead, it concentrates on absorbing themes, such as the question of identity or the value of being human. In spite of this, the thing that truly makes it a cult classic is the characters and environment, which are richly detailed and compelling.To everyone reading this, I leave you with one of the films marvellous quotations; 'I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.'", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Intruigingly detailed, tense, a great landmark in sci-fi thriller history", "date": "2008-09-14T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1945898"}, {"content": "i just watched this one again recently ... it's magnificent! the mood in this movie, the questions it asks ... very few movies manage to do this the cast is great, especially Rutger Hauer, but they are all very good really the special effects are well done and do not feel boring even today the pictures it shows are dark and beautiful the story it tells should be heard by everyone if you expect a matrix-style action you would be disappointed - this one is more about thinking and feeling than about karate --- Roy Batty: \"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.

Blade Runner, directed by Ridley Scott, focuses on a stylized, retro-future Los Angeles where everything is not well. This film presents a dramatic landscape of the future with no certain explication on how we got to this point. All that is explained is that human replicants have been born from immense breakthroughs in technology, and that other than their increased strength and intelligence, are indistinguishable from their human counterparts. Rick Deckard, played by Harrison Ford, is a retired member of an elite squad known as Blade Runners, whose purpose is to hunt down rogue replicants and destroy them. And such is the scenario that Scott presents us with as he takes us on a journey to the very core of meaning and existence.The film's breathtaking imagery and its incredible sound bolster this raw journey as Deckard reluctantly hunts down a group of replicants. We are placed in the context of this world, less knowledgeable than the fictional characters, and we are not pushed to believe that one side is more righteous or more deserving of life. Deckard's pursuit of the wanted replicants takes us through a character study or character studies of not just Deckard but the replicants too, mainly the leader, Roy Batty played by Rutger Hauer. The performances are outstanding by a great cast, additionally including the likes of Sean Young, Daryl Hannah and Edward Olmos. Through the blend of these great performances, we see these characters for what they are and how they truly exist, be they human or replicant. There are a few twists along the way that I do not want to spoil but the film slowly builds to a haunting and powerful climax.And that is an important part of the experience of viewing Blade Runner: that it is slow. By no means is this an action-packed film like a, shall we say, Terminator: Judgment Day. But this film is so strong and smart in what it presents that the pace of the film is not only unnoticeable but incredibly artistic. And it separates itself from the rest of the sci-fi pack with its phenomenal aesthetic artistry. The retro-future noir style of Los Angeles is captured beautifully and lends greater credibility to the plot and the characters. Through the dark and noir setting, we are given a bleak glimpse into the future, that seems rather plausible and palpable even in our present day.Let me be honest as I conclude here. When I first saw this film, I didn't really enjoy it. I didn't appreciate it that much and I was left rather disappointed. However, upon my repeated viewings, this film continued to grow on me and presented me with new challenges and questions each time. And that is part of the magic of the enigmatic Blade Runner. It can show us something different every time without us truly understanding it every time. With that said, it has now become one of my favorite films of all time.

The film is successful in its handling of the loaded subject of artificial life, introducing new ideas of false memories and a unique vision of a dystopian future. The core build up is well crafted, performed and shot, however it loses momentum towards the end, causing me to question the films central achievements and consistency.Blade Runner follows Rick Deckard, an archetypal retired cop coerced into one final job to catch and kill 4 rogue Replicants (Robots forced to do slave labour for humans). The film plays with crime, sci-fi and noir themes, distorting our expectations and forming a unique twist on the conventions found in each genre.Running through the film are motifs of eyes and Christian symbolism, the former including the intense Voight-Kampff test scene and the above eye shot with the industrialised, dystopian L.A sprawling ahead. The Christian symbolism is a questionable inclusion in a film with no major connection with religion, one flawed example being Roy Batty's hand pierced by a nail during his pursuit of Deckard. Likening Batty to Jesus doesn't fit with his violent, calculating personality shown through the film. The subtext here seems to have been added as an afterthought, it's too sloppy to relate to any ideas the film has already established, and too major a comparison to introduce at such a late stage.The film is infamous for its long-running debate about whether or not Deckard is a replicant. Both sides have their merits, Deckard being a replicant would lend to the ideas concerning artificial life and the existence of an objective reality, however it would detract from the complex history and social conditions surrounding replicants the film presents - it would be very unlikely that a replicant would be put in a position of power such as a blade runner, even for experimental purposes. This final mystery disregards the emotional crux of the film, both humans and replicants are shown to be emotionally equal, showing balanced levels of thought and feeling. Deckard potentially being one is almost irrelevant to his character, disregarding the obvious irony of him hunting his own kind and not knowing it. The ambiguity revealed in the final moments distracts from the poetic image of a man and replicant in love, fleeing society and breaking all the rules as they go.Roy Batty's death speech is the highpoint of the film script-wise; his sudden jolt of heroics is shocking and performed well by Rutger Hauer, who makes the insane robot's bout of divine understanding believable and compelling. However when considering the relationship between Batty and Deckard, Deckard having killed Batty's replicant girlfriend Pris, Batty minutes before breaking Deckard's fingers, and the blade runner's numerous attempts to kill him, his final act of kindness seems like a well concealed deus-ex-machina. One argument could be Batty accepts his fate in his dying moments, no longer having a reason to kill Deckard. But earlier Batty finds out he has no chance of life, yet still mercilessly kills J.F Sebastian - despite well deserving of its iconic status, the rooftop sequence doesn't hold up to scrutiny.The set design and lighting (or lack of) compliments the narratives stylistic twists, the people in their flying cars don't enjoy a luxurious future of economic stability and urban technological perfection, instead spluttering through darkness, drowning in noirish smoke and patronising talking advertisements. J.F Sebastian's decrepit, rainwater filled home is an excellent manifestation of the state of Earth in the future.

Blade Runner is a great example of how a sci-fi film and despotic vision of the future should be made. It also shows how good a director Ridley Scott is and is Harrison Ford's best performance as an actor (but I do like him in Indiana Jones and Star Wars).The film is set in Los Andreas in 2019, 37 years into the future when the film was made. Humans had started to colonise space and use clones (called replicants) as slave labour. After a revolution replicants are banned on Earth and are hunted down by Blade Runners if any make to the planet. Harrison Ford plays Rick Deckard, a top blade runner who had gone into retirement. Five special replicants make it to Los Andreas, all breed to be super strong and able to fight. Deckard is asked by the company who made them to hunt them down. This is a tough task for the blade runner which rises questions within him about whether he is doing the right thing and asks ideas about humanity.What Blade Runner does is asked a lot of questions to the audience and makes them thing. It is a complex film in that way. It varies from issues of cloning and slavery to issues of environmentalism and over-population. It also shows ideas like two different classes being formed, an rich-upper class and a poor-lower class, possibly influenced by Marxist ideology and other sci-fi and despotic cultural items like 1984, A Clockwork Orange and Metropolis. The film also looks at the character of Deckard as he starts to doubt the task he is doing. A big debate within the fans of Blade Runner is where Deckard is a human or a replicant. I personally favour he is a human, but that is just my interpretation of it. The film is also influenced by film noir and has been called future-noir. It does have that feel to it and is a little like a detective story, showing Deckard's investigation. The music is also fitting for the film, similar to the music to film noir films. The music also reminds me of the first Championship Manager game, which is downloadable from the SI games website (the makes of the Championship Manager and later Football Manager games).Blade Runner was based on a Philip K. Dick novel, 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?'. Philip K. Dick is considered to be a brilliant sci-fi writer, I have only read one of his books, the Man in the High Castle, which was pretty good. His ideas have been converted to films. Some have been very good like Total Recall and Minority Report, but also some bad ones like Next and Paycheck. Blade Runner is easily the best film based on a Philip K. Dick idea.

It has for good reasons remained one of the most cited examples for critics. Most of all, Blade Runner is the visually most captivating Sci-Fi movie of all times. Its' dark, haunting vision of an apocalyptic post industrial world can even today easily compete with special effect loaded CGI movies. The rich, sinister pictures wrapped in lurid neon light create an atmosphere which pulls you deeper and deeper into the melancholic, monstrous world of Blade Runner. The music, the pictures and the deeply symbolic story create an unmatched, intense atmosphere, that has inspired countless other movies and generations of directors.The rich story touches not only some of the deepest of human emotions, fears and hopes alike, but raises plenty of philosophical questions concerning the strive for an identity and moral integrity - and the sense in any life that is delivered to death. Roy Batty's quest for survival throws his counterpart, Rick Deckard back to a haunting uncertainty in every single of the concepts of his life: He has to face the insane amorality of his life in an amoral world, has to question the fundamentals of his identity as a human being and finally faces the tragedy of death by gaining a deep insight into Roy Betty's world just at the moment of its' demise. In the last moments of his existence, Roy takes a deep look at his shining but all to brief lifetime and finally comes to see: \"All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in the rain.\" The way how Deckard lives through this fundamental, existentialistic crisis could easily be compared to Beckett's \"Godot\" or Camus' \"Sisyphus\". And just like these characters, the story refuses to give an answer or non-ambiguous solution. It leaves you with questions to think about for a lifetime.A haunting and dark, but highly rewarding journey into a fictional world, with all too real references, that is not easily swallowed or digested. But if you should try to do so, you will be working on tightening the fundamentals of your life - or just enjoy a unique trip through the corners of your mind.

Ridley Scott's dystopian view of the future of LA is haunting and visually beautiful. The ruthless, capitalist world is frighteningly feasible. The grim future our world has is brought to reality in this original masterwork by a fantastic director.The story entails that humans built artificial robot like creatures called replicants which are full blown clones of humans!. The catch is though that they can only live for four years. These replicants have about as much intelligence as their creators. These replicants become out of control and in turn forbidden from earth and forced to work as slaves. To make sure that these replicants stay off earth, Blade Runners are hired. This enchanting story really reveals how the world is leading to self destruction and we are really getting too intelligent for our own good!. Playing God will never work.Harrison Ford plays a Bladerunner who has to eliminate four replicants that hijacked a space ship and got back to earth. His performance was brilliant, as we would expect from Ford. During his journey he meets a female who doesn't seem to know shes a replicant, this develops into a rather confusing romance story. A replicant and a human in love?Throughout the film there are bizarre melds of chilling music. Piercing cat howlings are used throughout the film especially in the final showdown between Deckard (Ford) and Roy. This showdown is one of the most intriguing showdowns in cinema. Why is Deckard so scared of Roy?, why do they relate to each other so much? This is a relatively brief film and while I would have preferred it to be longer, it did leave me somewhat awe-strucked by the cliffhanger ending. Im a great fan of films that provide more questions than answers after all, a film that makes you think is better than any other film.Perhaps Deckard is a replicant himself?

Truly, I wasn't boasting with my assertion that I've seen this movie as much as I have (I watch this movie almost once a week and have done so for almost 10 years). I own several, still unopened, VHS tapes that for a large part of the nineties I did my best at collecting. I own the Japanese Laserdisc version, a rare bootleg VHS version that was distributed over the internet a handful of years ago that has the narration selectively placed back into the Director's Cut version of the film, not called the Esper Version as some would want to label it, the Director's Cut and now the HD version of the Final Cut. That makes 5, but 6 if you count the Workprint version that comes with this box set. So, I would say that's one more than most.Blade Runner first and foremost, is probably the greatest film ever made, from beginning to end and in all of its variations. A bold statement when the film doesn't even rank in the top 10 in the American Film Institute or on IMDb. Spots #97 and #104 respectively (ahem). But as these kind of lists are subjective and truly under the control of mere mortals and their own strange whims, and I take no offense that so many so-called aficionados have over-looked this film for so long. Roger Ebert slammed Ridley Scott and the film during the first theatrical release by stating that 'Scott cared more about the lush environment of the film than he did of the story', which as we all know - and even Ebert now, in hindsight, has stated that he was unkind and grossly unfair to both Scott and the film.For years, Blade Runner was divided into two different camps, or rather four and they are: Those that preferred the narration and those that did not and the other camp was those that thought Deckard was a Replicant and those that thought he was either human or felt it was left ambiguous. Ridley Scott has very gracefully over the years, given homage to these thoughts and made many statements that most readers are aware of, chiefly - that Deckard was a Replicant. Unfortunately, due to the studios fingering with the film during post-production, Warner Brothers had the right to trim anything after the 120 min mark, and thus butchering the nuance of the film and leaving several things vague and forcing Scott to tack on the Happy ending and the narration - because as we all know ... we're all just too stupid to get it.The new and most refreshing part of the new argument, evinced in the 210 (wow!) min documentary 'Dangerous Days' is that Scott gives equal time to those that enjoyed the film with the narration, with Guillermo del Toro (Pan's Labyrinth / Hellboy) in the forefront, with his very candid telling of how Blade Runner changed his life and launched him down the road into film-making. We also get to hear a very lucid and warm retelling from Harrison Ford of the nightmare that he not only endured making the movie but the further commitment of having to do the Voice Over narration months later, which ended up having its own strange story as well.So, now with 5 versions available in this box set, you get to see Blade Runner in every single angle imaginable and it is engrossing every time. Ebert also said in the Nineties that the re-release of the movie for the Director's Cut gives you yet another version of the film, but fails to handle the main problems that were so apparent the first time around. As the film has changed Ebert has gone from student flippancy to utmost respect and enjoyment. Ebert's own site has all three versions of his reviews which are interesting to read in context to the passage of time if you're interested.There are so many layers to Blade Runner and so many things that can be said from the brilliant look of the newly restored cut, the awesome remixed sound, the Original Score by Vangelis, and the story itself. Blade Runner is probably the high water mark of all films and will probably stay that way for quite some time. Internet voting puts the film as the 4th greatest movie of all time, according to AFI's own user polls - so that really puts perspective on AFI's and IMDb's so-called Final Lists.On a final note, when people watch this film, a lot of people come away with a strange feeling of familiarity regarding the content, the story and the character of Rick Deckard the protagonist, the Detective, the Blade Runner. You should know that Philip K. Dick was an incredibly huge fan of Raymond Chandler and absorbed every one of his stories on a personal level. Hampton Fancher, the screenwriter was privy to this when he penned the screenplay while making the adaptation for 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' and did his best to not only pay homage to this for Dick but for Chandler as well. Movies like 'The Big Sleep' really bring it home and make it evident to the viewer. The novel almost reads like the narration and in latter years I find impossible to not hear Harrison Ford's voice as I read 'The Big Sleep'.\"What do you think of my Owl, Mr. Deckard?\" \"Is it real?\"", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 7, "votes": 14}, "heading": "More Human than Human ... that's Our Motto ...", "date": "2008-05-15T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1874383"}, {"content": "There are no words to describe what i feel about this film, so i will describe in sentences.When i first watched this movie i didn't even finish, this i don't blame on myself, i blame this on the *beep* PREVIEWS!!!

This film is pure Triple Gold, Double Hit, Multi-Platinum...everything. The special effects were unbelievable, in the sense that they were unbelievably believable to what it would really be like in the future.This story also includes many warnings, such as \"stop smoking\", \"stop littering\" and \"stop polluting\". It sends a warning and shows an example of what we could look forward to if we do keep doing these things.This movie hides many different messages, stories and moral teachings on many different levels. It contains a love story and a story of trying to answer those unanswered questions -- why am i here? how long have i got? What Philip K. Dick has created, and what Ridley Scott has recreated, is absolutely beautiful. I am glad Ridley Scott went ahead to make a Final Cut of the film. We needed re-mastered visual footage to go along with the strength of the story, we also needed to never hear that annoying Harrison Ford voice-over ever again! For me, personally, it ruined the entire film for me. Wherever there was a scene containing the film's signature dramatic tension, supported by Vangelis, there popped in the crappy macho-voiced voice-over. Note: I watched the theatrical (voice-over version) after watching the final cut for the second time, which i though was the greatest film of all time. I turned off the movie and had to watch the final cut again to redeem myself of the voice-over garbage at the end of the film when Roy Batty's life-span is up and he lets go of the dove in rain which flew over in clear weather (which i actually thought was a beautiful feature) after his famous quote: \"All Those Moments Will Be Lost In Time...Like Tears In Rain\", and then dies. This was ruined by the macho voice-over crap that popped in from Harrison Ford to tell us the obvious of how come Batty let him live.Anyway, please, if you have watched in once and didn't care for it, watch it again (Final Cut version) and even more times if you have to.

Perhaps I too will be editing my comment after viewing it again.On the technical side, it looks amazing. The dark dazzling world is eerily real. It also reminds one of noir classics. It does not have the stop motion that CGI's of today's movies have. I loved the technology that was used in 80's movies like 'Blade Runner', 'Starwars', 'The Dark Crystal' and 'Labyrinth'. They made their worlds more real to me. And when I revisit those movies today, it brings a nostalgic feeling as I remember how much I enjoyed these films. In the more recent movies, it's quite easy to tell which scenes were done with CGI as there is a lack of authentic look about it. Back to 'Blade Runner', the special effects and cinematography are mindblowing and how can anyone overlook Vangelis's powerful score? And what makes us appreciate them more is that none of them are over-the-top to the extent that they compromise the story.I haven't seen all of Ridley Scott's film but so far I'd say 'Blade Runner' is his best. His direction is solid. This wasn't an easy film to make and Scott deserves all the credit he's gotten. The cast is also interesting as it includes (then) not-so-famous actors. Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos and Daryl Hannah all fit the bill.Today if one looks at these new science fiction wannabe movies, there's a sadness about how science fiction has progressed in Hollywood.

That is the same reason replicants are outlawed in Eareth, but some of them may try to come here. That's where the BR unit comes in. So four of them are out there, trying get to their maker, Tyrell (Joe Turkel). And here's the cue for Deckard, in pursuit of those four, before they manage to do any bigger damage.The first thing that jumps out is, that despite being over 20 years old, Blade Runner still has stunning visual effects, that show no sign of aging. We see views of Los Angeles, with sky scraping towers of concrete and steel, pushing out gas explosions. The humongous splendor and size of Tyrell corp, which we then can compare against crowded streets, lit with endless rows of neon signs. The city is as important character than anyone else in the movie. Upon that visual splendor is the soundtrack done by Vangelis. A soundtrack, that set the mood perfectly, along with the sound effects.But even the greatest effects are nothing without a good cast, and that is something Blade Runner has. Rutger Hauer does a great job as Roy, the leader of the renegade replicants. He' accompanied by Daryl Hannah (Pris), Brion James (Leon) and Joanna Cassidy (Zhora). Out of the replicants Zhora is left for least of the attention. On the opposing side there's Gaff (Edward James Olmos), an eccentric detective and perhaps one of the most memorable characters in the story, thanks to Olmos's dedication to the job, and Bryant (M.

Especially when the sci-fi leads you to expect action, it can get really slow. It's the images and the use of darkness and light that make this film good and interesting. While confusing, you start to get the film towards the end.While not Ford's best role because it doesn't call on him to do much, he still continues to be the best protagonist to get his butt handed to him in every film.

An action film simply wouldn't do that. Once again, the sci-fi is simply to establish and set the tone for future L.A., it is not an integral part of the film.

While all three could be in the future, it isn't very likely right now. And the worst part is, the weapons aren't even as cool as Star Wars.Ford falls for an android, but a special one. Will he have android future? Possible. But I know that those children will probably want a career. And I don't think that is worth it.Overall, this movie is sub par. It has descent content, but its long, lacks action, and the story is flat. Just not enough to keep me interested. Harrison Ford has done much better work in his life.

I believe wholeheartedly that It's just the most extraordinary and influential film i've ever seen. the most strange thing about this film is that it doesn't really state who's good and who's bad.The film is directed in 1982 by my favourite director Ridley Scott & it's about future life. it's not innovative, but it's just shocking. The action takes place in LA , in November( my sweet month=/ ) and the main point is humanity VS non-humanity. it's about poor replicantsThe replicants are artificial humans, indistinguishable from the real thing in every way but two: they have no memories, and they have lifespans of only four years. at the beginning i thought that they had no sense too, but i was absolutely wrong.. they have sense, therefore they have wishes, and only wish they have is right to live more than their limited life gives them chance.Deckard is the main character. he is a retired Blade Runner, but then he's forced back from retirement and it's his job to terminate them.I like Sean Young too much, she plays Rachel, Tyrell's assistant. As Tyrell says \"Rachael is an experiment. Nothing more\". She is \"New addition\" with faked memories, that are not her own, but she believes she is human, before she discovers what she really is. She has high intellect , I do LoVE her quote: >>>>>>>I'm not in the business. I am the business<<<<<<<<Blade Runner is not a popular film indeed. the person who recommended me to see it was my old friend:), a long-time fan of the movie Blade Runner and now we still have discussions about this film, because the questions are never ending. that's why I adore that film.In my opinion the main task of this film is to think and realize what is real life. Definitely, the movie leaves us asking those most difficult & philosophical questions, \"what is reality\", \"what is my aim\", \"What does it mean to be human\" and \"Who am I\".and the last words are cool indeed: - Its too bad she won't live. But then again who does? - the words which makes a person think about just LIFE!!!you know after watching the movie over 4 r 5 times. i realized that Deckard is a human !!!!!!!!! & if u agreed my summary( HUMANITY VS NON0HUMANITY) u'll have to agree with my statement.. as simple as that. another reason why i strongly believe that he is a human is MEMORY..As Rachael is an experiment, Deckard, and possibly other blade runners as well, cannot be biorobotic being with false memories. Deckard cannot be a veteran blade runner, if he is a replicant and also cant believe it! he couldn't have procedual memory cause even Rachel( new edition and experiment wit memory as Tyrell says) doesn't have it. I'm studying phsicology so i see difference between declarative and procedural memory.. Rachel had only declarative memory(because it was impossible to put in her mind procedural memory without any past life and any experience) but Deckard had both.. why?? cause he's a HUMAN!!! To sum up my wiew Rick is 3D person and others(no matter repl or human) are 2dFinally, i wanna say it is up to the viewer to decide whether Deckard is a biorobotic being or an human... thank u 4 attention.MAGDA STRONFELL", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": ">>>>>>blaDeRuNNeR<<<<<<< humanity VS non-humanity", "date": "2008-04-09T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1854606"}, {"content": "Blade-Runner will disappoint you on the first viewing - guaranteed. However; film enthusiasts will feel compelled to watch the film once more - and there-in lies the hook.You will feel disappointed with the first viewing mainly because: At first; the plot doesn't make any sense, what-so-ever The characters will seem pretty much two-dimensionalFor a two hour film you'll have felt like you have watched paint dryIn fact the only thing that will stay with you, during that first viewing; is the incredible Vangellis soundtrack and perhaps some interesting visuals.You will come back to watch again purely because of the concept, some sequences that you thought were the film's \"Saving Grace\" and how (if you took the reins) you would have made \"Blade-Runner\" better, if it was your film.There is an issue with Pacing. The Villain (Roy Batty) isn't even shown in action or given diolog until halfway into the film, and by then you have already gotten bored of Deckard. This pacing continues, causing the ending to be abrupt and makes the audience unappreciative of Roy's goodbye speech. But you find yourself used to this after more viewings. The pacing isn't remotely formula which does spoil the first impression I must admit. But pretty soon you'll find that the he movie is entirely watchable. No; Blade-Runner is not a \"classic's classic\", but there will be parts in the film that you will prefer more than most. This depending on the style of film-making you relate to or brought up with etc. In fact you will find yourself watching \"Blade-Runner\" only for certain sequences that you like in the film.Blade-Runner could have been a true classic - but in the end, it is a film that isn't entirely balanced. A film that is soft of hanging 'in limbo' - and this is why you'll find \"Blade-Runner\" fascinating and timeless. The concept. The concept is so well done for a movie, made when it was. However if \"Blade-Runner\" was remade today, it would be considered too much of a clich\u00e9. This is what also keeps \"Blade-Runner\" top-dog; nobody can to copy it and get away with it. Kind of sad really - they take all the good ideas and wasted them in a \"flop-could-have-been classic\"But having said that; \"Blade-Runner\" is not a satisfying enough picture, on that first viewing.

Sure the film's pretty sets and tale of robots have inspired many low grade science fiction movies but without the conflicted hero the movie would have no purpose and no real anchor to drive home the film's message. Indeed the hero essayed by Harrison Ford is why I give this 4 stars, his burned out hero sharply contrasts the lights and atmosphere of the film. Without the hero's dim perception of his home this film would be just a work in special effects. That this contrast is made, as well as the hero's indifference to the life he lives compared to the replicants he hunts is what makes the movie the classic it is.

He is also the most powerful and most deadly of them all. Roy's death, which shows him to have leaped beyond humanity to something above, is portrayed as a redeeming sacrifice, which liberates Deckard. Roy pours out the last remaining seconds of the life he loves so much in an act of pure forgiveness, going so far as to save his persecutor from certain death. Deckard can no longer do his job; more importantly, he no longer needs to fear or doubt his feelings for the android Rachel, or worry that she isn't really human: in the ways that really matter, in compassion and self-giving, Roy has shown him that the androids have surpassed their makers.A very powerful and moving film.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 4}, "heading": "Ridley Scott's finest - a story of humanity", "date": "2008-02-24T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1826249"}, {"content": "Legendary writer Philip K Dick wrote the classic novel Do Andriods Dream of Electric Sheep?

Deckard is asked to become a Blade Runner again and find these Replicants then Retire them, in the future the world has two types of people, humans and Replicants. A Replicant is a copy of a human and has a four year life span which was created as a fail safe device if ever they tried to rebel against humans, a Blade Runner is a cop who hunts Replicants that's gone rebellious and then Retire them. This Replicant group is lead by a Replicant named Roy Batty are trying to find away to prolong there life before it runs out and will stop at nothing until the get it. Deckard meets a female Replicant named Rachael who starts to help him on his case, meanwhile one of the Replicants befriends a man who helped create them and try and use him meet the creator of the Replicants to find out how to make themselves live longer before there life span is over meanwhile Deckard starts to get closer to Retiring the group of Replicants but Roy Batty won't give up without a fight and Deckard may be facing his most dangerous Replicant.

Watched all four versions pretty much back to back (minus the work print version) starting with the US theatrical and finishing with the Final Cut. And across those eight hours I spent with the film, I did not get tired of watching \u2013 just watching \u2013 that futuristic film-noir vibe: deep dark shadows and majestic use of light and color used to make a run-down polluted cityscape look so beautiful. In fact, when I got to the Final Cut, which had been cleaned up, restored, and remixed, the picture and sound quite literally took my breath away.Blade Runner is easily one of the best looking films ever made.In some ways, many ways, Blade Runner strikes me as silly. Particularly in its more climactic moments where the protagonist faces off against a replicant. Pris's acrobatic means of attacking Deckard? When Roy Batty chases Deckard in his shorts (when a few moments before he was fully clothed?) The film goes over-the-top to the point where I find myself asking, \"why in the world would the characters do that?!\" But here's what's interesting: as silly as Blade Runner may get it never betrays its own world. Everything that happens, in some queer way, feels natural to this strange futuristic world.I like the movie in its action scenes, but I simply adore it during the quieter moments \u2013 the parts where not a whole hell of a lot is happening, and you can simply watch and absorb Jordan Cronenweth's marvelous cinematography. My favorite scene comes when Rachel has saved Deckard's life. An emotional wreck of killing another replicant on top of the revelation that she, herself, is a replicant \u2013 she stands by a window where light floods in, so much light that the whole screen goes white, and then it recedes again and we see the characters again. Later in that same scene, she sits at the piano, plays for a bit, and then lets her hair down. Hearing Deckard stumbling in the other room, she looks out of the corner of her eye \u0085 and shot after shot after shot through this entire sequence demonstrates absolute mastery over the frame.Plus some of the other quiet moments resonate with a truer low-key science-fiction feel such as the scene in Tyrell corporation where Deckard applies the Voight-Kampff test to Rachel. More or less a mundane questionaire/interview with a typical sci-fi gadget sitting on the table, but Ridley Scott and Terry Rawlings compacts the lengthy endeavor into a few short moments using a stunningly simple montage.Later on, Deckard sits in front of a voice-activated screen analyzing a photograph. The task is presented as a dull monotonous job (made especially evident in Harrison Ford's delivery), yet the scene, itself, never bores. The voice-activation not only serves as a staple sci-fi device, but cleverly allows Deckard to take the audience's hand and guide them through this investigative process. And perhaps what I like most about the scene: the audience, and even Deckard himself, doesn't even really know what he's found. Things don't magically fall into place with a Scooby-Doo moment of revelation. He finds another clue that might lead somewhere (albeit, since it's a movie it's a good guess the clue does lead somewhere.) In my mind at least moments such as the Voight-Kampff scenes, Deckard's briefing, the photograph analysis, both of Rachel's scenes in Deckard's apartment gives the world of Blade Runner a solid grounding so later on it can get away with the absurd.Which brings me to the replicants. Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) in particular, whose strangely sympathetic in that his murderous tendencies spawn directly from his fear of dying. This is a man who possesses a strong conviction that he deserves life perhaps because he looks around on earth and sees people squandering their existence while he knows he only has a few short moments. Why should a shmuck like Deckard live for 50+ years when Roy in his 4 short years has seen attack ships burning off the shoulder of Orion and seen C-beams glitter in the dark \u0085 \"If only you could see what I've seen with your eyes,\" he proudly and warmly tells one of the scientists who helped create him.As for which cut of the film, I don't think any single one is perfect (and I'd honestly watch any of them in a heartbeat.) I prefer the \"Final Cut\" over the others and admire Ridley Scott's restraint in his definitive DVD release. Most of the modifications are fine-tuning tweaks the casual viewer won't even notice unless watching two version back to back, and most of said fine-tuning improve the film (although, admittingly, Roy's beckoning of Sebastian could've been left out.) But hell, all versions of Blade Runner are included, so people don't have much room to complain about the changes.

I mean, sure it looked great, but the supposedly deep story just didn't grab me. Then I got the five disc briefcase for Christmas and immediately put in the Final Cut. Wow. It's all clear now.Blade Runner is one of a precious few pantheon of science fiction film that has become even more prescient as time passes (the other that comes to mind is 2001: A Space Odyssey). Look at the L.A. in this film, then look at present-day Los Angeles. Subtract the flying cars and robots and you've got the same city (horribly polluted and overpopulated with many ethnicities mixing language and cultures). We follow Deckard, a specialized cop known as a Blade Runner who hunts down androids known as replicants. These machines look like humans and, if given time to mature, emote like humans. They are used as labor and sex slaves, but die out after a 4 year period so their emotions do not develop (this too has ties to the modern world. Planned obsolescence is the reason your electronics never last more than a year or two). When a replicant starts to piece things together before it dies, Deckard must take it out before it harms humans.As the film progresses, we can see that Deckard doesn't particularly like his job despite the fact that he is the best Blade Runner in town. The replicant Rachael (played by Sean Young) seems to trigger a re-evaluation of his life, and he takes no pleasure in hunting the group of dangerous androids he's been hired to \"retire\".This film is Sir Ridley Scott's masterpiece, and the one that best shows his talents. Like his idol Kubrick, Scott knows how to light a scene just the right way, and his use of smoke and blinds and fans and anything else that distorts light is what gives the film its noir feel. He drops clues all along the way to that paramount of questions: Is Deckard a replicant? Every clue can be construed to fit either side of the debate, and it proves that there is no wrong answer to the question.The Final Cut essentially omits and touches up more than it adds. Most \"director's cuts\" are excuses to throw in material that was cut for a reason (and a good deal of them are done without the director's consent). Here, Scott digitally touches up a few technical flaws, but he doesn't go crazy like Lucas. Also, we get the complete unicorn scene, which is crucial to the film's big question, as well as sticking with the DC's omitted voice-over narration (which is such a blessing, by the way).In the end Blade Runner is a masterful look at that which makes us human. Roy Batty's final act gives us all the insight into replicants we need and his final speech is perhaps the single most moving moment in science fiction. It serves to underscore the whole film, and it sends chills down my spine every time I see it. Blade Runner is one of those precious sci-fi films that actually challenges you to think, and it almost single-handedly founded the film genre of cyberpunk, which had been present in literature but hadn't crossed over. Cyberpunk is unquestionably the most thought-provoking sub-genre of science fiction, and this film is its masterpiece.

Obviously it's affected a lot of people, because of all the comments here. I saw this movie when it first came out, then I saw it again when they thankfully removed Harrison Ford's voiceovers from it (which he himself didn't think was appropriate for the film.) This film has apparently been re-edited several times, but no matter how many times they do, it will never be completely satisfying. What it needed was one more rewrite at the beginning, with development of one tiny element: the characters. We don't care about the replicants enough; because we don't know enough about them. We don't care about Harrison Ford's character enough, because he kills too soullessly, \"just doing his job\", and doesn't give it a second thought. Which brings me to the movie's biggest deficit: He has no character arc. He doesn't grow or change throughout the movie. Phillip K. Dick mentioned in a rare interview I'm glad I got to read, that he intended the replicants and the character of Deckard to undergo a reversal: the replicants become more human, with a conscience, by the end of the film, and Deckard becomes less and less human because of his actions, until their characters have completely switched. This would have given a satisfying and complete meaning to the film. All the replicants wanted to do was live, not be slaves and to be left alone for the remainder of their brief lives. All Deckard wanted to do was kill them, get paid and go home. No thought given to his actions afterwards. We learn nothing of the replicants' inner feelings except the main one, and then only peripherally. If they had been allowed to emote and to feel pain, we would have empathized with them and had a problem with Deckard killing them. So there really is no-one to empathize with, certainly not Ford, who plays a futuristic Charles Bronson character out of Deathwish, who killed muggers and punks with no emotion whatsoever. Possible Spoiler: One major quibble I have is with the murder of Sebastian, the one (and only) empathetic character out of the whole film. He acts as the unwilling host for two of the replicants, he comes to like them and they seem to like him, but after the head replicant kills Tyrell, the genius who bioengineered the replicants, he goes after Sebastian, and we hear later that the replicant killed him too. Why? This completely undermines the evolution of the replicant towards humanity. We can see why the replicant would kill his creator who created him to be a disposable slave who will die after four years, but a man who had helped him? It was a senseless contradiction and brought us back to square one about caring about the replicants. (Even with Darth Vader, the audience empathized with him a little, being scarred up and a victim of his destiny. He didn't just kill people randomly.) So, there we have it. The reason why, in my opinion, the movie will never be as great as it could be, because nothing changes, and we have no-one (and nothing) to really care about. At the end we're left with a film that creates a sense of mood, and not a moral or meaningful statement. That's too bad; it could have done all of that, with one more rewrite and ten minutes more of developing (i.e., evolving) the characters. Rutger Hauer's \"tears in the rain\" speech at the end unfortunately is not enough to accomplish that by itself. However, I doubt that Ridley Scott cares about any of that, as he endlessly re-edits the visuals in his film......", "rating": 6, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 8}, "heading": "The Best of the Almost Great Movies", "date": "2008-01-15T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1800461"}, {"content": "I hadn't seen Blade Runner for quite a while, so after getting my sweaty hands on the new 5 disc final cut special edition box-set, I had to watch what director Ridley Scott sees as the definitive version of the film.First of all this film is over 25 years old, it came out the year after I was born. What is most striking to me is the fact this films aged so well, this is in some parts down to the 'final cuts' visual tweaks, but it's also thanks to the way the film is shot. The futuristic elements in Blade Runner never becomes the main showcase of the film, they're kept in the background or in the dark and you only ever see a glimpse of this and a glance of that. Unlike some sci-fi films that show everything clear as day all the time, to get the 'AAAH' factor and then a few years down the line they look dated. The atmosphere sets the mood and feel of the film, it's dark and gloomy, forever raining, with glints of light and an urban Japanese look. It's a believable future and it doesn't seem so far away. The story follows Deckard (Harrison Ford) who is the Blade Runner of the title, a cop who specialises in retiring (terminating) replicants, human clones now deemed dangerous and declared illegal. His expertise are needed when 6 replicants are loose on the streets after escaping from an off-world colony to Earth. There's a lot more to it, but I wont spoil anything. The story to me isn't the heart of the film anyway, it's about the desire to live, human emotions, philosophy and memories. The acting is kept mostly subtle, like Ridley's vision of the future they never really become powerhouse performances, but it's masterful subtlety. Then there's Rutger Hauer as the main replicant, the standout performance for me and it is easily his finest hour, he is remarkable here. Evidence that he had a great ability that's been shamefully overlooked somewhat in his career.Blade Runner is a timeless, incredible and hugely influential sci-fi classic.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "A timeless, incredible and hugely influential sci-fi classic.", "date": "2008-01-12T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1798619"}, {"content": "I was very young when I first saw Blade Runner in the theater. I thought it was basically a 1930's detective novel made in the future. However there is so many things written about it, including Ridley Scott's admission that Dekker (played by Harrison Ford) is in reality not a human but a replicant. Now I know there are a lot of \"clues\" that he is a replicant: The way his eyes glow, the subtle remarks that are made, the unicorn dream etc. etc. However there are some things that make me think he could be a human: the replicants all seem to have superior strength and stamina, Dekker seems like a normal human being. If he was as strong as the replicants, even if he was programmed to \"believe\" he was human, why didn't that superior strength come to play? It also seemed strange that the other replicants seemed to be unaware that Dekker was a \"brother\" replicant as well, and if they did, why didn't they try to win him over? Ahhh here's the rub, the Voit Kamp test is supposed to test a person's \"empathy\" the emotion that the replicant's lacked. Empathy is a person's capacity to feel another person's feelings as like your own. Dekker seems to me in the beginning to be a man who has grown cynical, but his hunt for the replicants brings these emotions back to him. He actually falls in LOVE with a replicant, he witnesses a replicant out to kill him us his last bit of strength to save his life. I think the idea of the story was that aside from the 4 year lifespan, the human condition of the future has actually dehumanized humans until they were really no better than the replicants they created. Yet through his hunt for them, Dekker actually gained back a humanity that he had previously lost. Did anyone ever consider that the movie loses its power if Dekker is a replicant? Is Dekker a replicant? To tell you the truth...I really don't know.

This is the most cohesive, well-paced, and entertaining cut of the film, by FAR. I really hope Ridley Scott doesn't go do another cut because this one is as much as can be done without altering the script or filming new scenes.Another point I was thinking about during the film is how much of a 'theater movie' this is. I have seen the film in two forms (director's/theatrical) a total of three times, and though I always thought it was a good film, I never quite saw what all the fuss was about. A good, solid science fiction film was what I saw each time, but I had what felt like an epiphany during this viewing. The film is easily one of THE MOST GORGEOUS things I've ever seen. Brilliantly shot by Jordan Cronenweth (and I definitely give Ridley Scott some credit for how good this looks), the film is astoundingly beautiful and effective on the big screen. When watching it one realizes that each shot was painstakingly thought out, but unlike some others I've seen, the film is so fluid that you can't stop to think about such matters.One of several flaws I still believe \"Blade Runner\" suffers from is Vangelis' then ultra-modern score, which by today's standards is so dated it's distracting. That's not to say the film isn't well-scored, but synthesizer scores always bug me because they're bound to sound dated, and this is coming from a guy who loves 80's electronic music (the good stuff, not MTV). Another distracting aspect of the score was the bizarre combination of East Asian, Indian, and Arabic music which felt completely out of place and often forced. Since I'm criticizing the movie in this paragraph I'll throw in my opinion that the script was unbalanced in points, though drastically improved over the original 'voiceover included' version. I felt that dialogue could get distractingly forced at times.Still, during this viewing of \"Blade Runner: The Final Cut[\" I noticed that the majority of criticism leveled at the film is a big load of rubbish. Technically speaking, there is basically nothing at all wrong with the film. Visual effects are excellent, photography and editing are accomplished, and the acting is phenomenal across the board, be it Ford, Hauer, Hannah, or Young, watching them was a pleasure.There is something the film communicates when seen on the big screen which is missing from home video viewings, and I'm not sure what it is. Is the film so visually dazzling that viewing it on a theater screen glosses over its numerous errors and some other minor flaws, or is it just that with Ridley Scott finally fully overseeing the final product the film has really improved as much as it did in my eyes? Whatever it was, \"Blade Runner: The Final Cut\" is an outstanding science fiction film, not without its flaws, but still one of the most effective films in the genre I've ever seen, and though it forsakes a lot of Phillip K. Dick's philosophical pondering to focus more on the pulp-ish if quite intelligent sci-fi/neo-noir aspect of \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\", the film stands so well on its own that I left the theater overwhelmed and feeling even a bit privileged to have had the chance to view this incredible film on the big screen and learn to appreciate it more.9/10", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 7, "votes": 16}, "heading": "Blade Runner: The Final Cut", "date": "2008-01-06T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1794991"}, {"content": "I saw Blade Runner on cable when it first came out.

If the filmmakers had set it in the year 2119- a simple fix by simply changing the opening title card, it would have been much more believable. Even now with the year 2019 only 11 years in the future the world of Blade Runner is at least 150-200 years in the future. Granted you could make the same argument for 2001 but that film was more accurate in that it showed a Pan Am shuttle(foreshadowing the space shuttle) and an orbital space station which is currently under construction(Albeit in a much simpler form).And there was nothing in that film which couldn't have existed if the Vietnam war had never happened. Blade Runner is simply not realistic given it's historical context. So while brilliant visually the film as science fiction doesn't work but as fantasy works very well.

I've also been reading the other reviews here. For me, my Blade Runner experience began in 1984 when, at the age of 12, my friends and I were allowed to watch this R rated film by our parents. At 12 it resonated with me, particularly the philosophical aspects of the story, namely that all life is just fleeting like tears in the rain. The film instantly became one of my many favorites, but not the only favorite.As I've talked to more and more people over the years about films I find I am now in the minority when it comes to appreciating Blade Runner. I admit, and will not argue that, the film is slow paced. In fact, I'm not surprised that the slow pacing turns many people off, especially nowadays when everything has to be edit, edit, edit. As for the screenplay having inconsistencies and being too thin--well it just might. I guess what I experience when watching Blade Runner is a unique vision--Ridley Scott's vision--of a possible future where like Mary Shelley's \"Frankenstein\", man has created androids in their own image, but they aren't happy. In fact, they are both angry and depressed that there's no purpose to life, that they have no control over when they will die and that the person who made them can't fix any of their problems.So, I disagree with reviewers that say Blade Runner offers nothing to chew on or think about afterward. Yet, my wife completely didn't get Blade Runner. She just saw it as long, boring and confusing. Her perception focused on how Deckard's character is weakly written. How Harrison Ford did a poor job of acting along with Sean Young, Daryl Hannah and several others with the exception of Rutger Hauer who she felt did an excellent job of playing his role. She didn't like Vangelis's musical score and found it completely dated and inextricably tied to the 1980's. There is discord in this household tonight! To each their own. I think this is guy's film anyway. I don't know too many females that rave about Blade Runner (not even my wife). I also think that this film has a nostalgic value. I believe if you were alive and cognizant at the time this film was originally released it has a special place despite its shortcomings.

Simply put after watching the bare bones DVD for several years, the magic of Blu-Ray has let me see how enveloping this movie is. The score by Vangelis is perfect in almost every sense of the word, creating a tension filled fear that resonates throughout the movie. There is no real horror in this film, only the sneaking suspicion that this world is ours in the not too distant future. The severe overpopulation, the destruction of natural wildlife, and the onset of genius level IQ in computers are things that won't happen in the next 11 years, but could begin to show itself in 50 years.The joy of watching this movie though is how it reveals another layer to you with every viewing. The last time I watched it, I really could sense the acting of the Replicants. After all these were mostly B level actors performing as androids trying to come off as humans. They all nailed it perfectly (except Zora). Watching their eyes reset after determining that they had either achieved one more goal to their eventual meeting of Tyrell or knowing that what they were doing was clearly not working. Then watching Ford doing his best to present a unflinching work ethic in solving his goal of eliminating the other Replicants, you can see how Deckard's computer was turning inside as well.The main issue I always felt raised though was at which point in the development in AI in computers will they indeed be living? And if this point does come, will we be a fearful enough society to just systematically eliminate them? I don't know the answer to that question, but I know 50 years from now this movie will resonate in real life issues and be dissected by the top minds in the world. Philip K.

Rachel's first and second visits to Deckard's apartment which features one of cinema's great merging of image and music, the fleeting movement of shadow in Rachel's childhood photo, the truly moving revelation of Rachel's realization that her cherished memories are as cold and calculated as the world she inhabits, Zora's desperate and futile effort to survive and of course, Roy Batty's roof top moment of knowing what it means to be human (experiencing mercy, memory and the reality that it is all ultimately fleeting \"Tears in the Rain\") and an ending that is ours to interpret (audiences have been trying for 25 years) \"She won't live but then again, who does?\" I saw Blade Runner when it was the small type co-feature to \"The Wrath of Khan\". I'm sure the last dollar from \"Khan\" was spent long ago, still, this great and neglected film continues to find new audiences and challenge those who 25 years ago saw in it something special, something great.

Driving a nail through the very hand he will save Deckard with, the wind mills of man's futile search for youth, the dove (Holy Spirit whom he will release to the heavens upon his death), reaching out to save a falling Deckard with nail through hand, Deckard responds by spitting at him (as humanity spit upon Christ at Golgotha), Batty sharing the wonders his dying eyes had seen much as Christ shared the wonders of his Father in Heaven, \"Time to die\"-It is finished\" and of course, Deckards salvation and his understanding of Graft's final words and the true role of the unicorn (how could Graft have known of Deckard's dream of the unicorn?). Lastly, Deckards subtle acknowledgement of who and what he is and that the future though unknown is already foretold for all of us, replicant and human alike.

What are they supposed to be? Surely someone would have capitalised upon such wanton waste and stored the gas for heating. It is simply the director's triumph of imagery over logic. Already there is great concern about atmospheric pollution, global warming and so forth, yet our skies are nowhere near as gloomy as those depicted in the movie. Perhaps we lose the battle. But even that hardly explains why the interiors of buildings were so dimly lit. How could anyone see to work, let alone clean-up? Also, as these replicants were effectively regarded as machines, and highly dangerous ones at that, it is certain that they would have been fitted with some kind of tracking device like SatNav. Look how widespread that has become already. Furthermore, I rather think that a more effective method of dealing with them than just a modified handgun would have been devised. And why so little CCTV? Wouldn't there have been cameras in the lifts of the Tyrell Building? And what about security guards, intruder alarms etc. How could a replicant get to see the man himself simply by accompanying an employee? Try that in any major corporation today. Day or night, it just won't happen. This movie is a paradox. The very technology that creates these wonderful puppets would be spread throughout the world, checking-up on them and everyone else. '1984' was a much more accurate piece of science fiction. In Britain at least, it is almost fully realised. Actually what we have here is science fantasy, not fiction.As to sending one man with one side-arm to hunt for half a dozen dangerous opponents? No; that doesn't make any kind of sense at all. Especially when those opponents are strong enough to punch through walls and quick enough to dodge bullets.But if you can get your head around the one-sided and anomalous interpretation of technological development, and you can avoid chafing at the slow, slow pace of a fairly straightforward story, it's quite a mesmerising audio-visual experience that will linger in your memory. Commentators who see multiple layers of wisdom after viewing it dozens of times need to get a life; they remind me of those people who used to hear secret messages in old vinyl records when they were played backwards. If there's any subliminal instruction here it probably runs 'believe this movie is more than the sum of its parts'. What better testimony to the confusion of its message than that the director himself has so often re-written it?It is extremely elaborate in presentation, but a good artist uses your imagination rather than his own. He just scatters random and abstract clues and lets you deduce their meaning. Imagery so lends itself to interpretation in fertile (and gullible) minds.

Blade Runner is an extremely charismatic film. More than anything, it is just so dang beautiful to look at. The story on the other hand, is less pretty. Though the themes of the film are there, mostly thanks to Philip K. Dick's original source material. But so much work was spent on the look of the film, the characters are clearly an afterthought. There is such an underdeveloped set of characters and story, I'm not sure anything actually even happens in Blade Runner that is worth....well....happening. The android/Deckard undercurrent is there, but it seems thin. It feels thin. It is thin. Now Apocalypse Now ran into similar problems, but there was so much subtext with the material and so much interaction with the characters, there still was some narrative drive. Blade Runner struggles to engage me these days. The look of a film can be a major character just as an actor can be. But I don't think it may be a great movie because of that alone. This ain't 2001. If Blade Runner had a further developed character set, aside from Rutgar Hauer's wonderful Batty, there would be a monolithic masterwork here. Instead, we have an amazing exercise in style and nothing more.I am a professional photographer. I know light. Its my job to do so. I can tell an extremely talented man in the way of Jordan Cronenweth shaped the signature look of Blade Runner with Ridley Scott. Those shafts of light coming from nowhere have so much visual power. So on that basis alone, thin plot and characters aside, Blade Runner is still quite good at what it is, once you settle on that.My feelings about Blade Runner are similar as my feelings for some of the more beautiful women I have been with.

So many reviews have already been written probably containing what I have in mind myself. Another thing is that I have watched this movie (the original from 1982 that is) so many times and thought so much about it that it is difficult to state exactly what my opinion is. Having said that it is still one of my all time favorites. I give this 10/10 which I don't do very often, but this one deserves it.\"(Batty) I have seen things you people wouldn't believe. I have seen tank ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion, I have watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost, like tears in rain. Time to die\". - (Deckard) \"I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments he loved life more than ever. Not just his life. Anybodys life. My life.\" And then the Vangelis score. Truly a great moment in cinema history. Batty, who holds Deckards life in his hands chooses to save his life. Deckard who has hunted all the other replicants down, including Pris, is spared. Batty hereby shows us that he has developed one of the most defining characteristica of human beings; the ability to forgive. He shows us here that maybe he is \"more human, than human\" as stated by the Tyrell Corporation.I really think that it is easier to give a review if you are critical of what you have seen. Here in this movie every little detail seem to come together to create a masterpiece. Even a guy like JF Sebastian who plays a very small part in the movie gives a very disturbing appearance as the lonesome scientist with his aging disease and his little robots around him to greet him when he comes home in order to comfort him. How sad. Pris, as the replicant who has started to develop feelings towards Batty, the other replicant; probably the most hopeless love ever seen. They simply don't have a chance to fulfill that love at any level. Rachael, who is beginning to grasp that she is a replicant (\"how can they not know what they are\" (Deckard)) The \"I only do eyes\" guy (Hannibal Chew) who feels some sort of pride when confronted by Batty \"You are a nexus six right? I made your eyes\". And what does that smile mean that Batty sends him (if only you could see what I have seen with your eyes)? Every performance is memorable. The atmosphere is permeated by pessimism, estrangement and a sense of utter hopelessness. Ford of course plays his role with incredible depth. He is forced into this assignment, and he really plays Deckard as a man (or replicant) who has given up on himself and society. He does it because he doesn't really have a choice. He hunts the replicants down but without any pride or feeling of doing the right thing.Batty finally gets to confront Tyrell and gives him the \"kiss of death\". The anger behind this act has to do with the imposed misery of the replicants since they are given human thoughts and feelings but not the chance to live a life that makes it possible to reach any existential goals they might have. Tyrell is trying to make Batty accept this when he says to him: \"the flame that burns twice as bright burns half as long\" but Batty doesn't want a life that is half as long since it makes it impossible for him to reach self-actualization.We have seen the same kind of theme in Mary Shelleys \"Frankenstein\" where \"the monster\", because it only meets hostility and mistrust, at last becomes a true monster.This theme is still very much science-fiction but who knows if we some day will be able to create artificial life. If so we will need to answer those moral dilemmas that exists in doing so and it can be argued that \"Blade Runner\" tries to give us one version of how this can unfold.Regards SimonPs.

It's a pleasure to look at the amount of art and detail that went into this film, but the inner story, the real heart and substance of this work of art, is a little thin.Don't get me wrong, I like the film. I really do. I think it's one of the finer pieces of cinema, but, I don't hold it in as high a reverence as I used to ages ago as young impressionable sci-fi fan. Ridley Scott came out of the school of shooting commercials, and applies his style to a cross-genre of science fiction and film noir. We have a film that wants to be intriguing: One that wants to show us the struggle between man and his creations. But it's just not as powerful as it could have potentially been.I happen to be a big Ridley Scott fan. I think his films are exceptional. \"Blade Runner\" is no exception, but this film needs more umph to make it a real memorable picture in the vein of \"The Maltese Falcon\". What makes classic film noire memorable isn't the gun play or other violence, nor some of the incredible black and white photography and shadow play created by John Huston, but the characters and their dynamic.We actually have a bit of that in \"Blade Runner\" (in fact the whole film revolves around this), yet it's never fully realized. Instead what we have is a visually attractive picture telling what amounts to little more than a \"monster movie\". The monsters can talk and act like humans, but they're monsters all the same. In this sense there's little between this and Scott's other previous effort; \"Alien\".If you'r a die-hard sci-fi fan who loves this movie, and you've gotten this far in my comment, then you're probably shaking your head. It's okay. I understand. I was enthralled wit the visuals when I was younger (and am still impressed with them), but you have to understand what this film tells us about ourselves to really come to a clear minded conclusion about the quality of the story.Like I said, it's a very good looking film. Yet even here some of the art direction, particularly for the technology, is a bit over stated. Note Deckard's voice manipulation of a device that scans and manipulates a photo, or the controls and general human interface for the flying cars. Even so, those are things are needed to get the \"futuristic\" feel of the film across to the audience.It's a fine film, quite good in many areas, but not exceptional in all departments.

At the time the action and beautiful post-apocalyptic imagery is what drew my attention. The characters seemed very real to me, having odd \"ticks\" and very real reactions to the situations into which they are locked. Since that time, I joined the military and experienced life and my taste in movies changed.I came across Blade Runner in a store and bought it up to watch this childhood favorite of mine in a new light. As I expected, the storyline became the focal point for me. Deckard (Harrison Ford) became the battle-weary, hardened veteran faced with difficult choices that I have seen first hand in military service. I could completely relate. Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) wasn't the stereotypical replicant (cloned humans used for war) bad guy anymore, either. Now, to me, has become the victim of his own creation fighting against the system to live a life that he deems normal. The problem is that the system won't allow that since, being bred for war, replicants live to fight and kill. Being bred for the sole purpose of fighting wars, the replicants were given short lifespans of about 5 years, which Roy and his replicant gang are trying to overcome through unscrupulous means. Mainly through violence and murder.Meanwhile, Deckard is trying to track Roy down. You get to see clips of replicants receiving psychological evaluations. The purpose for those scenes, I assume, is to see how replicants are fundamentally different than a human being.The movie has a few surprises and Rutger Hauer's character, Roy, has a great feel and some very quotable lines.

I loved that version. Given, Harrison Ford's voice over sounds like he wasn't taking the ordeal too seriously, it unintentionally provided another layer for the movie.One of the things that stood out in Ridley Scott's vision of the future was how America was more than a melting pot, it was a blur of images of past, present, future and a blur of culture and ethnicity. In a word, it was a blur of identity. The voice-over, love it or hate it, always gave an almost non-time feel to the movie, combining old fashioned detective film noir to a gloomy, messy future. Looking back, many of the narrations feel silly, but it still added an additional layer to the film.Looking forward, the director's cut creates a different film. That idea of identity is further explored as the lack of narration makes Deckard's thoughts more ambiguous as his own identity is questioned. This version always created a sense of isolation and curiosity. Ridley Scott's vision seems more authentic.I always loved the non-CGI visual effects of the film, which still hold up to this day (if you don't believe that, then do not wait for the 5 disc DVD - rush to a city showing it on the big screen). In the early 80s, sci fi films were popular and while many were experimenting with new technologies, a lot of Blade Runner is old fashioned models, which blow away ANY CGI (note to George Lucas, Robert Zemekis and all cgi aficionados everywhere). The sets were great - the muddled future, looking like a New York Nightmare.But the simple story is what still stands out. Brushed off as a gloomy search and destroy pic in its original release, viewers now see the questions the film raises about humanity and identity, perhaps also raising eyebrows about how it all fits into science. The acting was always top notch, notably from Rutger Hauer who appears first as a classic villain but shows much more depth in his limited screen time. He's also got the best dialogue.Whatever version you watch of Blade Runner, you're always in for a classic. The vision of this film is unprecedented and something about it remains fresh 25 years on.

Ridley Scott has tinkered for the third time with his original work. In the 90s, his director's cut gave justice to the original piece, with no dopey narration by Harrison Ford, and a snappier ending. This time, it's just fixing famous gaffes and cleaning up the famous visual effects. I had the pleasure of seeing a showing of the \"Final Cut\" at the same theatre I saw the film throughout the 80's - the Uptown Theater in Minneapolis. I believe this is the fourth time I have viewed the film there. One thing you will be very impressed with is the quality of the print. This shall no doubt be obvious on the upcoming DVD release, as the colours are beautifully digitally enhanced. The visual effects also look very clean, and hold up very well. The cleaning up is primarily on the flying cars, they no longer have telltale black matte lines around them.A couple changes caused me to laugh out loud, however. First and foremost, is the infamous Snakemaker scene, where Deckard confronts the snakemaker in his shop. In all previous versions, you could easily tell that the dialogue did not match what was shot. Now, Harrison's CGI mouth magically is saying the correct dialogue, along with the Snakemaker. Another is the scene where Deckard kills Zhora, where previously it was obvious that it was a stunt woman crashing through the windows. Now she has the CGI face of Joanna Cassidy. Then there is a change in dialogue when Roy confronts Tyrell, instead of saying \"I want Life, f*cker\", he now says a more politically correct \"I want life, father\". Sure, it fits, but why bother when everyone knows that line so well by now? That scene also has additional gore as Roy stuffs his thumbs into Tyrell's eyes. Also fixed is the annoying shot as Roy releases the bird at the end, when originally the sky changed from dark and rainy to sunny and clear. Now the bird flaps away into a dark industrial CGI sky. The \"Final Cut\" thankfully has no drastic changes from the Director's Cut that came out in the 90's. Same beginning, same ending, same famous Unicorn question and same moody score (one of the best movie scores ever made). If you have the opportunity to see this print, do so. It was fascinating picking out details in the background, and scrutinising the visual effects (coolest looking scenery ever). For those who have never seen this film, please ignore some the clunky dialogue, and the ploddy pace. This movie is not a \"Terminator\" type of Sci- Fi thriller, it is a mood piece, dripping (literally) with atmosphere. For the uninitiated, the production design (conceived by Scott along with Syd Mead) inspired a new generation of Sci-Fi Grunge, where the future had a retro look to it, and had a noir quality. Christopher Nolan admitted that he based the look of the new \"Batman Begins\" franchise on Blade Runner. This movie still rates about an 8 out of a 10.

I know I saw that release, but cannot remember it after seeing the DVD.I would really love to sit next to Sir Ridley Scott for one good evening meal.

For example, Harrison Ford's lead character is quite understated, compared to any other role he's played, as far as I am aware. And I love his, and other, characters for that very reason.Yet there is more-than-ample plot to interest thoughtful audiences. This is _so_ refreshing compared to the usual Hollywood pandering to idiotic 12-year-old brains. For example, try a super-intelligent android who, knowing he must die soon, finally comes to understand, better than anyone else in the film, that killing in revenge just makes no sense at all. Think about it.Great film.

In the first Blade Runner we witness the snapping of an important man's neck. The one scene in the whole movie that I could have done without, but it didn't ruin the movie for me! At least it was an instant death. This time in the film, for some godforsaken reason, the director had the replicant's kill by pushing people's eyeballs into their brains. It's horrifically shown once and implied twice. Now what possibly does that add to the movie? Is society becoming so sick that Hollywood thinks that's entertainment? Are we so desensitized that gruesome violence no longer revolts? All it did was turn the bad guys (replicants) into monsters. One is left without an once of sympathy for them unlike in the original Blade Runner.Why flat? Well the speech at the end of the film by the dying replicant leader now rings quite hollow. Who gives a hoot what wonders he's seen. Just hurry up and die so you don't kill anymore decent people. While those replicant designers were short sighted and a certainly terribly naive, does that warrant a death sentence? The replicants are like spoiled children: If I don't get my way, I'm gonna throw a tantrum! In this case if you don't \"fix me\" I'm gonna push your eyeballs back into your brain! The other reason it left me flat was the \"boy meets girl ending\" is so trite! At least the original Blade Runner had what I would consider a passionate ending by a being that does not torture its victims.

According to the theory of materialism there are now no subjects, there is only subject-matter. Selves are nothing but electronic packets, while private persons are \"simulacra\", Rationalism rejecting the notion that there is some ineffable \"thing\" over the genetic, neurological and social coding that makes us \"us\", maintaining instead that the personal and the biographical are only explicable in machinic and impersonal terms. The question raised by film-fans \u2013 \"Is Deckard a replicant?\" \u2013 thus misses the implications of the film completely. The criteria for rating the human above the replicant have been evaporated. Deckard, like man, is a machine that thinks it is what it is not and is certain that it is not what it is. As all identity is construction, everything has been produced and nothing is given. As man is defended by his own narcissism, Deckard struggles to come to terms with this. Like most subjects faced with this trauma, he oscillates between retreating to either the Symbolic Order (the social world of linguistic communication\u0085of The Law) or The Imaginary Order (the fundamental narcissism by which the human subject creates fantasy images of both himself and his ideal object of desire), both of which are tragic flights.But, as philosopher Slavoj Zizek argues, the lesson of \"Blade Runner\" (or rather Philip K Dick's lesson) is not only that everything in the personal is in fact the product of impersonal processes of cause and effect, but that it is the very act of delineating the underlying nexus that regulates our lives, that marks our freedom. For this reason, \"Blade Runner's\" replicants are actually the film's only pure subjects precisely because they testify that their \"content\", including their most intimate fantasies, are not their own, but already implanted. i.e, it is only when I acknowledge my replicant status, that I become a truly human subject.What the film fails to do, however, is recognise that the \"replicant as pure subject\" is itself not an identity, but the product of a machinic process which mis-recognizes itself as the process's final cause. So rather than a subject, we have the continuous production of subjectivity (in which the personal is always the \"sim-personal\"; the simulation of the personal by the impersonal). In this algorithm, self-consciousness as pure introspection simultaneous with what it is introspecting, is impossible, as subjective reflection must always exists \"two steps removed\" or \"behind\" the process, consciousness, like memory and habit, always an \"after the fact\" reflection on the unconscious processes which produce it. In this sense, the subject is by definition always nostalgic, a subject of loss.For this reason, for the pure subject to have reflection is for it to automatically realise, nihilistically, that consciousness is itself nothing. Unless this happens, the replicant remains a \"simpersonator\", able to simulate personalities, but always confusing personality-function with consciousness-as-essence. In other words, unlike Deckard, the pure subject would not go from \"it does not know what it is\" to \"it now knows what it is\", but from \"it does not know what it is\" to \"it knows it cannot know what it is becoming\", which is the kind of morbidly fked up place Cronenberg now resides.But, philosophically, \"Blade Runner\" doesn't go this extra mile. If the film is about nostalgia and loss, it remains trapped on the level of thinking in terms of \"memories\" and \"death\". IE \u2013 whether replicant or human, memories aren't ours and all existence ends in death, as bemoaned by one dying, rain-drenched replicant.In this regard, the film is a lamentation more in the style of such Westerns as \"Once Upon A Time In The West\", \"Unforgiven\" and \"The Wild Bunch\". Indeed, \"Blade Runner's\" screenwriter, David Peoples, injects many western motifs into the film, borrows heavily from \"High Noon\" (a 1952 western that features a lone bounty hunter tasked with killing four outlaws) and would himself go on to write \"Unforgiven\". Fused with these are director Ridley Scott's motifs \u2013 an emphasis on eyes, photographs, pictures etc \u2013 (photographs are objects of place, sentiment, history, and memory. Similarly, phrases like \"we get the picture\" or \"world picture\" show that consciousness can be discussed in terms of a picture) all of which stress the recording and capturing of memories.Of course, stylistically, the film does borrow from the noir genre. Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a trench-coat wearing detective, navigating his way through a future Los Angeles every bit as oppressive as that of classic noirs. The film also deals with noir fate. But rather than the cosmic webs of betrayal so favoured by Chandler, here fate becomes the universality of death (programmed obsolescence) and the \"inescapability\" of the human OS, of source code Homo sapien. Incidentally, \"Blade Runner's\" \"elevator ending\" references \"The Maltese Falcon's\" \"elevator ending\", another noir which ended with the \"stuff that dreams are made of\". Fittingly, all those involved with the picture, EXCEPT Ridley Scott, believe Deckard to be human. Fancher and Peoples wrote about a human Deckard, Ford played a human Deckard, and yet Ridley Scott continuously states that Deckard is a cyborg. Of course, as director, Ridley Scott becomes the Noir God of the picture. He is the head of the Tyrell Corporation. He is the implanter of memories. He builds the androids, falsifies information, keeps them misinformed and in the dark. The film works precisely because Ford thinks he's playing a human whilst Scott KNOWS he is a machine.8.9/10 - Worth multiple viewings.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 6, "votes": 14}, "heading": "A Dick's Lament", "date": "2007-09-26T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1736557"}, {"content": "Blade Runner is a true science fiction classic.I first saw this at a young age and, although found it a bit confusing and slow at the time, was still taken by its striking visual power.

The film's use of dark sets, smoke, faded light, night-time rain, broken buildings, exotic people has effectively set the right mood for what PKD had dreamt of - a society on the verge of breakdown, living on the edge with crime, corruption and misused technology. All credits must go to the art/set directors, the cinematographers and of course to Mr. Scott himself.The original music is just breathtaking. Vangelis created the right sound for every mood, mostly dominated by paranoia and fear of the unknown. The use of foreign music in many scenes only add to the vision of cultural complexity.The director's cut is vastly superior than the original release not only because it excludes the voice-over, but because of the brilliant extra footage and altered ending.

Over the centuries, this statue has elicited great sadness and sympathy for the fallen warrior. Are there any Tragic Heroes in Blade Runner? Who comes closest is Roy Batty, endowed by his creator with superhuman beauty, intelligence, strength and will (Milton, anyone?). His tragic flaws were either flukes or intentionally built into him by his creator; his short life span was a precautionary measure, we are told. Tragically, his humanity developed too late.BLADE RUNNER is, in my opinion, also a work of art for the ages.Milton? you say. After seeing it in the mid-70's.

Yet, I prefer the original version of Ridley Scott's BLADE RUNNER that features narration. Read as a flat monologue by Harrison Ford, the narration is relatively minor and it is bland and lacking any sense of humor or style. And though it does provide some fresh details, it really isn't dramatically necessary. Yet, the voice-over works, I think, because it is so banal; in a film that relies heavily on style and visuals, the narration's absence of any sense of poetry grounds the film. It contrasts with the overwhelming stylistics of the film as a whole. It gives us something real -- something human -- in an overcrowded world of eye-popping fantasy.Director Scott -- as well as Ford himself -- are on the record as not liking the narrated version and when Scott got the chance to have his say on a quasi-director's cut, the studio-imposed narration was the first thing to go. And while his version, without the intruding words, is more solemnly impressive, it is also more desolate and aloof. Without the narration, we observe the action in BLADE RUNNER from a safe distance; with the narration, Ford's Rick Deckard talks to us and forces us to be his confidante. And I think that is essential to appreciating the film because otherwise it is difficult to care one way or the other about the character or his fate. One-dimensional and unsympathetic, Deckard is not the film's hero -- indeed, he is anything but heroic -- but in the end, all depends on whether he lives or dies and the fact that he has shared his thoughts with us makes all the difference.BLADE RUNNER is a strange hybrid of genres, an odd melding of the traditional film noir, with its peculiar sense of pragmatic morality, and modern sci-fi, with its darkly pessimistic and persistent distrust of both humanity and scientific progress. There is also an element of the traditional western, and its romanticizing of masculinity and individuality. Deckard is a retired cop, drawn back into service by the proverbial \"one last case.\" He is a \"blade runner,\" a policeman by law, but in this dark and murky vision of the future (circa 2019), he is more of a hired assassin, in reality a gunslinger or bounty hunter. His job is to track down and \"retire\" a quartet of humanistic androids -- replicants -- who were genetically constructed to be slave labor on some off-planet space colony. Though they were created with built-in expiration dates and are fated to die soon anyway, the four have violently rebelled and have come to earth to try to force the corporation that created them to somehow extend their longevity.Though now considered a landmark of sci-fi cinema, BLADE RUNNER was a box office flop when it was released and was greeted with critical indifference. This is understandable; released about the same time as E.T. - THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL, and on the heels of STAR WARS and RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK, the film represented a jarring difference in style and tone for audiences eager for upbeat sci-fi fantasy or thrilling matin\u00e9e adventures. And this was especially true given the presence of Ford in the starring role; there is nary a trace of Indiana Jones or Han Solo in Deckard and though Ford plays the part well, it is with a dour lack of enthusiasm. Deckard has a job to do and one that he doesn't particularly like; that is the closest he comes to acting heroic. Indeed, in the end, what many may have found hard to appreciate, if they grasped it at all, is that Deckard is the film's villain, a man with no soul who seeks to kill others because they are deemed less than human.There are two other points of contention brought up by Scott's revisionist view: One is his dislike for the film's so-called \"happy ending\" and the other his notion that Deckard is also a replicant (though Ford rejects this idea, insisting the character was always meant to be human). If Deckard is a replicant, the film gets an ironic twist at the end -- but it also robs the film of it's spiritual essence. The climatic moment of the story is when the last act of a dying replicant, Roy Batty, played by Rutger Hauer, is to save Deckard's life. If Batty saves Deckard because he senses he is a fellow replicant, it is an act of unity; but if he saves a human enemy, it is an act of forgiveness. As the narration explains, at death Batty loves life so much, he can't bare to take it from another. Batty receives redemption (and reveals he has a soul) by forgiving Deckard; Deckard's soul is reborn through Batty's generosity of spirit. And a beautifully ugly film about death becomes a film about the preciousness of life.The original ending, where Deckard and the replicant Rachel (Sean Young) flee to the country in the hopes of sharing a life, is optimistic, an underscoring of the idea of rebirth. It is vastly superior to Scott's preferred inconclusive ending, which suggests that the two are doomed fugitives. Though the studio-imposed \"happy ending\" was no doubt a purely commercial decision, it gives the film meaning in a way Scott's pessimism can't. Scott's vision of BLADE RUNNER is like a replicant, an engineering marvel and, like a machine, he assumes it is should run with cold, empty efficiency. But just as hope is what makes the replicants human, it is it's original message of hope that gives BLADE RUNNER its humanity.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 4, "votes": 8}, "heading": "Cutting edge", "date": "2007-07-22T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1698231"}, {"content": "In 1982 Ridley Scott sure was on fire with this directing and take on showing a future look of Los Angeles.

After being mercilessly slaughtered by critics at the time of its original release a quarter of a century ago, Blade Runner is now hailed by critics - probably many of the same as the most influential and visionary sci-fi film ever made. It is one of few select films which have had a great afterlife, long after they were originally released to an indifferent public.Undoubtedly, the VCR revolution of the early 80's was the saviour of Blade Runner. The incredibly detailed cityscapes, the wonderfully observed roles of the replicants with their various unique physical traits and mannerisms, and the searing vision of an over-populated, acid-rain drenched Los Angles, were scrutinised, studied and raved over by the midnight movie / art student crowd. Word of mouth grew over the years, generating a huge fan-boy subculture which exist to this day (indeed, try typing Blade Runner into your search engine and check out some of the stunningly designed fan sites dedicated to the film). Other film-makers started to steal many of the visual motifs and concepts of the film; which is probably one of the most referenced works of art ever produced. You can see Blade Runner steals in toys, computer games, virtually any Japanese Sci-Fi Manga / Anime (Akira and Silent Mobius are stand out examples), countless TV shows and of course other dystopian Sci-fi epics.So why the great influence? Visually, the film is still stunning, a totally convincing vision of a near-future LA of incessant pollution, commercial-drenched neon avenues and oppressive, towering skyscrapers. Pretty awesome when you think that CGI was only just rearing its head in the likes of Tron (released the same summer). The population is a broad mix of religions, races and languages, which is the way most major city centres are like now. Ridley Scott has never since achieved the same visual splendour \u0096 save perhaps for Gladiator \u0096 as this film.The story itself is a pretty standard hardboiled noir cop thriller, with Harrison Ford's weary, disillusioned cop (Blade runner) being forced to hunt down illegal artificial slaves (replicants) who have escaped from deep space colonies and are attempting to reach their creators (the Tyrell Corporation) in order to extend their 4-year lifespan.I won't tell the reader any more \u0096 It is for the fresh viewer to check out the details, I'll only give them the broad brush strokes.Let it just be said that Blade Runner is a powerful, evocative and truly astonishing picture that rewards the viewer every time you watch it.

The VERY NEXT DAY I bought it on VHS tape and watched it over and over and over again for about 3 days...why? It's a great interpretation of a sci-fi novel, an interpretation which (I believe) Philip K Dick himself approved of, shortly before he sadly died. At least, he did say that the environments (as realised by Sid Mead) were \"exactly as how I'd imagined it!\" High praise indeed. Thanks to Moebius and Heavy Metal also.Personally, I saw Blade Runner before I read the novel \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" I love them both, they both have a very strong atmospheric feel, which I think may have been why Dick was so impressed with the visualisations in the movie. Ridley Scott has created some VERY strong images in his directing career, Alien being another good example, but this movie has had such a strong effect upon so many other movies that it does warrant a special mention.It can be reduced in description to being an updated Film Noir, but that does not do it justice. A lot of Dick's themes of dehumanisation, alienation, globalisation and the struggle of individuals to exist in a increasingly inhuman world have endured and still echo in films to this day. In fact, Dick's writing (although partly inspired by his prodigious drug intake) was very humane and concerned for humanity. This theme is realised by the main protagonists and antagonists throughout the movie, resulting in a fascinating climax and, in the director's cut at least, a powerful and beautifully ambiguous ending.Well, it's just great. Some people pan it for being a triumph of style over content. To me, that's a bit like accusing Churchill of being 'a touch bombastic' or Hendrix of being too fond of 'freeform playing'. You have to admire the film for what it is, a pioneering and strong vision with some brilliant moments that rival anything that world cinema has shown us.

What remains after humans leave is an enormous amount of affordable housing, days blocked out by eternal clouds of pollution, and nights of eternal rain as the pollution cools and condenses.Then of course, is the usual plot about androids turned bad and the crazy cop waging a one man war against them.For the most part, the depiction of the future world is more convincing than any modern computer animation.

Then in 1982 Ridley Scott returned for his now superlative work, the ground-breaking masterpiece, Blade Runner. It remains one of the most controversial films ever made, due to the range of extensive cuts and edits which were performed by the producers. In 1992 Blade Runner: The Director's Cut was released. This marked a huge accomplishment for both Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford who have both cited the original version as \"fake\". Although Ridley Scott considers the Director's Cut to be rushed, it is still the version which he considers true to his original vision and there is no question about it, the Director's Cut is the only way to gain the true representation of the film's colossal greatness.Blade Runner is a vague adaptation of Philip K. Dick's, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and remains a polarising and visionary image of the possible dystopia the world could so easily become. The year 2019 and a \"techno-metro\" Los Angeles police-department known as \"Blade Runners\" pursue Replicants (genetically-engineered species which are almost indistinguishable from humans). The Replicants are deemed too dangerous for society and are illegal on Earth. Blade Runners are law-enforcement agents set to execute (\"retirement\") any Replicants which have found their way onto the Earth. Deckard, a retired Blade Runner is unwillingly called back from retirement to pursue four known Replicants who have gained entry into Los Angeles. There is a common misconception that films which have huge budgets and deal with weighty topics are not able to balance both intelligence and entertainment. Except, Blade Runner (although made on a large budget) is far from being a Hollywood film, which is of course a relief because today's Hollywood would rarely dream of letting a film like Blade Runner be crafted in the way it has been. They would want huge explosions, people running in and out of buildings shooting the \"bad guys\" and common-placed clich\u00e9s to please mass-audiences. Commercially, Blade Runner was a failure and views of the film were extremely diverse, this is just one of the reasons why the film has gained a cult success.Blade Runner is a film is so visually stunning that everything about it becomes etched on your mind. The opening shot of a huge dystopia stretching as far as the eye can see, while contrasting against the magnificent lights and colours illuminating the L.A sky is awe-inspiring. As the film progresses you become opened-up to a grim environment where there is little way of differentiating night and day and little way of knowing the time. It is a society overrun with consumerism, technology and most of all menace. It is an overwhelming atmosphere, filmed with grim beauty and visceral flair, an environment where everything is busy, yet people are lonely inside. In a way it is a society where paranoia is quite apparent and nobody is oblivious enough to truly ignore it. The score is another one of the film's many fantastic technical achievements, it perfectly adds to the film's haunting and sombre mood.The retro set-pieces are vibrantly detailed, echoing the shades of techno-noir from the use of camera movements, to other elements such as character personalities, traits and actions. The incorporation of \"femme fatale\" is another method used to emphasise the film's shady noir. Then you have the use of symbolism, moralistic undercurrents and the religious imagery (such as the film's significant chess game). In addition, Blade Runner has political (Japanese culture being a strong-hold for American culture) and social subtext (businesses overriding people). You could even go so far as saying the film's main focus is on the individual sorrow of \"what Deckard really is\".Blade Runner is a film whereby the narrative is so involving and relentless that it is impossible not be compelled by the film's infinite selection of material to scrutinise and discuss for hours on end. The acting from the entire cast, notably the performances from that of Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer adds to the film's emotional complexity. Harrison Ford gives the performance of a lifetime; a timeless performance of a man's tortured \"soul\".Blade Runner is a film of thought-provoking ambiguity, conflicting view-points and dramatic emotions. Even on my consistent viewings of Blade Runner I still gain the cold feeling I got the first time when I saw the stunning array of beauty of the film holds, even in the darkest of moments. Ultimately, Blade Runner remains a poignant reminder to how artificial-intelligence could quite possibly become only too \"human\" and man's hopeless pursuit for immortality.

A true director's cut would have included scenes omitted by producers for lack of money and time during production. The narrated version has been viewed so extensively that the ambiguity and subtlety intended by the director will never be widely experienced.That said, the confusing and legendary production hassles associated with this film did little to reduce its impact since the real star of the film is the visual interpretation of a future world full of pollution, advertising and proletarian masses. Superimposed is the story of a hunt for renegade androids, but that is secondary. The poignant and depressing mood, highlighted with moments of nobility and love, presents an antidote for Scott to the criticism of his previous Alien, scorned by some critics as a hunt for a monster in a rubber suit.Comparison to the movie's handling of the nature of the androids and the hunters to that of Philip Dick, the author of the novel on which it is based, provide thematic intrigue. Are the androids admirable despite their brutality? Are the humans, despite theirs? Has the inhuman environment created a world where nobility is impossible, or can love transcend such degradation?On first viewing, themes and story elements matter little. You'll revel in the mood and luscious visuals complemented by an achingly sad Vangelis music track. Bilious gas plumes, giant Gaudian advertising blimps, 800-story urban pyramids, skyscrapers with moving billboards on their sides--all at night, with a constant dreary rain--provide enough distraction to make even a movie without substance watchable. But this isn't \"2001 - A Space Odyssey,\" which gets so bogged down in visuals the story explodes. Harrison Ford falls for Sean Young--a replicant like those he hunts. Whether they manage to live happily ever after or if Ford's character is human are two of the unanswered conundrums in the script.Despite Blade Runner's flaws, it remains an enduring classic far surpassing its original cult status.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Brilliantly staged classic", "date": "2007-04-22T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1641987"}, {"content": "I have watched two Top-250 movies back-to-back and was disappointed by both. Blade Runner is slightly better than The Third Man, which I watched last night and nearly fell asleep. Actually I nearly fell asleep watching BR as well.The movie takes place in 2019, with an ultra-futuristic and depressing setting. The bleak insight into the future was simply a product of it's time - 1982 saw double-digit unemployment rates, more than 14 percent mortgage rates, and high oil prices.For a science fiction movie, it certainly moves slowly - though the pacing and rhythm is consistent. They've added a lot of stuff that just didn't fit in - as some have already mentioned, the unicorn in Drecker's dream and the mustached man appearing at the end. The woman who Drecker falls in love with is a distraction as well. The character development was quite poor. I had difficulty rooting for any particular character in this film.After watching a bad movie the night before, I really wanted to like Blade Runner. Unfortunately, behind all that science fiction action and distraction, is a thin predictable plot. The plot holes and ambiguous scripting doesn't do justice either. But I think the real flaw in BR was that the Replicants resembled actual humans. Therefore it was hard to see them as being artificially created.Rating: 6.5 of 10", "rating": 6, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 7, "votes": 17}, "heading": "Overrated", "date": "2007-04-11T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1635708"}, {"content": "I can't believe I've never seen this until now; it fits right into my favourites mould of dark, near-future setting with noir-ish stories and lots of eye candy. I guess I just never got around to it; now that I've seen it, I'm sorta glad I waited, as I would have found it boring when I was younger. As I remember, I started watching it once but could never finish it. Now that I've seen it for the first time as a (at least partially) mature film lover, I can fully appreciate its brilliance. And it is brilliant.Definitely one of the most visionary films I've ever seen; it's right up there with 2001 in being incredibly ahead of its time, both visually and thematically. As a result, both films are able to transcend their release year, and both feel as though they could have been made today. The two films are kinda counterpoints to each other; while 2001 presents a relatively light future, this film is dark, dark, dark. The wide shots of futuristic Los Angeles are both stunning in their visual presentation and terrifying in their historical implications. The numerous and at time enormous advertisements show a world with capitalism run amok - not something terribly surprisingly given our world today. This film is 25 years old, but somehow it manages to be relevant even today.The story is a combination of two of my favourite genres: film-noir and science fiction. I'm not sure, but I think this is the first cinematic combination of these two, something that has be re-done many times since. Some may think that the film moves too slow, but I was captivated by the story almost instantly. I would have liked to see more of Deckard's detective work, but there's ample amounts to satisfy my taste for mystery. The issues of humanity that it raises are intriguing and quite revolutionary, and the director's cut - which I saw - leaves the ending ambiguous as to Deckard's true identity. In fact, it leaves the entire film ambiguous - does Roy know Deckard? Is Deckard the 'missing' replicant? Utterly brilliant.I don't think I can really do the visuals justice in words. Suffice to say, this is one of the most stunning films I've seen - ever. The effects would be amazing today, and the fact that it's from 1982 makes it even more incredible. The dark view of the future is achieved mostly by the terrific production design - something like 1940s Los Angeles with a digital edge. Not only does it look great, but the design is smart as well; it makes sense that immigration would get even worse in the future, so the city and its design is multicultural and multi ethnic. And the music, while obviously from the '80s, fits perfectly. Technically superb.Though I've only just seen it for the first time, I feel confident that this will wind up in my all-time top ten after watching it again. I don't remember ever being this blown away by a film upon first viewing: it usually takes multiple viewings for me to really love a film.

My only problem with it, is that it was just the more expensive Terminator in some ways. But I did enjoy the story, despite how weird it was, it is a film I haven't really seen. I loved the effects, it just amazes me how realistic they were compared to today's technology, not to mention the moral of the story still needs to be recognized in today's society.In the year 2019, we have created a type of machine, looks and acts like a human, only they are stronger and smarter, they are called Replicants. But due to a violent act they are forbidden from entering planet Earth; 4 replicants have made it to Earth and want their lives expanded from 4 years to so many more. Rick Deckard, a retired Blade Runner, rejoins the force to stop these replicants, but ends up realizing who might be the true enemy.It's very interesting and very visually stunning, but I wasn't incredibly impressed, at least with all the hype I heard with it.

It isn't one of most science fiction films, which are in a very rare and fictional context; this film is very close to the real future, even today, at 25 years of its release date. It is also a very good drama. It appreciates the human being, and shows it's emotional superiority towards machines; it shows the interior superiority of humans. It is a very poetic film. It also has of the best music and a very good actuation from Harrison Ford All this shows that, in conclusion, it isn't only a perfect film in it's science fiction side, it is perfect as a drama too, and has excellent music themes.

It is even harder to comment on the technical aspects in such a way that Philip K Dick might approve.So I shall instead try to write in laymens terms as succinctly as I may.Los Angeles 2019 .. From the beginning, we are given the opportunity to traverse a panorama of majestic beauty. The beauty of a dark, rain infested city set in the future. As we take this tour the atmosphere is punctuated by fireballs thrust up by dark towers and spires; much like torches burning on a great red carpet that leads us into greater visual treats.It seems that Los Angeles is under considerable Japanese influence, with not much room given to its former Hispanic dominance. From the giant advertisements hugging the tall buildings to the food outlets to the citizens on cycles, we realise that the superior advancements of the Asian east have finally bled into the west to the extent that it has its feet are fimly under the table. This actually adds to the experience, in my opinion. The basic premise is that Deckard (Harrison Ford) is summoned and assigned to investigate the hijacking of an aircraft, or airship by a small number of 'skin jobs', or Replicants. It seems that there is no other choice to accept, and so with a reluctance, but eventual determination Decker sets the wheels in motion. Visually, the film is exemplary; and rather than the visuals, though indeed being special effects, are not blatant to the eye. Not like the recent Star Wars movies where the blue screen green screen is so obvious that although the fans, and non fans can enjoy the film, the suspension of disbelief is not entirely possible.The acting is flawless throughout. Harrison Ford, James Olmos, and others of a high caliber lose themselves in their characters. Perhaps the award should go to Rutger Hauer; who's character goes from bad guy, to seemingly not so bad character, once his motives and pathology are realised. After all, what, we can ask ourselves, would we ourselves do in such a predicament?The ending sequence, which I will not give away can perhaps only be described as a thing of beauty and marvel. Hauers monologue and final demise is quite incredible.Without forgetting what could be considered to be the crowning spice of the film, step forward the score.Vangellis delivers an operatic masterpiece. A flavour to not only compliment the experience, but transport the senses where even perhaps the visuals may fail. The score, and motifs within help keep this dish in the flavour that it has retained, and will keep retaining even after decades of release. This film does require an audience of some appreciative mind frame. Those with short attention spans that bring phones into theatres, though I stereotype will more than likely not enjoy this experience. It takes an appreciative eye to savour this for what it is, and that is quite simply . .An exemplary slice of science fiction.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 6}, "heading": "In every way, a magnificent beauty.", "date": "2007-03-17T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1619125"}, {"content": "It seems that the best ideas explored in science fiction originated in the minds of authors like Philip K. Dick and W. Burroughs. Blade Runner evolved from their ideas, and is an inspired project that really deserves respect.I was very young when I first saw the movie on its initial release. My friends and I were stunned. We didn't have the wherewithal to properly verbalize what we came away with, but we knew we loved it.This movie accomplishes something very few works do, it provokes that profound sense of how strange it is to be a human being, and that it's truly difficult to imagine any alternative.It's interesting to note that the \"replicants\" are referred to in the movies opening as \"robots\" when they are in fact organic, genetically engineered...humans. This is an example of how we structure morality on what's convenient or essential for our continuation, not necessarily survival, but so-called progress. In Blade Runner replicants are required for the colonization of other planets. Society side-steps the moral implications, referring to replicants as robots and to killing them as retirement. It's great that the story focuses on these profound issues rather than space battle action type stuff. That is in fact quintessential to the nature of the story, it's not about what happens on the front lines, but in the dark recesses of a world left to die.There's so many cool ideas in this film. There are layers of interconnectedness that reach beyond the story. The fact that the hotel in which Sebastian lives was the hotel used to film the Outer Limits episode \"Demon with a Glass Hand\", which explores similar themes about what it is to be human, is an example.A friend of mine tells me he was instructed by an architect who worked on the film's sets. After filming the architect had the sets burned, so that they wouldn't appear in any subsequent projects. The film makes ample use of stone columns and pylons, and it's great how old structures are situated alongside huge new ones. The backdrops are rich in detail, nothing is plain, and there's strange uncharacteristic things like small fires in the street's gutters.One of the ideas in the film is Philip K. Dick's concept of \"kipple\", the unwanted and useless junk that accumulates and tends to reproduce itself. The Blade Runner world is full of it, and its presence seems to reflect the situation of humanity itself, reproducing, accumulating, spreading through the universe, blind to any purpose, and incapable of knowing what the ultimate outcome will or even can be. The film's dialog also subtly reflects this, Gaff tells Deckerd; \"It's too bad she can't live, but then again, who does?\" The different ways of interpreting this statement are typical of the film's deliberate ambiguousness, it's not only a statement about mortality, but existence versus living. Both meanings are equally valid. Fortunately, the story isn't compromised with some kind of resolution, religious salvation, or final answers. It's lack of closure gives it more impact.Technically the movie is brilliant, the look and feel of it aligns perfectly with the story. At first I was disappointed that the director's cut removed the narration, probably because it was the version I was used to. But the director's cut works a little better I think, and it's a bit darker without Harrison Ford's vocal interjections. The movie does have some strange, cheesy quirks, but on repeated viewings they don't have as much impact because you know they're coming.A great film, it's hard to imagine a science fiction film that could equal it.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 4, "votes": 8}, "heading": "Unparalleled", "date": "2007-03-12T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1616500"}, {"content": "Ridley Scott's film Blade Runner is, quite simply, the most awe-inspiring and breathtaking film made to this date.

Vangelis created a style that in its simplicity strikes you far more as being of the future than any more sophisticated electronic music could ever do.The thing I was referring to in 4. is a grown up without experiences of his own. That is a logical impossibility, a paradox. But paradoxically it's one of the most powerful stimuli of existential reflection that were ever shown in cinema. The point being that it lets you ask yourself what all your experiences were good for.Not quite so subtle, yet still of interest, is the idea that you could be born into life knowing full well what your purpose is and how long you'll live. What does that do to you? The film answers that though, it's unacceptable, you'll deny it, seek something else, something more. It just cannot be that everything will be lost like tears in rain.But human ambition is a much broader theme of this film. The world itself, in which Blade Runner takes place, is a statement about the human longing for progress and power, his forwardness and his backwardness. Some concepts seem ridiculous from nowadays perspective, but the overall atmosphere is right on the spot.

At first glance, it can be a bit slow. It's told in a classic film noir fashion, so this is to be expected. Director Ridley Scott seems to want to savor every shot, and an astute audience will be able to sense this.Now, I say the film is told in a classic Noir style, but this can be misleading. There is no Humphrey Bogart in Blade Runner, snapping off brilliant one-liners once a second. Only hopeless people, in many ways victims of the merciless world of which they are all a part. Deckard is a typically downbeat protagonist, a hard-boiled cynical leading man with a weakness for heavy drinking. The plot is a mystery in name only, as the audience is allowed to know what Roy Batty, Pris and Leon are all up to before Deckard ever finds out. This only lends to the dread and inevitability of the film, lending further to its pervasive gloom. There is no final scene at the end where the bold detective puts all the pieces together and says \"Ah-Ha!\". Instead, we find Rick Deckard questioning his own existence and drinking away his constant doubts, all the while embroiled in a romantic relationship with someone he's sworn to kill.Blade Runner requires audience participation, particularly in the Director's Cut, which is entirely devoid of some rather necessary exposition provided by the Original Cut's much-maligned voice-over. Certain facts will not be clear even at the end of the film, requiring personal interpretation in order to be appreciated fully. Other facts will be given away in much more subtle ways than in most modern cinema, such as through visual cues and tenuous dialogue.Finally, visually, this movie is quite simply a science fiction triumph. It looks better than modern computer effects in every way that counts. Superimposed special effect objects don't give off that unnatural, clearly computer-generated \"Lord of the Rings\" sheen common in today's effects-driven blockbusters. This, of course, is because Blade Runner - while a gorgeous movie - is not effects driven in the least. Rather, it is a visually driven story that doesn't rely on special effects.

Flying cars and sky taxis also look pretty convincing.Score and music of the movie manage to give moody ambiance of the dark future and also using of synthesizer works well in haunting scenes.In a philosophical perspective, Blade Runner forces its audience and asks \"What makes us different than artificial\" or being an artificial makes them less human.

Perhaps as a commentary on the Replicants and the future which Scott has created, he may have chosen a sterile environment on purpose, as to gauge what we believe makes us human.

In fact, this gloomy/doomy scenario is vastly different, given how the book is COMEDY... and not even necessarily 'black' at that ! Mr. Dick, famously, saw things through rather 'rusty' rather than 'rosy' spectacles, but his novel IS funny, and fun to read, whereas \"Blade Runner\" (which in fact is a name borrowed from ANOTHER source, entirely), is completely lacking in humor on any level, unless you find it funny to be asked about your mother, and react by 'offing' someone for posing that question.And, contrary to what the first reviewer states, I happen to feel that WITH the added 'Voice Over' and PERHAPS with the 'happy ending' (that being a rather relative term), the movie as first presented IS 'closer' to the novel... at least, the novel's quality is reminiscent in hearing the Voice Over content, which sometimes even borders upon a sort of ironic humor.Someday, if we are lucky, someone WILL make a version of this movie that IS faithful to the book, and we will all be the better off for it ! Meanwhile, let me make clear that I am a long-standing and well-versed avid fan of Science Fiction, and to call this POSSIBLY, even, \"The Best Sci-Fi Film EVER\" is really a misjudgement. I am well aware that there IS quite a 'cult-following' and a plentitude of fans for this movie, who may argue over the merits of its two different releases (and I happen to own BOTH), BUT...Might I suggest that the ORIGINAL \"War of the Worlds\" (tho' laughingly dated by the 50's cars in it), and \"The Forbidden Planet\" (with an unfortunate all-Theremin soundtrack) are tons better VISUALLY ? Yes, Blade Runner presents some very interesting and visually astute views, but, so what ? It is rather bleak, and not terribly stunning. \"This Island Earth\" is another 50's era Sci-Fi that I happen to like, not one that I would say is 'possibly the best ever' but one that I would vote for as having one of the best TITLES of 'all time' and a Flick with some very interesting visuals... (too bad the original has gotten censored and cut, there was a rather 'shocking' scene with nudity when the two main protagonists get 'prepared' for space travel... but, then, the 'creatures' in it are a bit too laughable by today's standards).All three that I mention should be seen before voting for 'Best Ever' I think. Too, consider \"The Day Earth Stood Still\" which unlike the others is B & W, and has even more 'weaknesses' as far as Special Effects go, BUT it tells an important and meaningful 'story' delivering a significant 'message' that is still as relevant today as it was so many decades ago !

It's about landscape, it's about city, as reflex of civilization. It's about correcting our present, knowing what happened in the past. And so, the future is used, so the sci-fi mood is brought. Paradoxal it may be, the future tense gives the viewer the necessary distance towards what he is supposed to \"see\". And what you see is in here fundamental, not because of the spectacular sets, not because the astonishing prediction of what city will be in years to come but because it only shows what's already in front of us. Practically every sci-fi film that tries to predict an entirely new city is based on what is \"futuristic\" in the time of its idealization, from visual power masterpieces like Metropolis, to franchised versions of a future world like Demolition Man. Ridley Scott proposes a city that exists already, today, now. We get to the future through present, our present and that links us to it where the future tense gave us distance. Everything is deliberately thrown in a dystopic, chaos like package, that shakes, not because it's dark and rainy, but because it's in a city that exists now, and in buildings older than a century now. Sebastian lives in a neoclassic building from probably end of XIXth century, the routs of everything clearly bad and distorted and perverse in this Scott's future are clearly anchored on our present. Obviously every sci-fi director is before anything else, an earth inhabitant, so his base is his reality as a earthier, but in here, he makes the effort to through that at the viewer.So, everything is classical, Sean Young, a replicant that doesn't know it, has a classical beauty, the characterization, the way she moves, the way she talks. She plays the piano. She has a memory. She is human, except for the fact she is a replicant, created by men and that's where man is elevated to the category of god in the exact measure that he creates with the same perfection as Him. The camera is Deckard, the camera is the observer and this observer works in the top of the buildings, works above humanity, works on the last floor of Tyrell's Olympus like industrial complex. What is made in here is a change in time scale notion in order to get us, as viewers, down to earth. If god is eternity, and men's life is a second in eternity; what we see here is Men's life becoming the possible eternity and the replicants' 4 years life just a small passage in reality. Whenever replicants are referred in Blade Runner it is in fact me who is being referred. Ultimately, this may be about falling to earth with the notion that time is precious, and 4 years can be a long time, if well used. \"all those moments will be lost in time like tears in rain\", says Rutger Hauer's character.This is about keeping memory for eternity, whatever that is.Men is reflected on his creation, his imperfections, but also his qualities, show up in what he creates. So, throughout the film, we come to change our view of the replicants, from menace to empathy, from desire to eliminate (as survival instinct) to desire to embrace and consequent emptiness for their disappearance. That's when replicants become men, that's when we know he's not talking about robots, but us. \"petty she won't live, but again, who will?\" this is bottom line, nothing lasts forever, creator or creation. Still, facing the inevitability of death doesn't stop Deckard from running for life, or replicants from trying to live.Another aspect is that there is no \"soundtrack\", there is no \"music\" in this one, only \"soundscapes\", as dystopic as the city, as dark as this future, as empty as no future. Those sounds are the story of that city, are the story of our past, as told in our present, where there is no memory, where memories are forgotten, or made up as, once more, a survival device. Memory is a pillow for emotions, says Tyrell, he is god, he knows emotions are needed in order to exist, but he also knows he can't perpetuate lies about it, he knows he will die.Ultimately this may be a film noir anchored sci-fi film which, if well explored, could become a genre in itself. Checking it, you will find practically every aspect of film noir in it. For every aspect I referred, i believe this to be the essential sci-fi film, fulfilling completely the role that sci-fi was always supposed to have, but hardly ever had. Between 1979 with Alien and 1982 with this one, Ridley Scott moved definitely forward in understanding what science fiction is, and how it should leak into film making. Every artist has his limits in innovation and creation, apparently Scott's limit was defined here.

In this age of CGI, the environment created for this film has still never been equalled. It is not just the intense layering and detail, it is also the pace which we move through the environment that is just as important. Allowing us time to rest and contemplate the surroundings, along with the magnificent music, brings out so much more atmosphere and sense of place. The acting is interesting, mixing low-key realism with the highly theatrical style of Hauer and Turkel. Yet that mixing never feels out of place. Also, the important ingredient Ridley has in BR that has been lacking in some of his subsequent efforts, is a rich, multi-levelled story. The existential aspects, what is human, real versus artificial memories, the unanswered questions.

But in previous comments the idea of the film was completely misunderstood. Thats why this film is seen as a film, where graphical/stylistic effects seem to count more then the plot. This is definitely wrong! 1. The uprising of the replicants: It was not an revolt of the 4 nexus6 replicants, now illegally on earth. The uprising took part in earlier years, when replicants were allowed on earth. This lead a general prohibition of replicants on earth. The only place they are allowed are the off world colonies - where they are kept as \"working slaves\".(There is an incoherency in the film/book, because there is at least one (or two -see below) replicant on earth: Rachael. But that might be a licence for the corporation, that is designing them. Whatever - thats not clear in the film) 2. All 4 replicants seek longer life. Their lifespan has been limited to 4 years (security reasons are one argument; another is their intellectual superiority - incoherency number two) 3. The storyline is not (as usually supposed...) Blade Runner against Replicants, due to a)Rachael. She and Deckard fall in love. Deckard (Blade Runner) himself seems to be a replicant. This is shown in comments of his police superior, which is telling him: \"To bad she won't live. But then again, who does?\" The second hint Deckard gets is a paper-work, left by the same person. That paper work is mirroring a unicorn, an animal that Deckard constantly dreams of. Due to their programming, replicants have a manufactured memory. Do his \"collegue\" is telling him, what he had to tell Rachel during their second meeting.So, lets get this short: The film is working on at least two very philosophical topics. What are the boundaries of \"humanity\". Is life, that is artificially designed, less valuable than \"100% organic\" life. In the realization of this topic their are plenty of allusions to points like \"fatherhood\", the status of God, etc.. Cognitive solipsism and the boundaries of our own perception. Like Rachael, Deckard is (in the end) not sure about his \"personality\". While he is in the first place referring to Rachael as a \"machine\", he first looses this idea of his and at the end is completely unsure about his own status. To what extend is it possible, that his memories are just artificially created/designed? Is his personality just a fiction, etc..Another topic are the citations or the \"hypertextuality\" of the film. There are bunches of biblical allusions (mostly apocryphic, from the exodus and some from the genesis - mostly transformed, o give them a different meaning) and bunches of romantic references (Blake's \"America. A Prophecy for instance). If they are twisted or in versed, they anyhow refer to the books, and kind of actualize their content. So a quite intelligent interpretation of the film would only be possible, if these citations would be considered. They have to be taken serious, or the interpretation of the film will be the usual: \"Quite good, but has a focus on the stylish effects and its plot does not go too deep\".Sorry, but films (and their interpretation) depend on the mind, that is willing to reflect on them.I would love to argue much longer and more persistent on these points but my lack of English sets quite a limitation and the more I write, the more mistakes you will find.

Some movies in this category are: the Star Wars trilogy, Poltergeist, and even The Terminator. Then there are movies like Blade Runner, where one leaves the theater, or turns off the DVD player, scratching his head. Movies like Poltergeist and The Terminator work because both stories revolve around ordinary people with ordinary lives to whom the viewers can relate. Star Wars, while not completely relatable, has such an interwoven, tightly knit story in a fantastic world, that viewers can imagine the existence of such world. Even further, viewers know how to adapt to this world to the point where they can play dress up, speak Wookie, and recreate this environment. I've never heard of a Blade Runner convention.This movie wants so bad to be taken seriously, or does it? The soundtrack alone contradicts itself. The title sequence begins silently with a few heavy pounding beats and shrilling chords, making the viewer believe she is about to experience something along the lines of a war film, or better yet, a thriller. The movie's prologue somewhat adds to that assumption, although it's a little wordy and complicated of a background for the viewer to completely understand. Replicants bad. Humans good. Why? Dunno.After the serious introduction, the film loses credibility with its choice of bizarre magical fairy notes as though the story was a Read Along and it was asking its viewer to turn the page. Yes, the movie was made in 1982, but so was Poltergeist. And even then I am sure people were associating that sound of chimes with whimsical fairy dust. The sound often implies that something supernatural or magical has or is about to occur. However, it was just odd.There are other contradictions in the film, mainly the Replicants themselves, which left me with many questions. Why were Replicants created? If they are dangerous and illegal aliens then why is the Tyrell Corporation still producing them? Why are Replicants made in the first place if they are not supposed to exist? What is their beef with humans? What is humanity's beef with Replicants? Roy and Leon can handle sub temperatures like pros but Pris freaks out about a little rain? Am I supposed to feel sorry for Rachael? Why did Roy save Rick? What did Pris's acrobatics have to do with anything? Why didn't Rick retrieve his gun after he dropped it? Was climbing out onto the windowsill and scaling the side of the building really his best option? What's with: the guy with the mustache; the boiling eggs; the singing Japanese/Chinese lady; smoky/misty rooms and the city being foggy; the unicorn and the photos? Finally, how come the Replicants can run through sheets of glass, ram their heads through walls, and drive nails into the palms of their hands, but they fall down dead after one gunshot?

Let's get things in perspective: the human-robot theme, its implications on the human condition and one freaky looking professor genius 'playing God' having created it all is NOT what I call an intriguingly abstruse view on man and his role in life. I call it very, very clich\u00e9 and done about a thousand times before, during and after. And all the while I was reading about Scott's stupendous vision and take on man's complexity and how he forced the viewer to see things his way. Let's get things in perspective once again: Scott is a (good) director, but as with any director, his main task consists of telling actors where to go and stand and how to deliver their lines, only occasionally conferring with the writer as to how this or that scene might be interpreted and filmed. In this particular film, it seems to me that Scott's main contribution was him incessantly coaxing one or other stage hand to set the smoke/water-machine to full blast! There wasn't one scene without smoke or water: it's not difficult then to create 'an awesome atmosphere, presaging the dark reality of what human life is surely to become'. The film for me is a simplistic, superficial little story told in a pretentious and portentous manner, apparently convincingly enough to fool so many into thinking that here is a true cinematographic masterpiece that will stand the test of time.

However, this movie was celebrated by the foreign presses as well as the off beat movie critics. The reason why these sources praise this movie are not for the obvious mainstream storytelling devices that it doesn't use, but for the subtle grace and style of narrative that it employs through out.First off, the action in this movie, which for a science fiction piece is bordering on non-existent, is so layered with style that we tend to forget that what we are watching would be, if filmed in a typical mainstream way, not only thrilling but also jilting to the conscience because of its violent nature. However, because such style and finesse is implemented in the filming it is almost missed. This happens due two reasons. One, the entire film is extremely darkly lit, but the action scenes (except for the final scene) are all well lit which separates them from the rest of the narrative to the degree that they become isolated in our viewing experience so much so that they are subverted to the backs of our minds, to be nearly forgotten. Two, when the first action scene occurs with Deckard in the mix, it is played out in a slow motion sequence with eerily peaceful slow- jazz horns playing, so that the violence almost becomes a thing of beauty to be savored like a work of art that captures your soul.The lighting (or lack there of) and the music play significant roles in all the remaining remaining action sequences. In fact, they build in a reverse crescendo which effectively highlights by way of isolation the movie's crescendo, and thus bringing film to a thrilling conclusion of both aesthetics and action.Definitely what I would call a neo-noir-thriller classic!", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 2}, "heading": "A subtle killer.", "date": "2006-10-16T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1498602"}, {"content": "I saw Blade Runner in the theater when it was first released in 1982.

First i am appalled by the reviews i read saying that this movie looked visually stunning even in today's CGI era. To all those that believe this to be true i beg you to go to your doctor and get your cataracts examined as i am fearful to drive the same roads as you. Every scene involving a visual effect was so clearly fake that it is hard to give this world of the \"future\" much credibility as a real living and breathing entity. This highlights one of the first major mistakes Scott made in directing this movie. It is impossible to have a movie that is timeless when it is so clearly a casualty of the post Kubrick sci fi era of the early 80's. Why is it that the future world so resembles the 80's with its harsh lighting, big hair, punk rocker leather, and neon signs? Wouldn't the people of the future learn from the appalling aesthetic mistakes of the long forgotten 80's? Apparently not. Although it's clear Ridley Scott wanted to make the world dystopian and harsh it is so forced and so touched by 80's influences that it loses traction in the modern era. The good scenes, the ones that highlight the timeless nature of this film, are those that are inside and devoid of special effects. These scenes call a striking resemblance to the re noir movies of old with the long shadows that are cast and the gritty appeal they lend to the lonesome detective Harrison Ford portrays. So enough with the setting and abysmal effects and on to the story. Now overall the questions raised by this movie are not in the least original (read Frankenstein by Mary Shelly) nor mind blowing but they are none the less important. I praise any director who creates a movie in search of a higher meaning, a more important purpose than sheer entertainment, but i cannot laud a film that is completely devoid of believable action or a large enough explanation of its narrative. Many positive reviewers cite the film's ambiguity as its strength but i find this most foolish as the best of movies are able to spur debate while not being lost in their own vagueness. We know very little about Harrison Ford's character and the endless debates that follow around him are not in my opinion an extension of Scott's brilliance but rather a display of his contempt for his simple minded audience. The actors, with exception of Ford, are seemingly confused and out of place and so serious and so apathetic that it is impossible to care about them just as the world they live in cares little for their existence. They are all also so clearly displaced from the 1980's into 2017 culture which, as noted earlier, obviously has gained little in the way of advances. The Chemistry between Ford and his \"replicant\" lover is so inexistent that it makes me question whether or not this was Scott's intention. Perhaps it is just another buried metaphor about the nature of love in a sociopathic future, who knows. I believe that Scott's examination of what it is to be human and to what extent our apathy for human emotions exist, is poignant and very worthy of the praise he has received from many reviewers, however, the futuristic median by which he expresses it folds under the pressure of its own outdated style. It is disheartening to so a movie that has such good intentions be muddled by its sci fi median. Something that is so often the case with 80's era sci fi filmaking. Only movies such as the original Star Wars or Star Trek series have been able to so far stand the test of time without scrutiny, despite lacking the deep philosophical questions raised by a movie such as Blade Runner. As such i'm left deeply conflicted by this movie. I am assured that this movie will not stand as a timeless classic as the next generation of movie goers will find it slow and worthlessly outdated. And yet i hope more movies such as this will be made, ones that examine human complexities and bring them to light but i pray such films are able to do such without relying on technical visual style. Sci Fi is an almost impossible median by which such movies can be made since it seems technology moves so exponentially that things are outdated the second they come into existence. This is the, above all, major problem i have with Scott's movie. Any person under the age of 30 will find it laughably unbelievable and will therefore be less impressed by its message. The movies that are greatest transcend such scrutiny because they let their IDEAS exist at the forefront, not technology. As such i believe that if i were older, or seeing Blade Runner when it was initially released i would be much more impressed with it. But given that i cannot cling to nostalgia to alter my views of an obviously flawed movie i am left with a muddled, over the top, 80's style sci fi film, that has the greatest of messages wrapped in the most absurd of packaging. If you are under 30, no matter how mature or intellectual you are, i'd steer completely clear of this movie, it will bore you and make you apathetic to its complexities.", "rating": 5, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 5}, "heading": "Fairness guaranteed", "date": "2006-08-19T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1452220"}, {"content": "In this cult favorite, a detective tracks down dangerous replicants in a dark, seedy Los Angelos of the future.

Some of the choices were not so surprising (Edward Scissorhands, Fred Tate). Others were somewhat odd (RoboCop, Khan Noonien Singh). But the characters who shared the top place are all from this film. Not so coincidentally, they are all Replicants. In the midst of a propaganda war with normalist organisations such as Cure Autism Now that want you to believe being on the autistic spectrum automatically makes one of no worth to society, Blade Runner elegantly sums up what life is really like for those of us on the higher end of said spectrum. You know, those of us who build tomorrow's computers or paint tomorrow's masterpieces, just to name a few things. The thing that catapults Blade Runner into such brilliance that it should be preserved as an example of Western culture at its very greatest is that this relevance is completely accidental.The story is as simple as it is shocking. Although 2019 is fast approaching, and the floating car or human machine is still a fantasy, what is important to understand is that in a world of equal poverty and despair, mankind has created the new underclass. Terrified by the fact that these artificial humans are their equals in intelligence and their superiors in physical strength, humanity creates a new police force with the sole purpose of hunting this new underclass. Treated as if they are mere property, or pets that have gone bad, members of this new slave underclass come to Earth seeking the ability to extend their lives. As the plot summary on the Region 4 DVD says, their only crime is wanting to be human. Although the film only gives vague hints of this, these poor creatures are pretty much birthed and then thrown into a life of slavery without so much as a pause. If mankind can rise to the level of his betters, then he will do his damnedest to drag his betters down to his level.To be fair, Blade Runner does take its time to develop its story, and a lengthy attention span is required to get the most out of it. In contrast to many films made around the same time or in the subsequent years, it is designed to reward the intellect of its audience rather than their conformity. With a third and ostensibly final cut of the film on its way, there is already some minor debate over which of the two previous editions is the better one. For my money, the director's cut wins every time. The voiceovers of the theatrical release are obnoxious and insulting to the intelligence of the viewer. The happy ending robs the film of its final-note impact. And without Deckard's dreams of unicorns or his developing romance with Rachael, much of the meaning of the story is lost. Like tears in the rain. This is a supreme irony, as the so-called director's cut of Blade Runner is one of the few \"special editions\" that is shorter than the original release. Which goes to prove the old adage that the executives who sit in board rooms and make decisions all day just do not know how to properly put together films.Acting performances just do not get any better than this, either. Rutger Hauer is absolutely chilling, and yet charming, as Roy Batty, the self-appointed leader of the latest bunch of rebel Replicants to make it Earthside. After monumental performances in such Dutch-language classics as Turks Fruit or Soldaat Van Oranje, Hauer rises to his apex here, and proves that in any film, a protagonist is only as good as his antagonist. Harrison Ford plays it cool and understated for the most part, making sure the audience understands his character is totally unaware that his world is about to be rocked to its foundations. The surprise factor of the final moment is as much due to his performance as a clever script. Sean Young briefly demonstrates she could have been a serious actor as the most unusual kind of love interest, and the support cast is far from shabby here, either. Joe Turkel is especially creepy as Eldon Tyrell, the ringmaster of what seems to have turned into one painfully oppressive circus. The character truly thinks nothing of creating an entire life with only one purpose in mind, and Turkel sells the fact like ice cream in a heatwave.The dystopian vision of what is now a very near future also resonates in the present. As we spin through a grimy Los Angeles, we no longer have any idea who owns what, and corporate imagery is pervasive enough to feel like an eye in every corner. Product placement can be annoying in films where it is done blatantly or without any real purpose, but in Blade Runner, the placement of corporate logos gives the scenery both a reality and an artistry rarely seen elsewhere. I do not know how much TDK paid to have their logo displayed during Batty's rooftop battle with Deckard, but the imagery alone was worth every penny, and then some. In Blade Runner, TDK really does amazing things on one's system. But all this pales in comparison to the vision itself. Watching this film in Pan & Scan is akin to blinding yourself in one eye. It is like watching a waterfall through a keyhole when you could just push the door open and see a wide, rolling vista. Nobody has ever used the 2.35:1 frame as well as Sergio Leone, but Ridley Scott gave it a very good try when he shot Blade Runner.It is for these reasons, and many more, that I gave Blade Runner a ten out of ten.

The story of one Rick Deckard, a bounty hunter out to eliminate a handful of renegade replicants (i. e. androids), and how he fell in love with one of them, was adapted from Philip K. Dick's short story \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" and is extremely claustrophobic. One would never know that this was Los Angeles; the sun never shines, colors are muted, and there is an element of sick-green corruption all around. Stylistically it moves at a steady pace, never pausing for cute moments. Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Brion James, Sean Young, and Joanna Cassidy are quite impressive in their renditions of the replicants -- particularly Hauer and Hannah who have some truly memorable sequences of extremely disquieting violence, violence that is a reaction to their one dream, which is to live. One poignant sequence involves Harrison Ford explaining to Sean Young that her memories were implanted to her and thus, are not real. I thought that was the cruelest part of the movie, because it was like telling your own creation that he or she did not have a \"life\" until you gave it to them, and somehow that carries an undertone of inhumanity about it. There has been the speculation, by the way, that Ford's character could also be a replicant, but somehow that doesn't seem to be the case in the movie: he's just a cop with a mission to complete. That he decides to spare Rachael's \"life\" shows a human aspect about him -- that he wasn't all orders, even when the romance in itself is perfunctory to say the least.

One could say that Ridley Scott is more respectful of the future that he is of the past. I only know the film from the director's cut and I find it a perfect film...Here are a few things I like about this film that have rarely been duplicated in another sci-fi film and were never again put together with the same care:* believable dialogue that is spare and to the point and gives away just enough information to keep things on the \"noir\" side and for the viewer to imagine the rest - dialogue that becomes poetry by Lautr\u00e9amont in the mouth of Rutger Hauer; * a plausible and evocative atmosphere composed of set design, lighting, photography and special effects that really gel together, combining attention to detail with sweep and scope; * acting, casting and faces that help the telling of the story (Hauer is the definitive hero of the 21st millennium, a Christ figure and a much better and more complex man than anybody else in the film); * music (by Vangelis) that provides both space-age lounge music, psychological density and the kind of eeriness that was formerly Nino Rota's unassailed trademark.It is an action movie that opens a whole new can of philosophical worms towards the end when the humanity of the enslaved replicant is demonstrated and the hero's motives and his own humanity are questioned.

Whereas ALIEN was a totally visceral thrill ride, BLADE RUNNER is a much more subdued, cerebral offering. Nominally based on Phillip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, BLADE RUNNER is perhaps best described as futuristic film noir. Although the film is set in the year 2019, and features a vast array of technical marvels, the film's depiction of Los Angels is not drastically different than the world of today, at least in terms of the humanoids that inhabit it.The cast is a seemingly odd assortment of actors, but they come together as a surprisingly effective ensemble. Harrison Ford was born to be a sci-fi film star as his aloof, tough guy personae never caves under the extravagance of massive production design or heavy special effects. Rutger Hauer and Sean Young give haunting, compelling performances as two replicants who want more, and William Sanderson turns in an endearing portrayal of a perpetual child of sorts. Edward James Olmos, Joanna Cassidy, M. Emmett Walsh, and then-newcomer Daryl Hannah all deliver striking supporting performances that linger on in the memory of the viewer long after the film has ended.Although justifiably considered a film classic today, BLADE RUNNER was surprisingly a box office failure at the time of its release, seemingly misunderstood by an audience who were expecting the more straightforward thrills and chills of Scott's ALIEN. It seems as if the majority of the film-going public simply was not ready for a sci-fi adventure that was as literate and thought-provoking as this film. Artistic justice was served in 1992 when Warner Brothers allowed Scott to release a \"Director's Cut\" version of BLADE RUNNER, which presents the film in the manner in which Scott originally intended it to be released. The \"Director's Cut\" wisely drops the studio-mandated narration and the tacked-on \"happy\" ending, and was almost immediately embraced as further improvement on this classic film by the majority of viewers.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Stunning futuristic film noir", "date": "2006-05-25T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1376814"}, {"content": "Well, I guess I must have totally missed the point again... I did not see a Sci-Fi masterpiece with astonishingly progressive visual effects and a flawlessly adapted screenplay, but an over-ambitious and difficult to digest drama epic with a lack of action. But hey, \"Blade Runner\" is ranked pretty high in the IMDb top 250 and all the professional reviews are singing praise, so my humble opinion is probably something you shouldn't bother to read. Although, for the record, the only version I've seen is the original theatrical version and \u0096 supposedly \u0096 only the 1992 director's cut version is a genuine masterpiece. Unquestionably terrific is Ridley Scott's portrayal of our world by the year 2019, when the cities look exactly like predicted in Fritz Lang's \"Metropolis\" with immense 300-storey skyscrapers and pure decay down below on the streets. The future is ugly and petrifying and it looks like nobody can smile anymore. In this sad and unappealing universe, Rick Deckard is an early retired \"Blade Runner\" whose duty was to eliminate android fugitives, called Replicants, that escaped from extraterrestrial colonies. Deckard is called back because four of the most dangerous Replicants are on an earthly mission to increase their miserable life-span of only four years. The film's biggest disappointment \u0096 other than the tiresome voice over by Ford and the dreadful jazzy soundtrack \u0096 are the characterizations of these android Replicants. Supposedly they're relentless villains that already made over 30 casualties on their way over to earth, yet when they're face to face with their enemies \u0096 humans \u0096 they don't look the least bit menacing or dangerous at all! Neither do they evoke feeling of understanding or sympathy, they just behave like philosophical talkers; especially the \"leader\" Roy Batty. The love-story sequences between Ford and robotic beauty Sean Young feel like pure melodramatic padding whereas sublime actors in intriguing supportive roles (M.

It is courageous as well as spirited, seminal and prophetic. Probably, This is the reason why BR (especially the end) was 1982 so deformed by the producers. I was 14 years old when it was released in Germany. I could only watch it through the eyes of a boy that was on the verge of getting an adolescent. Thanks to the corresponding zeitgeist of the 80's with it's unmatched mixture of fascination and fear of the future, it was an admirable work and a thunderclap that nearly produced an overflow of fascination in a young boy's synapsis. But I got a wonderful glimpse and now an assuredness that I was a witness to something singular. The beginning shows a central theme of the film. An apocalyptic skyline with gigantic fires mirrors in the eyes of a man. The eyes are the window to the soul of a human and they are used to separate the humans from the non humans, that means the replicants. The replicants are used for dangerous slave works in the outer worlds. No more. The interesting thing is that they are much more intelligent,strong and fit than even the engineers who constructed them. But whenever they try to come back to the earth, they will be killed, euphemistically called \"retired\". People, who do this job, are called \"Blade Runner\". Deckard, the main character of the film, is one of them and his name is no accident. Deckard refers to Descartes, the french philosopher and founder of the modern philosophy, who's known for his insight that self awareness is the basis for existence. At the beginning Deckard is confident about the role all beings play. But he's that only because he doesn't question anything. He lives his life, and that's it. His new job changes everything. Bryant, his last boss, \"motivates\" him to \"retire\" four \"skin-jobs\", i.e. replicants. So he starts as usual. At first he has to show the machine for revealing non humans to Eldon Tyrell, the genuine diabolic chief of the Tyrell corporation, who invented and \"produces\" the newest generation of replicants, called Nexus 6. Deckard demonstrates his machine on Rachel. Questions are asked to provoke an emotional reaction in the test object. Replicants can't deal with it. Tyrell advanced his replicants, but the machine works even with them. One of the two weaknesses of them. The other is the lifespan of 4 years. As Rachel starts to get aware of what she is, Deckard is grievously untouched. Tyrell regards and realizes all. As the Owl he owns, the symbol for wisdom. The first impression of Roy Batty, the leader of the replicants, who came back to earth for a special reason, is symptomatic for the rest of the movie. He's unapproachable for the humans he visits. Deckard does his job as usual with Salom\u00e9, the name of a bible character. In the meantime, as Roy Betty visits his maker, Eldon Tyrell, the \"god\" of Bio-Genetics. Roy wanted to bid his \"father\" to give him more time to live. But all Tyrell can do is to summarize Roy's life in two sentences. \"The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long. And you have burned so very very brightly Roy.\" Then the son kills his father. Nitsche's greeting. Then, Rachel shows Deckard photos of her youth to get a confirmation for her last hope to be human, but he destroys all her illusions. She weeps - one of the most human emotions. Deckard recognizes what he's done and wants to console her, but is merely implausible. That's the point when Deckard gets real doubts, because he can't handle real emotions himself. But he carries on. In the end he is confronted with Roy Betty, who sees his lifetime fading away. Therefore he drills a nail through his hand to feel life through pain. That reminds of Jesus which is again no accident. In the end Deckard is eyeball to eyeball with his own death. Roy stands beside and confronts him with the only feeling he experienced himself: fear. \"Quite an experience to life in fear, isn't it ?\" and then... Roy saves him with his pierced hand, holding a dove, the symbol for the soul, in the other. His last words in view of his nearing death are ultimately sad and wonderful at the same time: \"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe.......All those moments will be lost in time. Like tears in the rain. Time to die.\" Then his dove rises. What a statement ? He tells his innermost memories, which were not implanted and will be lost when he dies. He realizes that the meaning of life is to live. He accepted his ending existence as Roy Batty. That gave him salvation and he could die being one with the world. There he reminds again to Jesus. He learned his lesson, and that makes him really \"more human than human\". Actually, the Nexus 6 are the only ones, who shine in a dark world of steady rain and curious people. The end gives a hint on Deckard's reality as he finds an origami, which symbolizes a unicorn. It's from Gaff, the mysterious figure, who follows Deckard through the whole movie. Deckard nods his head as if he knows. It was the final scene of the better version. No questions anymore. The movie makes a mountainous statement of what makes a human human. The conclusion can only be the self awareness and the affirmation of life. And it was the end of a gigantic and singular movie which You should have seen. A comment will never live up to the atmosphere BR enfolds You in. Even today, 25 years later, I'm still enchanted.

The reason for it is because after every time I watch a great sci-fi film, it'll always leave me with a new theoretical concept to think about after the movie's over. I'll admire the film-maker's creativity and excellent ideas with these well-built sets.I had very high expectations for Blade Runner, it had an early 80s Harrison Ford and an interesting concept that I read from a few brief plot summaries. Unfortunately for me, this was the most disappointing film that I've ever seen.The film's main plot is that there are \"Replicants\", clones that were in off-world colonies (now illegal after a mutiny), that land in a very dark futuristic version of Los Angeles. Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a Blade Runner, his job is to kill or \"retire\" these six Replicants. Rutger Hauer plays Roy Batty, the leader of the Replicants that landed on Earth. The feel of the film is a very dark, a gloomy vision of the future.I loved Harrison Ford's performance as Indiana Jones and Han Solo is one of my favourite movie characters of all-time but he didn't display any of his acting talent in Blade Runner. He doesn't show any emotions at all and he was just annoying. The rest of the cast wasn't any better except for Rutger Hauer. I liked the way he spoke in this film and his speech at the end was great (I won't deny that).Another of my major complaints is that the pacing of the film is so unnecessarily slow. It just lagged on, it felt as it was three and half hours long when it was just over two hours. They are so many scenes that could've been cut, especially the numerous montages of Deckard driving through the city.The film is not all bad though. The sets are very original and the cinematography really stands out. The score is great, I really loved the music at the ending credits that gave it a science fiction feel.Overall, I really hated this film. There is a lot of aspects of it that I just despised but I do praise all the work that was done to build all these amazing sets. The ending to me, didn't make any sense at all and the bad acting made me stop caring about the characters. Also, the slow pacing just made the film completely uninteresting.

Internal in that Harrison Ford, the best of the best in replicant executioners still struggles with that fact that he kills. It doesn't matter that what he kills isn't really human, he still feels his own humanity as he does the awful deed of ending a replicant's life.It's revealed to us early on who these replicants are but amazingly we don't find out their reason for escaping their assigned occupations. In a very crafty fashion their mission reveals itself in the people they are looking for. More life, the wish of everyone, is their only true goal.Outside of the movies plot, there are two things that stand out with Bladerunner. The first is that this movie's atmosphere as put forth by special effects and set designs stand up with the best out there today. They blend together in such as way as to elicit that eery aura we all feel sans The Day the Earth Stood Still.But the one thing that stands out and has always stood out is the absolute perfection of Sean Young in make-up. To this day I've never seen a more beautifully scuptured face with absolute perfection in her coloring and features. She's made up in such a way that she literally pounces out of the screen. She has never received the credit she deserved for this film and it's a shame because no character in any science fiction movie has put forth a more perfect performance than her.Rutger Hauer of course provides us with a performance that was worthy of a best supporting actor Oscar and had this come out today he would have gotten it.Daryl Hannah, perhaps the weakest link in the cast still puts forth an acceptable performance as one of the replicants. It would have been a lesser movie without her.The filming of facial expression, the interaction between all the characters and the final scenes which actually promote full circle motivations is fascinating.I've spun Bladerunner on the platter a good 20 times since watching it again in 2000 and I must say, I never get tired of it because it's difficult not to appreciate a masterpiece.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Incredible in more ways than one", "date": "2006-02-18T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1295176"}, {"content": "I found the movie bizarre and hard to follow.

Most, like the special effects of the fifties, have in some way or another been out- done, forgotten or indeed re- made. None of these are ways in which 1982's Blade Runner has been affected by the test of time. If anything, Blade Runner has got better and better as time has passed since its release, and is now regarded as something of a lost gem of the otherwise bad decade of film- making, the eighties. The charm of this futuristic and deeply provocative science fiction film was much hated by audiences upon its release, and it is very difficult to see why. Douglas Trumbull's lushly dark and upsetting skylines and cityscapes are still as imposingly sinister as ever it was, and the man vs. machine storyline is perhaps the only sci- fi narrative that stays intact as a result. The sheer originality of the film, not succumbing to the confines of some more run- of \u0096the- mill narratives, is a depiction of film- making at its brilliant best, with the film noir influence painting a bleak image of a dystopian future world. So, if all these points about the film are true, then why was this film not more of a success? I believe it has very much to do with the presence of Star Wars still floating around, even five years after its release. Audiences were won over by the intergalactic battle between good and evil and idolised the role of Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, and indeed Darth Vader, the demonic leader of the dark side of the force. Quite rightfully so, as Star Wars in 1977 was definitely ahead of its time in terms of special effects and sheer scale, but here is where I get controversial. Blade Runner is better. It has all the charm and intelligence of Star Wars, and then some. The special effects are sublime and involving, and the story is way more complex and meaningful than Star Wars or indeed any other sci-fi film of the era. The beauty of Blade Runner is everywhere, from the meaningful and emotionally provocative script, the excellent acting and the dazzling special effects, to the way the film communicates with the audience on a much higher level than most films ever could. The sheer beauty of this film is not noticeable unless the viewer engages and understands just what the film is trying to tell them. Blade Runner is a very clever film in that it prophesises what the future could hold for mankind. If that is not a scary thought, given the content of the film, I don't know what is. Later next year, Blade Runner gets it's long awaited and indeed welcomed release on DVD, to celebrate the films' 25th anniversary, and I feel that for once, the film will get the attention and public welcome that it deserved upon it's release over two decades ago. Of course the film will have critics swarming over it, ready to pick any fault they can, but I think somehow that it was never intended to be that sort of film at all. It is a film that just needs to be heard as it gets its message across. I really feel that if people really listened on its release, we could now be talking about Blade Runner in a very different way. Maybe even with the same status as Star Wars has. But, I guess that it is down to public opinion, and preference, but surely that should not overshadow one of the great marvels of sci-fi? The debate about Blade Runner continues, with critics constantly mulling it over, reconsidering its status even twenty four years after it first graced our screens. But I think that this film will never be forgotten. Undoubtedly the best work to come from Ridley Scott yet, and a truly provocative and moving film, I think Blade Runner will be talked about for many more years to come, and as a result, the charm of it will never die. So remember don't judge a book by its cover. Go and see Blade Runner, and treat yourself to one of the greatest influences on modern cinema and arguably one of the best book to film adaptations you are ever likely to see.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 3}, "heading": "The epitome of sci-fi masterpieces", "date": "2006-01-19T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1269237"}, {"content": "This film is a brilliant attempt to make you feel the existential struggle for personal value in an atheistic world. If your a theist, this movie will remind you why you are not an atheist. If your an atheist, this movie will remind you of the empty and ultimately meaningless life that you live, for \"all those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain\". If you are debating on seeing this film, I would recommend just some basic philosophical articles on nihilism, existentialism and postmodern philosophy. I believe what I posted below will be a good place to start if you want to understand the film.Humanity is represented by Roy throughout the film, especially when Roy kills his creator (Nietzsche's phrase \"God is dead\" is obviously the background for Roy's symbolic act of killing his creator). Also, in the end we find out that Roy, with the nail though his hand and dove at his side, is the nihilistic Christ (the deliberate comparison to Jesus, and the reversal of his divine proclamation of eternal life cannot be missed). This movie not only asked many questions about life and meaning, it actually answers them with Roy's last \"divine\" proclamation. Basically put, if there is no Creator that can give eternal life, there is no longer value and purpose in life because all that we experience is ultimately lost. Thus, to search for true personal value in a life thats turns into nothingness is as pointless as trying to find a tear on a persons face when they are crying in the rain. Roy's failure to have his life extended is the means used to make us feel the sadness and despair that is found in an intelligent being who will soon vanish into nothingness. The intent is to make us look at out own experiences with the same despair, because if there is no God, there is no one to eternally extend our lives. Thus, when you cease to exist, and you must, all your experiences and all the work that came to make you the person you are today will be lost. So to truly understand this movie and feel its impact, you have to put yourself in Roys place, because thats where you are. Roy did not kill Deckard because he wanted him to walk in his shoes and feel what he felt; he wanted to \"enlighten\" him. Thus, we find a purpose in this film; to \"enligten\" its viewers of their own inescapable plight in an atheistic world.Some have said that another purpose of the film is to show that one must make the best of the time that they have. In other words, the point of the movie is that since we must face this horrid outcome of nothingness, then there is nothing to lose in acting as if there is true purpose and meaning in our lives so as to emotionally overcome the despair. I think there is truth to that also, and the emotional act of \"making the best out of the time we have\" was represented by the unicorn in the last scene. Throughout the film, Gaff would make origami figures that represented what was going on in the scene. At the end when Deckard was leaving with Rachel he found a unicorn origami which indicated that his dreams were implanted. At this point one must ask why the writer used a mythical animal in his dream, rather then an animal that really existed? I believe the unicorn was used to describe the act of Deckard \"making the best of things\", or acting as if there is true meaning and value, for such things are just myths (like the unicorn) in an atheistic world. Thus, to act as if such things as unicorns, value and worth were true, one would have to knowingly fool themselves and act as if the unreal is real, which is exactly what Deckard had to do with Rachel, and possibly him self. Where as Roy was not willing or was unable to entertain such emotionally driven human delusions, Deckard was and therefore joined humanity. \"GOD IS DEAD\" From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia: God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall we, murderers of all murderers, console ourselves? That which was the holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet possessed has bled to death under our knives. Who will wipe this blood off us? With what water could we purify ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we need to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we not ourselves become gods simply to be worthy of it? - Nietzsche, The Gay Science\" \"EXISTENTIALISM\" From Wikipedia,the free encyclopedia.\"Books such as DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP, by Philip K. Dick, and Toilet: The Novel, by Michael Szymczyk all distort the line between reality and appearance while simultaneously espousing strong existential themes.\"\"much postmodern writing is existential--unsurprising, since postmodernism evolved from the thought of NIETZSCHE and Heidegger\"\"Existentialism is a philosophical movement that views human existence as having a set of underlying themes and characteristics, such as anxiety, dread, freedom, awareness of death, and consciousness of existing, that are primary.\"", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "God Is Dead", "date": "2006-01-18T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1269048"}, {"content": "Ridley Scott's 1982 film of Philip K.

It's ambient and evocative score by Italian composer Vangelis, its amazing set design and nostalgia inducing atmosphere.Plagued by production troubles since its inception, and a box office failure Blade Runner would be rediscovered on the video market over the years after a chance screening of a work-print cut in Colorado and evolve into a cult hit, and one of the most influential science-fiction film of all-time. The resurrection as also sparked with the release of the 1992 \"Director's Cut\" which was by all accounts a \"rush job\". The version omitted the drowsy voice-over narration by Harrison Ford and the out-of-place, and studio enforced happy ending.In 2007, The Final Cut arrived and with it closure to the classic film's troubled history as Director, Ridley Scott's vision has finally been realized twenty-five years after the film's initial theatrical release. Whichever version you choose whether it be the Theatrical, Directors Cut, Work-print, European, or the Final Cut Blade Runner is a science fiction masterpiece.On a personal level it makes me feel lost and long for something more, it makes me long for \"time and place that never really was\" and no other film has stayed with me quite like Blade Runner.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 3}, "heading": "A Masterpiece", "date": "2005-12-26T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1247372"}, {"content": "I've seen thousands of movies but Blade Runner is my favorite, my No. 1 movie ever.

Weaving the threads of each theme in a plot together to form a composite whole is what a voice over does.Ultimately the play between good and evil for a cop/detective/centurion is a timeless story about individual response to evils of socially engineered injustice (intended or unintentional).I would like to see a re-release of the movie with the original voice over.

Also, perhaps I'm not even entitled to write this review because I could only stand to watch the first hour of the movie before deciding to turn it off. Unbelievable? Let me explain why. This movie is perhaps one of the most touted films of all time and I had not seen it despite the movie having been around for over 20 years. So, one day, I finally decided to watch the thing and bore patiently through each boring scene after another. I'm a fan of science fiction but now I realize not in the sense of a connoisseur but just a guy who likes a good blend of action, drama, science, fiction and acting. This movie arguably has all of those things but is achingly slow in presenting them. It cannot escape looking every bit like a 1982 vision of what the future would be like and suffers too much from being implemented from an arty angle. The scenes are too dark for Harrison Ford's charms (he could easily have been replaced with someone else who didn't have Indiana Jones behind him) and the characters are much too deep to bother even trying to understand. The philosophical angle doesn't impress me either. There are many 'big questions' movies can deal with without making the audience itself lie on the couch. I suppose the last 40 minutes or so of the film might have been better and tied up some loose ends but I could not stand to waste any more time watching it. Looking at other movies from the same era which I still find very interesting - Conan The Barbarian, Indiana Jones and Alien - I'm disappointed to say that Blade Runner could have been better. Anyway, I will shoulder part of the blame because I didn't watch it to the end and perhaps because technology is moving at light speed these days, philosophical science fiction movies really look much, much older than they ought to.

Yes, there have been controversies about the film from the day it was released, be it the arguments between director Ridley Scott and the producers over which version should be shown to the public or rumors about the filming being \"troubled\", but such gossip shouldn't detract from the picture's merits, and there are plenty; in fact, a lot of people consider Blade Runner the best science-fiction movie ever made, and they do have a point - how many sci-fi flicks manage to fuse film noir atmosphere and characters with philosophical doubts on the very nature of mankind?Specifically, the story, based on a novel by Philip K. Dick, is strongly influenced by the theories of Swiss philosopher Ren\u00e9 Descartes, aka Carthesius. One of the main concerns of his line of thought was the difference between men and machines, the main theme of the film: in 2019, replicants used to be part of everyday life, but are now dangerous and must be eliminated. Five of these \"skin-jobs\", however, are still at large in Los Angeles, which is why reluctant \"blade runner\" Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is asked to track them down. But as he gets more and more disillusioned about his work and develops odd feelings for one of the replicants (Sean Young), he begins to wonder: is there really something that sets him apart from the entities he is hunting? Batty and his lover Pris (Daryl Hannah) are trying to answer that question by eliminating the last imperfection that makes them less \"human\" (they only live five years), and Pris even claims to be as normal as any other person by saying: \"I think, therefore I am.\" (another Carthesius-related element). With his first two films (The Duellists and Alien) accused of being more about style and mood than content, Scott combines form and substance in what is widely regarded as his best achievement: the rainy, gloomy L.A. (all real sets, no CGI) sets the tone perfectly for a futuristic noir that renewed the genre by crafting an intelligent, heartfelt and adult story, making Warner Brothers' decision to chuck in a \"happy ending\" (subsequently removed, alongside Deckard's uninspired narration, from the Director's Cut, which is the version I'm reviewing) utterly ridiculous. I mean, how can a movie set in a bleak future where even humanity itself is a debatable topic end on a cheerful note?Speaking of humanity, the film's point is reflected masterfully in the performances: Ford's laconic, apparently cold anti-hero is one of his best characters, and his doomed bond with Young is endearing to this day, but the whole movie is shamelessly stolen by the \"monstrous\" Batty, to whom Hauer gives a scary intensity that makes the doubtful replicant more complex and the Dutch actor's work (the best of his career) more touching, particularly when he remembers all the things that he has seen and will inevitably be \"lost in time\".Dark and unsettling, Blade Runner is a beautiful, nightmarish and fascinating journey in a twisted society. No other sci-fi movie can match this one in terms of impact, both visual and emotional, and after seeing it one might ask himself what it must be like to see \"attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion\" or \"C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser Gate\".", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "This film's moments will never be lost in time, like tears in rain...", "date": "2005-11-09T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1215644"}, {"content": "This is possibly one of the worst films in existence.

All three are represented to some effect (well, maybe not so much horror, though a few moments are spine-tingling) to create the dirty, sulky atmosphere of 2019 Los Angeles, where the rich have gone to live on the off-world colonies and the rest of humanity bubbles and ferments in a disgusting world of industrial sludge and ever-pouring rain, a world now penetrated by four replicants (androids) escaped from the off-world colonies and who must be hunted down by Deckard, a blade runner.Such is the overview of the richly articulated and darkly felt exploration into humanity and creation, where humans have created humans and those humans are aggressors against their creators. Man, beast, and robot are mixed and only divided by social taboos and product numbers, only that doesn't necessarily make the humans much different either considering how literally crushed they are by industry and advertising ever flashing through the streets in neon signs.The story arch follows Deckard as he is forced unwillingly into hunting down the escaped replicants and slowly finds all roles reversed, both of the hunt and of the status. As he falls in love with the replicant Rachel, Deckard is forced to hide her from the very people he works for just as much as he's forced to pass their judgement on people whose only crime is the desire to live. Such poetic exposition is not realized through the human characters; their actions are too mechanic and bland that they nearly seem invisible. It's realized in the replicants, who desire, love, feel, and hurt.This is an awesome and powerful look into what it means to be human and God. Both the stylistic elements and the craftsmanship of this film work together perfectly to create an atmosphere often attempted but never as fully realized in this distinct and important film.

It is thematically deep and stunning to look at and the acting is overall very fine. My problem when writing this review is that I don't know where to begin because the film has so many elements which are all essential in understanding the film and the many symbols used in it. My review is mainly directed towards the director's cut version which in my opinion is the superior one.Harrison Ford plays the main character or the protagonist and he does an excellent job. His character is darker than in both Star Wars and Indiana Jones and it works just as well. Ford delivers every line with confidence and sense of timing and basically produces a well rounded character. The acting isn't all there is to the character, however. If you look at the wardrobe of the character you will find that the long brown coat he wears resembles that of a detective from films in the 30s and 40s. A small thing but it helps define the character and brings some post modernism into the film. The same kind of characterization through wardrobe is used in many places in the film. Rachel (Sean Young) resembles a so-called 'femme fatale' from 30s detective/crime films with her neat hair and dark dresses. Sean Young's acting is impeccable and she delivers a stylized yet effective performance. Rutger Hauer has his (without a doubt) finest performance of his career as the antagonist. He steals every scene and even Harrison Ford has since admitted that he had trouble matching the intensity of Hauer. The supporting cast is good as well so acting wise the film is pretty flawless.The film is visually stunning as well. Every scene is cramped with atmosphere and tension and even today more than 20 years later the film is still a visual feast. There are some who would say that Blade Runner is an example of style over substance and I am almost inclined to agree because the film really is stunning to look at. Ridley Scott's vision of the future is dystopian at best and as the camera pans over the futuristic landscape of Los Angeles you cannot help but feel a sense of dread at how depressing and ugly the world looks and strangely this is a good thing. The fact that the film makes you feel something is a clear cut sign of how brilliant it really is. Scott's ability to make people feel with nothing but images is quite simply awe inspiring. If the thematic enigmas do not spellbind you then at least marvel at the visual accomplishments. Along with the visual style the sound track of the film is also highly innovative and different. The sound definitely helps in creating the mood of the film.As previously stated the film is highly philosophical but every person should watch the film and come to their own conclusion about the film. It would be wrong of me to impose my analysis and conclusions upon future viewers because you should definitely see this film with an open mind and you should definitely see it at least twice so as to get all the nuances of the film. Suffice to say there is enough thematic material (including quite a few bible references) to keep a philosophical conversation going for quite some time. If you don't believe me check the film out and find out for yourself.Blade Runner stands for me as Ridley Scott's finest hour. The film has everything needed to become a classic and it delivers in both style and substance. A deep involving story, a great cast, fabulous visual elements and above all the film makes you think and it raises some interesting (and relevant) issues.

Bladerunner, spearheaded by Harrison Ford (Rick Deckard) and Rutger Hauer (Roy Batty), delivers both cinematically, with its designer sets and innovative clothing, to its script and acting quality. Based on Philip K. Dick's book, \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\", Bladerunner has surpassed beyond what an ideal film is. Often times, for instance, there is double meanings in scenes, that run as deep as the cosmos.For its visuals alone, it has ingrained itself in history when sci-fi was coming into CGI. CGI, unfortunately, pales hopelessly, even today, in comparison to yesterday's Hollywood models. From the cars to the streets to the VidPhon, the future is so well depicted that nothing has challenged it before neither after. Demolition Man with Sylvestor Stallone was formidable, but it fails in so many other respects that it should not even be considered as a challenge.Entering Bladerunner, it explores what it means to be a human, and, how important emotions are in shaping who we are. It also exploits other, complex philosophical issues, as Deckard tries to understand \"what\" he is and whether anything is, in fact, \"real.\" Sounds like the Matrix, except the correct clause would be: The Matrix sounds like Bladerunner, with the addition of the Matrix being a gross misinterpretation. While the Matrix provides us with a possibility of what reality is, Bladerunner is less ambitious, focusing on and questioning what memories are, how they shape us, and what our \"reality\" means in relation.It questions our morals; our history; our identities; our entire logically constructed world. As we have a myriad of qualities in common with the Replicants, they only live for 4 years. It teaches us about the importance of understanding, or, at least attempting to understand, life's nature and what that means to ones personal subsistence. With only 4 years to live a life span, the Replicants show us that they have the ability to get wise quickly, rather than the situation with humans: growing old so fast but wise so slow.Philosophically, this film is significantly accurate. The scene where Batty meets his maker, Tyrell, is compelling and is one of the best scenes in film history.

BR's DC is a rare example for a film that seems to be better understood by the producers than the director in terms of viewer's needs. It's not only because I'm used to the original version of Blade Runner that I think Ridley Scott made a mistake with the new version. Ford's off voice may not be essential, but for first time \"Blade Runner's\" it is helpful for understanding what the film is about without explaining too much. I think director and fans tend to forget that. In my opinion The additional scenes are needless and annoying. The scenes totally destroy the pleasure of discovering all the subtle hints for Deckard may being a replicant that can be found in the original version. I prefer to think by myself rather than being hit with the filmmakers message. It is an example of a trend in Hollywood's film-making: explain everything only to be sure that even the last one gets the message. Some things are much more striking and of course more interesting if not said explicitly - but for that you need a little more faith in your audience. It's too bad that Scott lost that with the DC.

Hardcore science fiction fans will instantly recognize that the city's spectacular highrises reference Fritz Lang's silent METROPOLIS; art history buffs should notice a distinct Frank Lloyd Wright tinge to some of the set designs; costume designs are clearly intended to evoke the spirit of 1940s film noir. The resulting melange is simply extraordinary, very powerful, and incredibly atmospheric.The cast gives able, stylish performances in keeping with the film's dark but glossy tone, but the script they play is a very muddy one. The story concerns a special agent (Harrison) who is assigned the task of locating and \"retiring\" (i.e. killing) a handful of violent androids who have illegally landed on earth. While I greatly admire the film's decidedly \"open-ended\" conclusion, I do not greatly admire the on-going vagueness that besets the storyline as a whole.We are persistently asked to ask believe that Harrison Ford locates his quarry via the vaguest information imaginable; moreover, although specifically described as a highly experienced and formidable agent, Ford's character gives little evidence of it: he's always being bashed around to the point of death and then overcoming his opponent more through dumb luck than superior skill. Most annoying of all, the film flirts with issues concerning creation of artificial life without actually amplifying any of them in a consistently engaging way.In spite of these failings, the performances and most particularly the incredibly compelling make BLADE RUNNER a fantastic triumph of style over substance. It is extremely enjoyable, and it is easy to understand how the film has drawn so many enthusiastic fans.The DVD presently available is a \"director's cut\" version and offers both widescreen and modified-for-television formats. The former is recommended, for the latter undercuts the visual fascination of the film. The picture quality of the widescreen format is superior; the sound is good but not exceptional.

The film felt a little empty to me. Harrison Ford is to be one of the greatest actors alive who did such amazing movies like Star Wars and The Fugitive, had a wooden performance like a children's toy. I found him to be quite a boring character of Blade Runner. The movie was very dark and the film was just too serious. I also thought the film was bizarre and had tons of weird moments, but I guess that I have to watch the film twice to understand all of it instead of most of it. The positive side is that the film was very stylish and had a lot of cool inventions and nice scenery for a 80's film. But the best side of Blade Runner was Rutger Haurer who really carried the movie as the creepy replicant. He did a fantastic job.

It is a movie that makes you think and it is made by thinking individuals. It tells you not to trust the surface, and this is always a bold thing to do for a movie - given that it is, by definition, composed of surface only.The cast is perfect, Rudger Hauer as the leader of a group of \"replicants\" (androids) and Harrison Ford as \"blade runner\" Rick Deckard, charged to hunt them down, above all others.Daryl Hannah really is her part - a desperate replicant, while Sean Young as Rachael, the female attraction for Harrison Ford played her extremely interesting role well enough, but is still the weakest link in the chain in my opinion. Ford has subsequently played many inferior roles in movies. In this one he is the right character and he's - ever trying to be sure of himself, while being corroded by doubts - brilliant.What's also special about the movie is the atmosphere. Ridley Scott didn't get to use computer generated special effects back in 1982. Flying cars were not easily put on celluloid. Don't expect an orgy of special effects, that's not the focus of this movie. There is a lot of action going on but it focuses on people, not explosions. In spite of some minor logical glitches Scott manages to compose a credible scenario, a sinister vision of a might-be-future with a few subtle flashes of dark humor. On a side note: you might want to stock up on umbrellas before 2019, according to Ridley Scott we are in for rain.Of course the movie would not rank among the best movies without the soundtrack by Vangelis, which is a masterpiece by itself. Together photography and music form something exceptional.Unlike with many inferior sci-fi movies, there is more to \"Blade Runner\" than just atmosphere, special effects and a great sound track. The movie makes you think about some of the big philosophical questions concerning the individual as well as society. What is life? What's special about humans? Why is one life worth more than another? How shall we deal with death? And what's the role of society in all of this?The movie - especially the director's cut - does not try to answer or appease in the end. All it tells us is that we can't get away from these questions, no matter where we go, be it to an \"off-world colony\" or just \"north\".\"Blade Runner\" is the best film of its kind and one of the best I know overall.

Blade Runner (either version) stands the test of time as an epic story which transcends a disparity of genres, as well as the seminal \"dark\" sci-fi film which has been mimicked so frequently (to varying degrees of success) since its original release. The interplay of film noir, sci-fi, and what is one of the most philosophically symbolic and academically analyzed narratives of the modern era holds its ground on both visual and cerebral levels even in the face of today's CGI laden blockbusters. The new director's cut, contrary to many cinematic re-hashings, actually serves to clarify many of the more nebulous aspects of the plot and makes a great film even better, arguably allowing it to be modernized and polished for a new generation of viewers who are more picky and yet simultaneously less idealistic. All while sustaining the feeling and flavor of the original. Call it restorative work if you will. The tinny and meandering score by Vangelis is pure 1980s at its most brooding and fits the texture and mood of the film beautifully.

Dick, this futuristic urban Sci-Fi film is a masterpiece indeed. Director Ridley Scott has managed to turn Dick's story into a dark and complex film-noir styled mystery, that packs as much punch on an aesthetic level as it does on an emotional and substantial one. It's clear throughout the film that the movie makers' intentions was to make this more of an intelligent character study cum thought-provoking drama rather than the thrill seeking movie that the Sci-Fi genre movies usually are. This is shown by the way that the action in the movie is kept down to a bare minimum, and the way that the film always seems to want to put forward an idea rather than an action sequence. The plot, which covers themes such as what it takes to be considered alive, follows a group of four androids (\"Replicants\") that have escaped their masters and come to Earth, where Replicants are illegal. Their intention is to seek out 'the maker' and try to add to their maximum four-year lifespan, given to them to ensure that they wont have sufficient time to develop emotions. On their tail is Deckard; a policeman in the business of hunting Replicants; known as a Blade Runner.Through a grim setting and dark characterization; Ridley Scott has truly succeeded in giving Blade Runner a classic film-noir style. This bodes well with the futuristic metropolitan version of Los Angeles that the film takes place in. Both of these elements blend excellently with the characters, which are intriguing as they are dark. Harrison Ford steps into the role of Deckard; the classic noir protagonist. We never really delve into his character; but at the same time, that ensures that the mystery surrounding him is kept up, which serves in making our protagonist all the more intriguing. Rutger Hauer, who gives a career-best performance as the leader of the Replicants, matches him. Hauer treads the line between pathos and pure evil brilliantly, and it's always easy to believe that he is the doomed android that the movie presents him as. The main thing I love about this movie is it's style; the dark Gothic undertones are superb to look at, and once the film enters it's final third, the atmosphere takes over and the way that it builds to it's beautiful and classic conclusion is absolutely superb.

Breaking with obvious tradition, I would say NOT, and go as far as to suggest that many reviewers are TOO eager with their praise due to the film's solid cult status which was delivered through ground breaking visual effects.Some may even feel they HAVE to applaud Blade Runner, because to do anything else might cause frenzied bleating within the flock. Lets be clear about this, the gap between cult status and classical status should, and is, as wide as the gaps in this film.Yes, for 1982 the film had superb, even pioneering photography and visual effects. But so did The Matrix. A truly excellent film has to deliver much more than that. For me anyway. I'm talking about taking the audience on a journey, a common experience that relates a well told story to the viewer. Blade Runner's story telling is confusing at best and at worst, borders on pure laziness.While the external photography is way ahead of its time, the internal sets are in the main, a blur of darkness where the director takes little time to define any detail whatsoever. The storyline/plot is left SO open to interpretation, that any significant meaning remains undelivered.Perhaps Scott's numerous arguments with his studio-masters were the root cause of this. His vision of the story clashed with the studio's and many compromises ensued, probably damaging the story and maybe even stalling production time so much that this mess of a film was released prematurely.Yes, the Director's cut (1991) is marginally better, but that was 9 years later, and re-shoots were not an option.

I like shows like (the original) Star Wars trilogy, (most of) the Star Trek films, as well as Star Trek TV series (Voyager for modern times,preferably, as it had the least number of useless episodes), etc. In my experience, most SF material turns out to be distilled garbage. Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' was a masterpiece. I am not hesitant to say that I blatantly dislike Spielberg's definition of SF- ET, Close Encounters, & (worst of all) War Of The Worlds. Neither do I appreciate any 'Alien' film apart from R Scott's 1979 original (although Alien2 was OK)-Alien vs Pred is a disgrace not only to all genres, but to the film industry itself. So when I heard of Blade Runner on the net, I wondered; what could be so good about this film? I have HBO,Cinemax, Star Movies- yet this film has never been shown. So, I got myself the Director's Cut at the local video store. I watched it once. Then I re-watched it two days later. My verdict: This film is fantastic.It is one of the greatest films ever made, on par with 2001: A Space Odyssey. Upon 1st viewing, new audiences may be bewildered. One anticipates a futuristic run-of-the-mill 80's shoot-em-up (in the like of Outland,say). What you get is a film so deep that it is difficult to grasp the 1st time. There is so much symbolism, introverts and questions that I was left stunned. The film is hauntingly beautiful, and I doubt that these screen landscapes could be reproduced today as well as they were here. The plot centres around the question of humanity- something we take for granted. It is not an auctioneer, which was probably what audiences expected when they walked into theatres in the 80s, causing the film to fail commercially. Blade Runner is not for the adrenaline junkie, nor for those who like flashy gadgets and bright explosions, with a healthy Hollywood-made dose of convincing storyline spoon-fed for their satisfaction.The film is set in the apocalyptic, suggestively post-war future Earth, where there seems to be a lag in technology. Perhaps there was a war which ravaged the world, forcing humans to migrate (the cramped cultural richness of LA), and rebuild, explaining the retro technology. 6 'Criminal' Nexus 6 replicates (genetically engineered humanoids), hijack a ship and come to Earth seeking their maker. These slaves(machines/automatons// regard them as anything which has been created by Man to lessen his burden) have developed emotions, and they fear death for they cherish their memories (Think robots weeping over photographs). Their cause: They want a longer life, they want to experience more, they want to be... human.Enter Rick Deckard, Blade Runner. His job: kill trespassing replicates; Kill living, breathing humanoids composed of flesh and blood who only have 4 years to live out their miserable lives, seeking haven on Earth rather than serving as slaves in mining outposts on Mars. Kill? Murder seems more appropriate. But that's his job. replicates which trespass are a hazard. These 6 replicates have killed 23 people and hijacked a ship. They have to be killed, right? If you're planning to take sides in this film, you will be pleasantly if not unnervingly surprised. There are no sides. There is no good and evil. Harrison Ford plays the reluctant, burned out Blade Runner very well. His character is drab and dull, as it was meant to be; look at him in the Spinner on the way to Tyrell corporation- pure boredom. He hates his job. If there were any narration, it Should sound dull and uninteresting, reflecting his character. Rutger Hauer gives the greatest performance of his career (so far) in this film, playing Roy Batty, Replicant 'project manager'. He dominates the later part of the film. He is cold, stiff and evil, but in the end speech, one of the Greatest endings I have ever seen, his performance alone makes this film a Classic. The ending is beautiful, and the score by Vangelis is perfect.All in all, the film is excellent. Well directed by Ridley Scott, innovative and stunning imagery underlined by Vangelis' superb score, and plenty to think about (on your own- no spoon feeding). Check out the trivia for this film; scientists voted it better than 2001:A Space Odyssey. Is the quest for humanity a crime? Find out for yourself.

Dick, directed by Ridley Scott (Alien, Thelma & Louise, Gladiator). Basically in Los Angeles in 2019, artificial humans were bioengineered some time ago, these are known as \"replicants\", but after a bloody mutiny on an Off-World Colony \"replicants\" were declared illegal, a LAPD cop specialising in detecting replicants, called a \"Blade Runner\", must terminate them, termination is called \"retirement\". Retired police officer Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is detained by officer Gaff (Edward James Olmos) and brought to his former supervisor Bryant (Wild Wild West's M. Emmet Walsh) who informs him that four replicants have escaped and hijacked a ship back to Earth, they are trying to extend their their lifespan. These replicants are Leon Kowalski (Brion James), Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), Zhora (Joanna Cassidy) and Pris (Daryl Hannah), Deckard initially refuses the assignment to retire them, but Bryan threatens him, he reluctantly agrees and carries out a test at Tyrell Corporation used for Nexus-6 models, the assistant of Dr. Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel), experimental replicant Rachael (Sean Young), believes herself to be human, given false memories, but a more extensive test is required. Roy and Leon do their own investigation to find a way to extend their lifespan, which for a replicant is four years, and they learn about genetic designer J.F. Sebastian (William Sanderson), Pris later finds him and manipulates him to gain her trust, Rachael meanwhile visits Deckard herself and tries to prove her humanity, showing him a family photo, but he explains that her memories are implanted, taken from a real person, she leaves in tears. Deckard finds and searches Leon's hotel room, he is then lead to the strip club where Zhora works, he chases and kills her, Bryant then comes and tells him to kill Rachael, who has departed from Tyrell Corporation, he does spot her in a crowd, but is attacked by Leon, until Rachael kills him using Deckard's gun. While Deckard and Rachael return to his apartment where he promises not to hunt her, they share an intimate moment, and he stops her from leaving, meanwhile at Sebastian's apartment Roy tells Pris the others are dead, Sebastian reveals he also has a short lifespan, due to the genetic premature aging disorder \"Methuselah Syndrome\". They go together to see Dr. Tyrell at his penthouse, Roy demands more life from his maker, Tyrell says that this is impossible, dismisses doing \"questionable things\" and praising Roy's advanced design and accomplishments in his short life, Roy kisses Tyrell, then kills him, Sebastian manages to escape alone in the elevator. Deckard finds Sebastian's apartment and ambushed by Pris, he manages to kill her just as Roy returns, Roy's body is starting to shut down, he chases Deckard through the building up to the roof, Deckard tries to jump across to another roof, but ends up hanging, Roy jumps across to watch him as his grip loosens, but Roy hoists him onto the roof and saves him. In his last moments of his life Roy delivers a monologue about how his memories are about to be lost (this was improvised by Hauer), Deckard watches silently as Roy dies in front of him. Gaff arrives and shouts to his Deckard, \"It's too bad she won't live, but then again, who does?\", he returns to his apartment and finds Rachael there, depending on the version you are watching, Deckard and Rachael either leave the apartment block to an uncertain future, or drive through an idyllic pastoral landscape. There are three versions of the film to watch: the 1982 original, the 1992 Director's Cut (which drops Ford's narration and has a bleaker \"happy ending\"), and 2007's The Final Cut (where Scott had complete artistic control, and contains an extended unicorn dream sequence). Ford is really good as the gloomy but determined ex-cop, Young is suitably mysterious, Hauer is exceptional as the nasty android with fake memories of a nonexistent childhood, and the supporting cast members do well also, it is well directed by Scott, and the story is interesting and relatively easy to follow, but what really makes this film ahead of its time is the neon-drenched metropolis, the darkened world full of flying vehicles and cool looking buildings, it is a fantastic futuristic science- fiction thriller. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration and Best Visual Effects, it won the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design and Best Production Design/Art Direction, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing, Best Make Up Artist, Best Score for Vangelis (Chariots of Fire), Best Sound and Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score.

A friend of mine had recommended to check this out, and that I should go for the Director's Cut version. So naturally I got quite excited when I found this in said rental store and noticed that it was indeed the Director's Cut. When I finally sat down to watch it, I was immediately engrossed in the action. Not long after it starts, something happens. Then the movie kind of slows down... a lot. It keeps that slow pace for a very long time... and then something happens again... and it returns to the slow pace. The whole movie is like that... mostly slow, with a burst of action here and there. I don't know if this was on purpose or not... but as a result, I found the movie mostly dull. Just for the record, I wasn't expecting a huge action-packed sci-fi shoot-everything-you-see extravaganza. The plot is pretty good, just very oddly paced. The acting is pretty much flawless. The actors playing Replicants have to portray a adult characters with the emotional maturity of a young child... and they pull it off perfectly. The special effects are amazing; quite an accomplishment for the time the film was made.*MINOR SPOILERS*One of my biggest problems with this film is that the investigative portion of the film doesn't seem to hold water... Deckard pretty much runs into each of the Replicants casually, rather than figure out where they are, or where they will go.*END SPOILERS*Now, what I found great about this film(and the main reason everyone loves it, I would suspect) is the great theological and ethical questions it asks. Chief of them would probably be: If we actually created Artificial Intelligence(A.I.), would it be right to consider them lesser creatures... as opposed to equals? It also demonstrates how everything we create are for our own use, not for the greater good. And how everything we create, we exploit and use. The film holds many truths about human nature and much food for thought, stuff that will create discussions between you and your friends... but not enough. Having watched this so close to my second viewing of Abre Los Ojos, I can't help but compare... and this just loses right away. In the end, this is a very good sci-fi film with astounding visuals and some depth, but I fail to see how it's the best sci-fi film of all time.

Dick(since apparently this is a very accurate representation of his novel, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep... one I have yet to find and read).

Dick. Blade Runner is a blend of 1940s private detective yarns and futuristic society landscapes. Beautifully shot on stunning stylized sets by director Ridley Scott, fresh off another totally original success with his earlier film, 'Alien' Scott manages to create a future as unpredictable as the actual passing of time. Bizarre neo- Victorian dance fashions. Chinese vendors and gigantic hologram advertisements, hovering cars locked on an invisible monorail, that even now twenty three years later still manage not to resemble an 82 Pinto. The main sci-fi story centers around Deckard ( Harrison Ford ) Who is a 'Blade Runner' That is a cop who specializes in one field. His area of expertise is locating and destroying 'replicants'. Android slaves with a built in four year life span, which is apparently a couple of years too long for their uptight creators when they jump an off world shuttle and slaughter the entire crew in the process. They then return to earth in an effort to blend into normal society. Where it's Deckard's job to hunt them down. Fans looking for a reprisal of Ford's Han Solo roll will not find it here. Deckard is somewhat more downtrodden than the upbeat Captain of the 'Millinaum Falcon' From the outset, Deckard seems burned out, and has to be blackmailed into doing the job. He is much more stern and serious for this sci-fi fantasy. Unlike 'Star Wars' there is nothing for children in this movie. This is a dark tale, conveyed by director Scott's stark use of pale color and shadow. Ford's quiet understatement and pauses when delivering his lines really sets the bleak tone well and he's always giving the audience the impression that Deckard isn't the bad ass he once was. It's a fine performance by Ford, but Rutger Hauer as the Nexus six android Roy Batty steals the show. As he and his gang of fugitives try to figure out how to reverse the four year life span while staying one step ahead of Deckard, Hauer as Batty makes you afraid for the people they are interrogating. In the end even Deckard seems terrified of the violent and murdering Batty. Hauer's oratory summery during one of the final scenes is moving and memorable. Also look for E. Emmet Walsh in another strong supporting role as Deckard's overbearing and wisecracking boss. All in all, there isn't too much bad you can say about 'Blade Runner.' If I had one knock, it would be that I didn't feel the date was pushed far enough into the future. Even when the film came out in 1982 it seemed that technology wouldn't have the chance to catch up to the premise. I think Dick and company would have been better served had they tried for the latter part of the 21st century rather than the first part. But this is one small bolt loose in an otherwise tight machine.

One is two rethink the entire movie and come up with a lot more plot and fill in the long empty gaps that the movie already has in between the action scenes.

Even though this movie is not too long, it is very boring. You would think they are taking their time to explain something but no. This movie hardly went into any real depth. The first chase scene was not done well at all (I almost laughed). Gosh, the climax!

The movies attempts at being poetic is truly pathetic.

His challenge is brought to him by a beautiful woman (Rachel/Sean Young) who is a replicant, or what we might call today a human clone.The scene that sets up his challenge is when Rachel comes to visit Deckard.

And if you don't play\u0085\" At that point, Deckard pounds him twice on the head with a lead pipe. Roy replies; \"That's the spirit!\" Then, when he has him cornered one last time, Roy tells Deckard; \"Quite an experience to live in fear isn't it.

The original book is a fantastic read, with detailed imagery, and a truly deep understanding of human nature and perversion. The movie is one of the rare cases in which it is just as superior (if not more) than the book it followed.Harrison Ford does a fantastic job playing the hardened \"Blade Runner\" who makes a life of hunting down and killing escaped \"skin jobs\", \"replicants\", or in the books case \"andys\". The new Nexus 6 (brain unit) is a highly superior android virtually identical to a human. These Nexus 6 are not per say evil, but come across as being murderers--this is due to the fact that 1. they have a lack of \"empathy\", and 2. the are being hunted down like dogs.

The computer wars were beginning and arcade games were the craze, yet our lives were at a height of sociability. Things were simple for the sake of simplicity. Life seemed to make more sense. But our minds were unconsciously drifting away from reality, whilst reality slowly made its way towards the visions of this powerful film. 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?', written by famous American Science Fiction author Phillip K Dick, was adapted to the screen by Sir Ridley Scott into 'Blade Runner'. Ridley's masterful transformation of Dick's nocturnal vision to celluloid, confused audiences who misunderstood a world which would seem more like reality only ten years later in the technology boom of the 90s. The film gained 'turkey' status upon its release and was quickly abandoned as a mess, soon doomed to gain dust in relentless video libraries.Ten years later the world only further resembled Blade Runner's scary vision. Upon its 1992 re-release, tickets sold out before they even hit the box-office. Even critic Roger Ebert rephrased his 1982 statement claiming it a masterpiece. And here began the Legacy of the most acclaimed Cult Film. Film critics around the world named it the most important science-fiction of all time with Kubrick's 2001 - and the most visually mesmerizing.The film follows the enlightenment of a Blade Runner (a cop) Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) in Los Angeles 2019, a dystopia falling apart from permanent drizzling twilight, rare natural life and where technology dictates existence. Following early retirement from his police unit, Deckard is forced into a desperate assignment by his ex-boss 'Bryant'. Four Replicants (humanoids) have escaped from an 'off-world colony', taking a shuttle back to Earth for unknown reasons. His mission: To kill all Replicants declared illegal on Earth. Deckard's unconscious approach to his job in a world deteriorating from lack of nature,sociability and eternal darkness slowly deteriorates when his eyes open to the most important questions in life. Beginning his investigations in the Pyramids of the Tyrell Corporation, responsible for manufacturing the Replicants, he meets his turning point, Rachel, who due to Deckard's Void Kompff machine (an empathy tester) is found a Replicant. Following a cold, immoral revelation to her about her origins, he is inevitably drawn to her emotionally, soon leading to his first sign of awakening, LOVE.From a cold beginning, without any sign of 'empathy' towards those around him, what Deckard finds out about Rachel, Elden Tyrell, and the so called \"EVIL\" Replicants he intercepts, enable him for the first time to feel and understand Love, Hate and the preciousness of Life respectively. Roy Batty, the leader of the Replicant mutineers, played convincingly by Dutch actor Rutger Hauer, is the most important symbol in the film, and is the ultimate enlightenment in Deckard's quest for humanity in learning that no matter if you're human or not, love, compassion and empathy are the most important human characteristics, and some Replicants are \"more human than human\". Contrary to initial perception, Batty shows these characteristics and we sympathize with him, something we wouldn't usually do with an 'artificial' human, with theoretically no emotions. Tyrell becomes the focal point of human degradation, in that in his vision of technological advance, he brings humanity, morality and nature closer to extinction as he sits atop his corporation like a 'Pharoah'.Finally, there are many evidences to suggest 'Deckard' is a Replicant, and this has been immortal debate since release. Either way, the film's message remains as strong. It's filled with overwhelming symbolism and meaning, that one viewing of this art-work will be exhausting.The film's intentions are not only to question what makes us human, but it also makes strong focus on reflecting our current issues of world Conservation, technological advance and the degradation of humanity from the media, exploitation, capitalism, and the complacency and destructive nature of humanity. In Ridley Scott's vision, the Sun that gives life has been blocked out by pollution due to the dominance of technology, and dreams of Unicorns suggests we long for the past, for rarity in Nature. What one must notice is that 'Eyes' play a key symbol throughout the film in explaining this, for it appears that most are 'artificial' than not.'Blade Runner' is Ridley Scott's masterpiece and perhaps one of the most poignant films of all time. Countless copycats including 'The Fifth Element', and 'Akira' have tried to imitate his legendary vision of a dark world gone wrong, which only seems more possible as the years fly by. I am happy to see that Blade Runner is so respected and that people understand its vision. It has embedded itself into my movie collection and along with 'The Mosquito Coast', another similar film with Harrison Ford regarding humanity, is my favorite film of all time.The music composed by 'Vangelis' is God-sent, sounding so mythical and dream-like. Set designs and cinematography have rarely been equaled \u0096 marvelously detailed. The whole cast were superb in bringing their characters to life. Especially Joe Turkel (Tyrell) and Rutger Hauer who played opposites of one another beautifully. Harrison Ford was irreplaceable as the lead, showing his transformation from a cold being into an human being expertly - it just seems so natural with him. However I believe Rutger Hauer should have received the Oscar for his performance as the human like Replicant. He has a commanding presence. Sean Young, playing Rachel, was a great choice. She's stunning and projects innocence well in showing Deckard's shortcomings. This film will be in the hearts of more 'as time goes by' and will never again end up accumulating dust in forgotten sections of video libraries. It's more than a 'classic'. I recommend everybody who loves film or philosophy to watch and explore its masterful telling. I have never seen a film as movingly deep.

I just want to add my highly subjective two cents. I've seen this movie numerous times now. After watching it again last night, I still find it so moving that I can't get it out of my head. I'm always immediately caught by the combination of the visuals and the music. Their synergy never seems to lose its impact, continuing to haunt my mind after the credits have rolled. The colours, the sounds. They all create this vision of a future that is heart-rendingly beautiful in its painful loneliness. The shots of the busy, crowded city contrasts with the man whose soul is silent. He might narrate the film (in the theatrical version), but to me his forced talking always seems as if he is urging himself to be alive and be part of the world around him. If he dropped the speaking, he might move back to his innate inertia. The movie places you in his shoes, making you feel and hear the loneliness that is his life. Ironic, so much sound, yet so much silence. Vangelis' music is brilliant in it's ability to make the score more silent than silence itself. Also ironic is that Deckard's truest human interactions are with replicates. His conversations with real humans are devoid of meaning to him, and are only necessitated by his assignment. But his dealings with the replicates take on something greater: meaningful, important interactions at a subconscious level that leaves him changed each time. And then there is Rachel. The only other like him. The only person who feels real and alive to him, who makes him notice he's alive. It must have been some sort of betrayal to him when she implies she doesn't know whether her feelings for him can be trusted, whether they are real or artificial.Perhaps the film's message is to show us that to be human is to feel and to live and to care. To be consciously present in each moment, as exhibited by the replicates desperately savouring their precious lives and implanted memories. This is opposed to the routine and almost automated behaviour of the real humans in the film, where each interaction is business-like. Though the world of Blade Runner doesn't appear to be showing up anytime soon (the future has changed too much now to conform to the projected visions of the book or film) it's still a lesson we can learn. We don't want to be among the few who are truly alive, living in a world crowded by people whose social behaviour has evolved into that of robots. It is telling that real animals are practically absent in this film. Because they cannot help being natural and true to themselves, their lively presence would have conflicted with the authenticity of the settings, confusing the feelings this film evokes.Though I consider my tastes minimalist when it comes to romance, I'd have to qualify this film as such. It is in equal parts science-fiction, drama and romance. My girlfriend, though a peace- and nature-loving Korean animist, considers this film a favourite in spite of the violence and absence of nature. Together with The Terminator she also ranks it amongst the most romantic films of all time. So there you have it. It's memorable in every way and appeals to both genders. Having just watched the theatrical version, I find it hard to forget the final images. Deckard driving off with Rachel, fleeing, looking for a life they could share in a world that makes sense to them and allows them to just be. Strange how this scene is bathed in a light that is otherwise absent from the film, which for the most part was set in a perpetual night. The daylight makes it almost dreamlike, which it perhaps signifies. Yet I like to entertain the thought that the end is not a dream, that they did get away.

Dick's 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep'. Quite frankly, having read the book before seeing the movie, it seemed quite disappointing to me, when compared with the original. The importance of more interesting, philosophical subjects of the novel was cut down meaningfully; namely, the philosophical consequences of the idea of a humanoid robot that would be superior to man himself in any way. J.R Isidore (transformed into the very minor character of J.F Sebastian), Buster Friendly, Rick's wife and her eery mood-dialer, and most of all the electric sheep, the most wonderful symbolism in the novel. These were all removed. The idea of the artificial animals was only hinted, as was the unsolved question of whether Deckard himself is a replicant or not.But IN SPITE OF ALL THAT -- when considered individually by its own right, as it should be (it's no accident that the film and the novel have different names!) Blade Runner is still one of the masterpieces of sci-fi cinema. Harrison Ford - though he plays the exact same character he always does - fits right in. Ridley Scott's directing is superb.

Hauer plays the angry, but fragile Roy Batty with what I think is his best performance. Sean Young I don't think has ever again had a role to fit her like Rachael. Cold and distant, and later frightened and vulnerable. Even Walsh puts in a fine performance as the crusty policeman.I am glad William Saunderson has found his way back to stardom with Deadwood. He has always been great at this type of role.All in all there just isn't anything wrong enough with this film to give it even one bad comment. I just can't think of ONE.

Only by understanding the concept of Mercerism can the reader begin to understand the real differences between humans and androids.

This film is from the bygone age of film making where a plot line was actually essential, and movies didn't sell based on how much money was put into the special effects. That said it also looks like somebody put a lot of effort into the special effects in this film. It is clear to me that Ridley Scott put a lot of time and effort into this movie.

Blade Runner excels in all.The easy one: the Text. Inspired by a novel of the most humanist of SF author, Philip K. Dick, the story deals with androids banned from Earth, which are tracked by humans . The fantastic idea is that the audience is caught in a constant paradox: you wait the androids to appear like robots. Error, they show the most humanity and it is the humans who act like robots(indeed, a true respect to the core of Dick's Philosophy). The context: Another asset of this movie is the overloading of the senses: majestuous sets, props, wardrobe, cinematography, editing. The director takes the time in every shoot to show how humans have evolved. It is a big change from nowadays movies where in 10 seconds, you see 10 cuts. All this care for the materiality of this fiction world made Dick very enthusiast, even though he didn't see the picture.The subtext: It's the message of the director, or sometimes, what the audience has understood. I always feel deeply moved by this movie, but i can't never explain why. I suppose it acts on a non-literate level. In some way, i'm sure it addresses the collective unconscious that every body share.Nearly 25 years after its release, it is still a date in cinema history. It teaches a lesson to today movies, which, even with the help of digital effects, haven't still produce another milestone (my regard for the prequel Star Wars Movies).

Blade Runner is almost a perfect film: perfect casting, terrific score by Vangelis, beautiful,futuristic sets that do not appear contrived, incredible cinematography, convincing acting. However, there is one thing that bothers me about the \"Director's Cut\" in any film. How can the director release the film for the general public, let it float around as a created entity for a few years, and then change it? A film, like a book, is a unique creation. The plot, the fate of the characters, the elements of the film, are unique to that film, so once the film is released, \"the die is cast\", so to speak. In my mind, something doesn't \"ring true\" about changing a film that has been in circulation for a period of time. It seems profane, somehow, to re-release it in a changed form once the viewing public has accepted it for what it is. How many books have you read where the author comes back a few years later and changes the elements of the book? If personally feel that once a film is released, that's it. The film is what it is and should not be changed. I have looked for the original version of Blade Runner, with Dekker's narration, which is smug, blunt, sarcastic, sometimes funny: it fleshes out his character. The original version more clearly illustrates exactly what kind of guy Dekker is, partly due to his narration. Unfortunately, the original version of the film is no longer available. It's obvious that the \"Director's Cut\" is a ploy to re-market the film. However, don't misunderstand me.

Replicants are sort of hard to detect because they look and act human. But they have one flaw: they only last a few years. Batty wants more time and seeks out his creator, Tyrell, to demand more time. Meanwhile, Decker is intrigued by Rachel (Sean Young, looking very beautiful), who is one of Tyrell's creations and has no conception of being a replicant.The final cut fixed a few errors in the original version, and added bonus footage, giving the film an even more impressive look.Finally the intriguing question that the film raises: is Decker himself a replicant? The dream sequence and the gift that Gaff (Edward James Olmos)leaves at the end of the film would suggest that this is a possibility (My personal feeling is that he is), but then, this would lead to even more questions, wouldn't it?

After feeling Luke warm about the viewing I decided in my infinite wisdom to give the movie another chance. I must have been wrong, since this is one of the most highly thought of movies of sci-fi times.I was not wrong.I can skip the fact that special effects have come much further than any person could have imagined. Even the people who constructed these fabulous worlds of the \"future\" would have no idea. In fact I miss movies with the character time and development that the older movies have. Blade Runner delivers---some---on this point. Decker is a largely human guy and you identify with him. What you don't know is what dirt they have on him to make him take on this task, but hey, let's let that go. Then there is the \"love\" he feels for the replicant. Does anyone actually believe this? When did the emotional ties get built so convincingly that you believe they are in love? Add to that Edward James Olmos. A weird oragami foldin', bow tie wearing, useless dude. He knows everything that is going on, yet never does much other than allude to that fact.Skipping that and on to the vision of the future. Flying cars. OK fine. Paging Mr. Jetson! Maybe in 1982 everyone thought that 2019 was a real long way away. There are just too many non futuristic things to make the idea fluent. Levelor blinds, busted up stucco and drywall in the houses. Heck, everything but the cars and guns was just as it is today. If we can develop alternate fuel sources and make a car fly, why couldn't the human race improve on anything else? What gets at the heart of this criticism is that the movie is just downright boring. The first replicant he shoots dies rather normally, much like a human. But what the heck is up with Pris? What's with the flailing death? She was not a robot after all. The best interaction is with Decker and Roy. More human and intimate than anything else in the movie.

The basic premise of the NEXUS-6 is that they are so perfect they are not allowed to last... because as they develop independent thoughts and, yes, feelings, they are a threat; consequently, they should be eliminated. A social analyst could write hours about this. But the film could be summed up in Roy Batty's final words: \"I have seen things you people wouldn't believe [...] those moments will be lost in time like tears in rain...\" Living four years as the NEXUS-6 or eighty as a healthy human being doesn't change things: the fact is that we all are we going to die, and everything's lost then unless we find a way to pass it on. Replicants cannot reproduce by themselves; art remains, and having read the original novel I recall a replicant there called Luba Luft, who was specially obsessed by art. And this movie is a work of art. Rutger Hauer could have been an early Gary Oldman, why he didn't find the success he deserved, I don't know. He was great as the demented, enraged, desperate but genial Roy Batty. Sean Young as Rachael is great too, with very subtle moments of quiet grief that are a real treasure. Daryl Hannah as Pris has a remarkable physical control, from the moment she stands like two minutes quiet as a statue, without even blinking her eyes, to the terrible moment of her death. And even Harrison Ford, having had a long chain of mediocre roles lately, is here in perhaps his best role ever. It's touching to see his face after Roy Batty's saving his life and then, as the dove flies, simply dying. It's as if he understood, and of course he did. The famous question of Rick Deckard being a replicant or not is finally solved in the director's cut: no doubts remain. Ridley Scott had then these shadowy, oppressive environments that made his movies so trademark. This movie transcends the \"science fiction\" genre and moves into deeper territory.

He would walk you though the film using narration that highlighted what he was thinking while you watched him perform his investigative duties with a featureless \"poker face\" to fool the bad guys.Periodically, and most often impersonated, the detective would \"step out\" of a scene he was in and talk to the audience instead of narrating over the action.

This movie is not SO outdated as to warrant a bad review at this late date, but it is beginning to show signs of wear about the edges, and fails to give you the science of the sci-fi genre. This endeavor attempts to show the prejudices of our society, and features a just-coming-out-of-retirement Blade Runner played by post Star Wars but pre-Indiana Jones's Harrison Ford; a hunter of humanoid AI, with Daryl Hannah and Rutger Hauer as the principle \"bad guys,\" and Sean Young (Lois Einhorn of Ace Ventura: Pet Detective fame) as the hapless love interest. Not a bad mix for a film on \"social responsibility.\"The score has a definite \"Fifth Element\" feel to it, meaning Luc Beson's endeavor looked to Blade Runner for some of its inspiration.

I really like going there because the changing rooms don't have doors on them and I sometimes wander in and pretend to be from the Ukraine. Of course I'd only wander into the ladies changing room and stay there pretending to be confused until some of the staff came and led me out. Well, I used to do that. Last time I tried it there actually was a girl from the Ukraine, who I think used to be army special forces or something.Anyway, when I get discharged from hospital the doctors tell me to take it easy for a few days, until the swelling has gone down so I ask my mum to hire out a DVD from the shop for me. But rather than hiring out the film I told her to she decides to ask advice from the old guy Henry who works there. He's had something against me ever since Rufus got stuck down the back of the freezer and destroyed all that ice cream. So Henry being the 'expert' on films that he is tells mum to hire out 'Blade Runner' by Ridley Scott telling her that it's a 'classic'.Thanks mum! That's not insensitive after what I've been put through! All the horrible memories of the unprovoked attack and the police caution came flooding back when I saw the title of the film. Besides, how many times have I told her to not believe anything Henry says? Especially when he starts by saying \"The police came to the shop last night asking about your son\u0085\" In 'Blade Runner' Harrison Ford plays Rick Deckard, a man who hunts down robots for a job. That sounds easy doesn't it? Well it's not because these 'replicants' look like people, and he has to use an old projector or something to read their minds, somehow. It seems to take AGES so why not do this instead: Rick Deckard: \"Hi. How are you? Would you like a drink of water?\" Replicant: \"No thanks, I'm not thirsty.\" Rick Deckard: \"That's right! Only humans can get thirsty! Die robot!!\" BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! That's much easier than some stupid test and he could kill far more robots that way. His boss would be really pleased I'm sure. I mean, if Rick Deckard sold cars and in one day he sold seven, but there were only four in the shop his boss would be really pleased, just like if there were only four replicants on the loose and Deckard managed to kill eleven.And whilst we're on the subject of robots looking like people, wouldn't it be easier to make them look a little different? Couldn't they, I dunno, look like George Hamilton or something? That way there'd be no need for the test I just made up and anyone who looked like George Hamilton would be shot. Obviously George Hamilton would have to have plastic surgery to look like someone else, maybe George Lucas. That way when people shouted \"Hey George!\" he'd know that they were talking to him and look round. If he looked like Bob Hoskins and people shouted \"Hey Bob!\" he might get confused.Also, if I brought a robot and it only worked for four years I'd be pretty annoyed. I'll bet they have a program in the future like \"Watchdog\" over here in the UK. They'd soon have Tyrell on there going on and on about how he was selling robots that only worked for 4 years. If they had him on 'Watchdog' I bet Nicky Campbell would make insulting comments about Tyrell's glasses because they are kind of stupid looking. Surely though another company would make robots that worked for 10 years or something, or until their hair went out of fashion, and then beat the Tyrell Corporation at their own game. And what's with the whole \"more human than human\" thing anyway? That's a moronic motto. How about \"sexy robots that put out\"? That'd be a better motto, or maybe \"Tyrell don't smell, are bots are hot and we make 'em like George whether you like it or not!\" That's decent marketing and in the form of a rap as well to appeal to kids and gangsta's.After watching this film I can't wait for the future, but I don't think it's a classic, not like the excellent 'Battlefield Earth' or a film I wrote last night. There should have been more emphasis on what pleasure robots like Daryl Hannah get up to and maybe some steamy scenes in a women's changing room.

Slowly but surely this one has made it into the top 5 of my 'best movies of all time' list.I don't particularly care for the director's cut version, though.

Most of the cast who were unknown before this movie have moved on to fame (and some to fortune) - and rightfully so.From a technical point of view there is not much to criticize. More than 20 years later this movie still doesn't look dated (apart from 'Atari'-neon signs). The atmosphere is created with a lot of attention to detail, and the models of buildings are some of the most beautiful and believable ones I have ever seen.Now I recently read the book on which it is based ('Do androids dream of electric sheep' by Philip K. Dick). It's a quirky read and, frankly, not a very good book. It has too many plot holes, deus-ex-machina devices and logical inconsistencies, plus a total letdown of an ending.

Their romance is a vital part of the story but I felt it was given very little focus.However on second and third viewing I suddenly realized what a masterpiece \"Blade Runner\" is. I seemed to \"get\" it; perhaps I understood the point of the film's ending more. I originally loathed the wacky OTT climax, considering it stupid and unoriginal/unimaginative - but on second viewing I picked up on all the subtleties and was touched by Hauer's final speech, particularly the \"like tears in rain\" moment.Overall this really is a fantastic sci-fi film noir story - it successfully mixes various genres. Its effects are a bit outdated now and if you sit down to watch it expecting too much you're likely to be disappointed - it has its fair share of flaws (from technical to story-wise) but if you can overlook some of these it really is a great deal of fun, even if it's not \"the\" best science fiction film (as some people have claimed).", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 5}, "heading": "Great, but requires more than a single viewing", "date": "2004-12-13T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0977360"}, {"content": "This is simply Scott's finest hour.

In doing so, Scott restored his original vision and the film was released in 1992, 10 years after a disastrous reception from audiences and critics.In 1982, \"Blade Runner\" was released between \"Alien\" in 1979 and \"Legend\" in 1985, and Scott was on a wild streak and it seemed that only he could stop himself, since he was bringing the audience one visually dazzling and intricate masterpiece after the other.As a matter of fact, \"Blade Runner\" is still one of the only sci-fi films released in the last 25 years to really have a serious impact on audiences; Steven Spielberg's \"Minority Report,\" which is ironically another acclaimed adaptation of a work by Philip K. Dick, was another example.\"Blade Runner,\" adapted from Dick's acclaimed novel \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" is set in the 21st century, and Rick Deckard (Ford), is a \"blade runner,\" special police detectives who have the authority to kill \"replicants\" (human-like androids) on the spot. Replicants have been outlawed on Earth, so they're confined to a space colony on a nearby planet, where they are forced into slave labor, and they only have four-year lifespans - so they value life more dearly than any human ever could.A group of renegade replicants (Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Joanna Cassidy, Brion James) hijack a space vessel and come to Earth to search for their maker, Tyrell (Joe Turkel). And so Deckard is forced to lead a private investigation to track down and eliminate the four androids before anyone figures out they're on Earth.This is Ridley Scott's most beautiful and philosophical film to date.

But the film, which appears on the surface to be just a straightforward science fiction thriller about evil robots, is in fact a far deeper tale about creation and humanity.In mid-21st century L.A, Deckard (Harrison Ford) makes routine cullings of rogue 'replicants', human-like robots engineered for slave purposes on Earth and off-world colonies. A small group of these robots, led by the charismatic Batty (Rutger Hauer) have infiltrated L.A. and it is up to Deckard to track them down and 'retire' them before they can do any damage...That at least, is the thrust of the story, which has one or two minor problems. The set-up to the final shoot-out is clumsily handled, and the final 'happy ending' feels out-of-place with the rest of the movie. However, there are many interesting depths to this picture.Batty's encounter with his doomed creator Tyrell (Joe Turkel) has a strong parallel with man destroying God in the pursuit of life. Deckard's affair with Tyrell's assistant Rachel (Sean Young), herself revealed to be a replicant, places his own humanity in an ambiguous light. Parallels are made between the replicants and their human creators in that the questions they both have are the same: who am I? where do I come from? where am I going? how long have I got?The backdrop to this is laid out in fantastic production design that blends futuristic technology (and some now dated corporate logos) with old style buildings. Deckard's apartment and Tyrell's high-rise office are influenced in their own way by the designs of Egyptian pyramids. This is accentuated beautifully by Vangelis's music score, including the touching Deckard/Rachel love theme.Ford is good in a role that is considerably more cowardly and stolid than some of his other action parts.

In any case, the theater was not especially large but I remember the crowd being rather thin (though it was a matin\u00e9e). Beyond that, I can't say why such an impression was made on me by a movie that is way over the head of a 12 year-old. I probably merely embedded the memories to draw upon for a later time. I grew to consider Blade Runner my favorite sci-fi movie. Its tone, nuances, and characterizations are subtler and more seductive to a \"thinking\" film viewer vs. the visual bludgeoning of much of modern action-/explosion-driven sci-fi popcorn movies. I was so obsessed with it when I got older I actually bought a ridiculously expensive laser disc player just so I could have highest quality letter boxed version of the Director's Cut. Ah, how I wish I could recapture those absurdly-spent dollars and spend them on DVDs instead--but such is the toll of staying on the bleeding-edge of technology. The pacing and action of Blade Runner will not be to everyone's liking and Harrison Ford plays Deckard pretty tight to the vest. There is none of the garrulousness of Han Solo, but, then there really shouldn't be. Deckard is a dramatically different kind of character (literally and figuratively) and Ford plays him exactly as he should. Deckard is anything but a cocky, shoot-from-the-hip cop. Nearly everyone remarks on the visuals of BR, so let's get that out of the way: amazing, stunning, and remarkable. The fact that they still impress and hold up 20+ years later where our senses have become blown-out and numbed from over-exposure to CGI is all the more remarkable. It is evidence of the movie's powerful artfulness. \"The Return of the King\" is the only movie I've seen in recent memory that meshes live action and CGI in a truly believable (and astonishing) manner--though occasionally Jackson cannot bely his horror-movie director instincts. The opening scene of Los Angeles, 2021, is one of the most memorable and breathtaking in modern film. Vangelis' ethereal score seals the deal and enhances the visuals and drama perhaps better than any soundtrack ever has. I'm a huge fan of electronic music (a la the \"old school\" like Tangerine Dream, not the pure techno music of today necessarily) so perhaps I have more of a propensity for Vangelis than others.If you like the pacing of typical film noir translated to sci-fi, Blade Runner is for you. Its vision of the future is bleak (aren't they all?), but that vision is stunning and powerful. If you like the lurid, music video-like editing of most modern sci-fi/action movies, then you'll probably find Blade Runner dull and anemic and will disregard its artistic achievements.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Seminal, awe-inspiring", "date": "2004-09-04T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0191819"}, {"content": "In my humble opinion is Philip K Dick\u00b4s works among the most intelligent and fascinating in modern science fiction.

Top 100 of all-time? I don't think so. Here's why:SPOILERS AHEAD1) Incredibly slow pacing...for an action/adventure type film, there is just way too much down time. I can only take so many minutes of watching a man (Deckard, played by Harrison Ford) drink himself into oblivion while staring at photographs. 2) Special effects that really date themselves (the original Star Wars came out several years before this and looks much better in today's light than this film). 3) I didn't fear the Replicants. I actually felt more sympathy for them than for alcoholic Deckard. 4) Poor set up with Deckard being convinced to come back to kill 4 of the replicants. Rather than a clear motivation, we're left to trust that Ford has no choice...simply because if he's not a cop he's a small (i.e. regular) person. Who cares! 5) I can't tell if the dialogue was really poor, or if the acting (especially Ford's) was sub-par. I think it might be both. 6) If the Replicants are due to expire any day now (since they have a 4-year lifespan), then why not sit back and just wait for them to die? The climatic scene with Deckard battling Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), ends up with Batty actually saving Deckard from death. Batty then sits down and expires. THE END! That sound you just heard was all of the tension/suspense deflating from the balloon, rather than exploding with a loud pop! Lame. 7) As for all of the ridiculous suggestions that Deckard is in fact a replicant, why is it then that he gets tossed around like a rag doll whenever he's battling a replicant? Doesn't make sense, although this would have been a great twist to the movie if the Writer/Director had intended it rather than leaving it to the rabid fans to come up with the idea.Sorry to be a wet blanket on what is considered by way too many people to be one of the best films ever made...but this film has far too many holes in it and slow pacing to qualify as a good film, let alone one of the best ever made. I give this a 5/10, but it only gets those 5 points because the film was definitely ahead of its time back in 1982. It was just poorly executed.

Robots have been created that simulate humans (replicants) and are used as slave labor. A new class of replicants, the Omega 6, has been created and replicate humans more than anyone can every imagine. When four of them hijack a ship and head for earth to try and extend their ephemeral lives, Deckard is commissioned to \"retire\" the rogues.The last time I saw this film was probably twelve years ago or better, so it was pretty hazy. Having watched it just now, it was totally different from what I expected. Ridley Scott (director), rather than create the action flick I expected this to be, instead favored lengthy character development. He did this to show the similarities and marriage between man and the product of his godly labors, the robot. At times this makes the movie seem long and drawn out, but is otherwise necessary to the plot and point of the film. The evolution of the robot mentally to the state of man is excellently depicted in Rutger Hauer's character, Roy, and in Sean Young's character Rachael. They express sadness, anger, love, insanity, kindness, and the innate human quality of self-preservation.I was confused however in the odd relationship between Deckard and Rachael. It was almost as if he were dictating or instructing, like that of a programmer, a piece of equipment to respond to his amorous advances. This didn't feel quite right in the film even though I am aware Rachael's conscious mind was new to feelings of love or affection.Also Rutger Hauer's Roy was just a little too outlandish despite being motivated by his desperate attempts at survival. (SPOILER)He is brutally violent and repulsive in killing two humans and then ironically shows Deckard mercy and kindness. I guess this just epitomizes being irrational with no logical thought progression.All in all, this was a good sci-fi movie from another one of Philip K. Dick's novels. If you want to see a \"today's version\" of this film you should watch \"Screamers\", also written by Philip K. Dick.

The conflict is not only between the Replicants and the Humans (in fact, as god-like corporate head honcho James Tyrell puts it -they're \"more human than human\"), but also the conflict within Harrison Ford's character, the government assassin brought out of retirement to slay the 5 rogue Replicants, led by a philosopher-warrior Replicant played beautifully by Rutger Hauer. Harrison Ford's narration has been blasted by some, and would you believe it, they removed it for the 'Director's Cut', thoroughly eliminating my desire to see said Cut. The narration is the final and crucial complement to an intoxicatingly spellbinding blend of Ridley Scott's masterful cinematography and scene-sense...Vangelis' incomprehensibly beautiful soundtrack (perhaps his best), and the understated, dream-like acting from the supporting cast, creating perhaps the most entrancing color film of all time. To remove Ford's narration is criminal, SEE THE ORIGINAL VERSION IF YOU CAN FIND IT...an increasingly difficult task.

Just be in a relaxed frame of mind, and turn the lights low.Watch for the scene where Tyrell unwittingly meets with Hauer's Replicant...who wants \"more life\" (the Replicant's lives, though rich with their powerful abilities, are brief..hence Tyrell's effort at explanation: \"The light that burns twice as bright burns half as long\"). Surrounded by gold and amber materials and ambient lighting in his heavenly apartment, fittingly atop his pyramid-like office building monstrosity, Tyrell emerges in his exquisite silk robes with a god-like light and aura around him...not-so-subtle but savagely effective metaphor.

With stunning visuals, an ethereal and haunting musical score, and minimal dialogue Kubrick explored the idea that 'we are not alone'.In 1982 Ridley Scott also offered us a mature science fiction movie in the form of 'Blade Runner'. Adapted by Hampton Fancher from science fiction great Philip K. Dick's novel: 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?', 'Blade Runner' tells us a cautionary tale of what can happen if we don't keep a check on our scientific creations.When genetically engineered humans (called Replicants) are outlawed on Earth, a crack squad of police detectives is created to weed out any stray Replicant visitors. This is called the Blade Runner unit.Det. Rick Deckard , played with great humility by Harrison Ford, is retired from the force but is drawn back in by less than idle threats form his former boss; \"...if you're not 'cop' you're little people...\" Deckard was the best at 'retiring' Replicants and the unit needs him back. A small group of Replicants - with Rutger Hauer as their super-strong, super-genius leader Roy Battey - has hijacked an off-world shuttle and come to Earth with one goal: extend their built-in four-year life span.Deckard's pursuit of the illegally landed Replicants takes place through a rainy, gloomy future Los Angeles where the Earth is being depopulated in preference the for brighter pastures of off-world colonies. The city is always wet and soggy, cut through in sharp contrast by spotlights from floating advertisements for off-world colonization. The film is sombre and foreboding, with the action as exclamation points throughout, as opposed to being the main focus. Vangelis provides an exquisitely appropriate soundtrack which exactly mirrors the overall mood of the film. And the visual effects shots can still hold up to even today's high-end CGI standards. Dark, moody, damp, sombre...All words that one might not equate to an excellent science fiction film, but they certainly fit here. Scott gives us a glimpse of a future that seems bleak, where Mother Earth is no longer the focus of humanity. Within this is a detective story not unlike Mickey Spilane of a by-gone era; get the bad guys while trying to hold on to the girl.

Not only does it's visual style blow one's mind and open one's imagination, it raises important questions about life through the eyes of beings that are superior to humans in almost all aspects except for life span...all with a minimal but masterful plot. Add that to the fact that this is one of the few sci-fi films that doesn't rely entirely on special effects, wars and explosions to make it's story interesting and you have a classic. And the Director's Cut just makes the original better by giving the axe to Harrison Ford's abysmally bleak voice over and removing the light-hearted ending. Basically, it makes the film is more ambiguous which makes it far more interesting in my opinion. Ridley Scott wanted it to be released in exactly this fashion, and it's easy to see why.The visual and environmental similarities between BR and Scott's prior work, \"Alien\" (1979), are easy to spot right from the get go. It's fairly simple, they're both dark and use scaled Gothic models with Swiss precision, creating an entire world worthy of the dizzying imaginations of the audience. I would not be surprised at all to find out if both films had some of the same special effects people. That said, BR is a beautifully dark and futuristic world that is very convincing to the eye even though there's no CGI...which is a good thing because a lot of times models are more accurate and realistic. And believe it or not, for the most part, these effects easily hold up in today's world and look only slightly aged. And on top of it all, it has an excellent score that's a perfect fit.The story and plot are very simple but hold many smaller lessons. Deckard (Ford) is sent to kill the runaway replicants, but as he progresses throughout his journey, he begins to question if what he is doing is actually the right thing. Aren't they alive and conscious too? Don't they have hopes and dreams? How different from us are they really? Simple but extremely effective. Most sci-fi's nowadays are too busy trying to cast Vin Diesel or buy the best CGI effects without really worrying about the story. It's sad, but it's all about money. It's also why we don't see films like these any more....money is more important than making a quality film, but you don't need me to tell you that. What it all boils down to is a minimal story that works wonders for the movie and the audience's imaginations.Superb acting from all involved, masterful direction, incredible cinematography, world-creating special effects, and a great story make this one for the ages.

'Blade Runner' takes place in the far future where mankind has developed 'Replicants', genetically engineered robotic-human clones. 'Replicants' were designed to be physically superior to humans, but possess the same intelligence as the common human being. These androids are used as slaves for the 'hazardous exploration and colonization' of other planets in our solar system. At some point in time, (which isn't specified in the movie) a violent 'Replicant' revolt ensues on a colonized planet, this event causes replicants to be declared illegal on Earth, if a replicant is found on Earth it will be immediately destroyed. The title of the movie, 'Blade Runner', refers to a policeman whose job it is to shoot and kill any replicants they might find on Earth. (All of this, of course, is explained in the first three minutes of the movie, much clearer, and much shorter, but I decided to write about it anyways)The story is about a man named Rick Deckard (played by Harrison Ford), an experienced 'Blade Runner' who's unwillingly brought out of retirement to finish one last mission. Deckard has to track down four rogue replicants who have escaped from a planetary colony to Earth, killing innocent lives on the way. These four highly dangerous replicants are loose on the streets of L.A., and could kill again unless Deckard can deal with them first.This film isn't the first time in the Sci-Fi genre for Ridley Scott. His previous film in the Science-Fiction genre is 'Alien', which is an extremely well presented Horror film in space. Ridley Scott knows how to establish a mood, in 'Alien' he makes the audience feel clustered, tense, and alone on a gigantic moving spaceship, the same in 'Blade Runner'. Deckard's' chase scene through L.A. in 2019, halfway through the movie, best describes the atmosphere of the film. Medium shots of Deckard running through the streets, culturally diverse extras constantly filling the screen, talking street lights, loud-annoying street sounds, all of the preceding things add up to a perfect feel of a technologically corrupted Los Angeles. The final segments of this chase scene use slow motion, and a very bluesy musical score that gives the scene such finesse that an audience can easily see the horror of what mankind, in the film, has become.The overall presentation of 'Blade Runner' is very much like a gritty 1950's detective movie, with Harrison Ford in a majority of the scenes, becoming the stoic private eye who is fed up with his job. Ford has a knack for playing characters that are down on their luck, because of this he pulls off Rick Deckard's character flawlessly. Ford's calm and collected manner of performing all his actions fit the experienced 'Blade Runner' very well. All the roles in the film are played with great skill by the cast, every supporting performance adds to the magnificence of this film. The creator of the combat 'Replicant' models J.F. Sebastian is a timid scientist who lives with his homemade midget robots. William Sanderson, who plays Sebastian, portrays the shy scientist exactly how one would expect. Joe Turkel plays Tyrell, the owner of a major 'Replicant' producing company called Tyrell Corporation. Turkel also gives a great performance as an arrogant corporate owner. One actor to look out for is Rutger Hauer who plays the leader and most dangerous of the four escaped replicants, Roy Batty. The innocence he gives to the ruthlessly evil character is a scary thing to watch at times. What truly makes 'Blade Runner' a must-see film is its' dialogue, every conversation between characters has an underlying theme within it. One of my favorite lines is when Batty says 'We're not computers \u0085 we're physical'. The manner Hauer says it will get the viewer thinking. The writing also shines at the end with Roy's last lines in the film, overall a very moving script with a ton of different conversations that are worth listening to. From the opening scenes of a horribly industrialized Los Angeles, to the chase on L.A.'s crowded streets, and finally the gruesome fight scene which concludes the movie, 'Blade Runner' is one of the breakthrough films in the Sci-Fi genre. This movie is a non-stop journey through a very realistic rendition of the future. The thing to watch out with this movie is also considered to be a Film-Noir. This means that certain characteristics will constantly take shape in the film. For example a Film-Noir will only promote the cynical side of human nature, thus the genre 'Film-Noir' is a very ugly look at life. Many factors in 'Blade Runner' add up to a classification of Film-Noir some of them are: - Deckard's primary job is hunting and killing androids, not a very joyous job. Deckard himself has a very cynical way of saying things. - L.A. is portrayed as a city overrun by smoke and fog. The exterior shots of the city usually incorporate rain. Many scenes take places in dark, gloomy, and empty streets. - As you watch the film you will notice that bright colors are rarely used and the city streets are in constant darkness(because of the pollution blocking the sun).Film-Noirs are often filled with ambiguity and the protagonist is usually a depressing kind of guy. This might discourage people from watching it, but I highly recommend picking 'Blade Runner' up at the video store just to see at least one Film-Noir in your lifetime. This genre is one of those things that you either love or you hate, a proper Film-Noir will usually not have a picture perfect ending so don't expect one from 'Blade Runner' (at least the Director's Cut anyways). It is a highly overlooked film nowadays, when the common movie-goer thinks of Sci-Fi immediately big name titles like: The Star Wars Saga, Star Trek, The Matrix Trilogy, The Terminator, etc. are what they would think of. Blade Runner is the true definition of the Sci-Fi genre; it doesn't have the fun and games of Star Wars, or the huge firefight scenes of the Matrix, but delivers thoughts on what it means to live, what our future holds, and a serious outlook on humans in general.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 3}, "heading": "A Must See - Science Fiction at it's very best", "date": "2004-06-15T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0191805"}, {"content": "Simply brilliant, the blend of sci-fi and film noir, the superb acting of the cynical Deckard, poetic Batty and mouse like Sebastian creates a masterpiece which created the idea of what it means to be really human.

How does Roy Batty now Deckards name?.....When you realize that which Deckard realizes (he is a replicant made to kill replicants) you now can appreciate this movie on many levels. Certain lines like \"youve done a mans job\" take on whole new meanings. Each time I see this movie I see something completely different everytime.Without writing an essay I will only say that the themes are not limited to animals, colors and chess. For example the chess game that Tyrell plays with Sabastian is based off of a Game known as the immortal which is also a symbol of the pursuit of Roy Batty losing everything to win the game. I could go on but I wont. If you hate this movie it is either because you have not seen it for what it is or because you don't enjoy a movie with a lot of substance. This movie is number one on my list.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "More human then human *spoilers", "date": "2004-05-19T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0191801"}, {"content": "The most vivid depiction of the future ever captured on film.

At the same time this bounty hunter falls in love with one of the robots, it sounds cliched but she is something more than the one sheet hollywood heroine she raises the second theme of the movie what is real? not like the fake Matrix \"i like to explain everything in english third person' but this is a beatiful woman finding she is not real... the plot amazes the sets and the ending, when you see this film you'll either howl with amazement of the adventures taken place to sit in one place as though six knives have been thrown at your head and you will be thinking \"that...was art\"", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "watch this or die", "date": "2004-05-13T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0191799"}, {"content": "The title of Paul Sammon's excellent book about the making of Blade Runner, Future Noir, sums up the film best. In style, it bears a strong resemblance to the great works of film noir; but, with a new technological twist to it. We have your hard boiled private eye/cop sent to solve a case, characters who aren't what they seem, moral dilemmas, corruption, passionate but dangerous affairs, dark atmosphere, decay, depravity, and paranoia. In short, all the ingredients of Chandler, Cain, and Thompson.Ridley Scott, by this point, had made a name as a visual stylist. His films were amazing to look at, even if they weren't exactly showcases for great acting. What kept them from becoming total visual exercises was the casting of fine actors. Here again, he assembled a fine cast, but the visual elements dominate the film. The actors do their best with the difficult, often confusing material; but, ultimately, they are merely another component of a cinematic painting. It's not surprising, given that Scott had been a graphic artist.The design of the film owes some debt to films such as Metropolis and Just Imagine, the architectural drawings of Hugh Ferris, the city scenes of Tokyo, the work of Moebius, and the art of Edward Hopper and the futurist designers and graphic artists. Conceptual artist Syd Mead provided blueprints that Scott and company built upon and added layer after layer. DVD technology allows you to linger on each detail, taking in all those elements you couldn't see in the theater, but helped to complete the picture. Every piece of paper, every photo, sign, and magazine cover was created to add depth and character to this world. In fact, the city is the strongest character of the film.Much has been made of the number of replicants, whether Deckard is a replicant (is Holden also a replicant?), the nature of humanity, the role of animals, and many other themes and questions relating to the film. The beauty of the film to its fans (and major criticism from its detractors) is that so much is left open to interpretation. It's a film you can watch again and again and discover new ideas, or look at them from a new angle. When I first saw the film, the idea that Deckard was a replicant never entered my mind. After reading Sammon's book, I watched the film again, both the original theatrical release and the \"director's cut\" and noticed the subtle hints for the first time. The glowing light in the eyes never appeared deliberate before; I just assumed it was a reflection of the lights. After reading the book, I noticed that it only occurs in certain situations.The performances vary in quality. Even the so-so actors have their interesting moments; but some are stronger than others. The cold, dismal atmosphere of this film doesn't lend itself to a variety of emotions, so the performances tend to come off as limited. The replicants are more alive than the humans, possibly due to their short lifespan. They seem compelled to get as much living in as possible. As such, the replicant actors are more interesting, if not more skilled than the humans. Rutger Hauer is all over the place: he is menacing, laughable, haunted, distraught, psychotic, reflective, and destructive. Darryl Hannah, Brion James, and Joanna Cassady provide less rounded performances; but they are effective, in a quirky manner.Harrison Ford brings a Chandleresque weariness to Deckard, a man who hates his life but is trapped by it. The more he is in contact with the replicants, the more his humanity comes out. It is not his best performance, but it exceeds more recent work.Sean Young is a bit of a dilemma, she looks good, but she doesn't bring much to her role; but that is the nature of the character. So, is the flaw her acting, the direction, or the script? On one level, it is perfect for an artificial character whose life is an empty shell. On the other hand, it is frustrating as she never seems to rise to the moment.The Vangellis music is another source of polarization. I personally love a lot of synthesizer driven music of this era, while many have nothing but derision for it. To me, the synthesizer gives a voice to technology and helps animate it. Given that the city and technology of this world acts as another character, the music acts as that character's dialogue. I wouldn't want this type of music in a period piece or a comedy, but it works within the framework of this film.Ultimately, this is a film that either challenges you or turns you away. It stirs the imagination with its detail, and its omission of detail. You are often left to fill in missing elements. On some levels, this can be frustrating and probably the source of much derision for the film. On the other hand, it can be extremely stimulating to the mind and take you places that you never dreamed. It is not a prefect film, but it is an important one, from a design sense and a thematic one.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Future Noir", "date": "2004-05-06T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0191798"}, {"content": "What does it mean to be a human being? Likewise, what constitutes a lifetime? Or the meaning of life? Few if any movies or literature in general(yes, movies are a form of lit.), ask these questions in such a stunning or potent way. And unlike most movies dealing with these questions, it provides no simple answers. The viewer is left to find his or her own answers to those questions. We see these characters loose in a world that has effectively swallowed the human animal, and made it a function of the whole, rather than allowing any sort of individuality. Each is trying desparately to define him or herself against a back drop of time and its inexorable flow, against the pressures of a society rotting from the inside out. Humans here do everything they can to rise out of the mist, grease and dirt, and yet our characters dig into it, trying to figure out who and what they are, and if, in the long run, it really matters at all.The movie is visually stunning, both at a human level, and a backdrop level. Hypnotic and scary, yet strangely familiar. Everyone turns in a top notch performance, although Harrison Ford has said he felt that he did not do much more than provide a center focus for the set pieces. I have to disagree. He was the archtypal human working towards individuation. He was the reflection of his world for us. He provided an fully realized entry point for the viewer into this cacophany so we could understand the questions being asked. He was everyman. And that is one of the hardest roles to get right.This movie is a must see for everyone who has ever sat back and wondered what the meaning of it all might be. It offers no easy answers, but certainly asks the age old questions in a fantastic way.quotes:\"Painful to live in fear, isn't it? Like having an itch you can never scratch.

Sure, the synthesizers may sound a bit dated by today's standards, but given the subject matter in this film, it all fits perfectly. It would not be the same without it.Rarely have I heard so much attention to detail in a soundtrack - especially a sci-fi one. The art of making a good soundtrack is perhaps subtle to some, but Vangelis knew how to create the unconscious effect of suggestion to make his music fit the scene perfectly. This process involves more than picking minors for sad scenes, and majors for happy ones. Then also there is timbre as well as tonal quality to consider.The music for the opening scene is immediately ear-catching. The big 'THUUUMMMMP' is simply scary and acts as an 'anti-gong'. It is the pronouncement of our future doom. To this day, the Waldorf 'Q' series of synthesizers uses an emulation of this sound as a showcase patch.Other highlights here include:The 'Blade Runner Blues' theme - Played where a replicant woman is shot in the back and crashes through panes of glass in slow motion. The blues theme is in perfect keeping with the whole 'noir' feel and yet, in keeping with the futuristic setting, the lead is held by a synthesizer, not a saxophone.'Rachel's Song' - Although the strings and woman's voice sooth, the constant metallic 'plinking' in the background reminds you that Rachel is a machine.'Memories of Green' - This is the music played at the piano scene where Rachel remembers her implanted memories. The heavily detuned piano suggests age, but the electronic sounds in the background remind the listener that this too is not real, even if it seems so to her. This song is very Debussy-like suggesting this is what she remembers playing in her earlier memories. Subtle!'Tears in Rain' - It is Roy Batty's last scene and perhaps one of the most poignant ones on film. An uplifting theme to match the releasing of the dove into the sky and signifying the release of a soul.There are snippets of music played in various scenes that have distinctly Oriental overtones to them. Often, this music is heard echoing across the city or in other public places. This reflects the theme of an L.A. in 2019 with a meshing of Western and Oriental musical styles.I don't think Vangelis got near his due here and my hat's off to him and to Ridley Scott for having the foresight to choose him.

I am one of those people who believe that movies do not need great story line to be great. They just need to be made great!!! Blade runner is one the finest example of this. I'm not saying that story line in Blade Runner is bad, it's far from it. But I'm trying to stress that there are so many things you can enjoy in a movie, other than the plot i.e. the visuals, sound, acting, dialog and so on. And great movies should excel in all these aspects.From the very first scene the director, Ridley Scott, sets the mood with stunning visuals and sound. Immediately you are immersed in a dark, bleak, yet hypnotically beautiful world of the future. We are taken through the the story, which deals with some deep issues (which I won't go into for the benefit of those who hasn't seen this movie), in a dreamy and balletic manner. The pace is spot on and the emphasis in the movie enables you to grasp these issues while you're watching, and in the climatic finish the director leaves you with an afterthought that is both sweet and bitter.\nBlade Runner truly is movie making at its very best. It does everything right; it's visually stunning, even now after 20yrs ; acting is brilliant, especially Rutger Hauer; and it also has one of the best movie sound tracks. Dialogs between the character is sparse but it is the case of 'less is more'.Finally there is an issue of which version is better? The Original or the Directors Cut. Well I like them both and I consider them to be two quite different movies. In the directors cut the removal of the voice over and added scenes make it much heavier.

Dick.Ford is Rick Deckard, a burned out bounty hunter cop officially called a BLADE RUNNER who was charged with the job of killing cyborgs called \"replicants\", who are human like in appearance but can be built with super strength, super stamina, super everything, including super intelligence, or they can be built to be stupid. A group of replicants led by Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) has made it to Earth from an off world colony (the late Brion James as Leon, Joanna Cassidy as Zora, and a pre-Splash Daryl Hannah as Priss). Even though replicants are supposed to die after 4 years in order to keep them from copying human emotions too accurately, they still cause problems, which leads to the creation of blade runners being employed to kill them. Deckard is yanked out of retirement when the blade runner who was assigned to \"retire\" (kill) them is put on a ventilator by Leon and given orders to pick up where the other guy left off. First, however, Deckard meets Rachael (Sean Young), a replicant who doesn't even know that she's a replicant but is \"beginning to suspect\" and later has a torrid love affair with Deckard, leaving Deckard with the ethical dilemma of either killing her or hiding her.But is Deckard himself a genuine human? Hopefully not, because that would take all the sting and exoticism out of his relationship with Rachael. But you never know, he may very well be one of them, as he takes a horrible beating all throughout the film and always manages to survive.\nHarrison Ford is fine in his usual quiet demeanor, but the film is stolen from him by Rutger Hauer with his intense, off beat performance as Roy Batty, the near Christ like Replicant leader.

Apart from the hairstyles you'd be hard-pressed to know it was made in 1982.Story line slow? Only for people who are addicted to the mindless overdrama that hollywood pumps out these days. The pauses and deeply atmospheric moments in this film are part of it's overall sombre texture and thoughtful feeling. Indeed, deep themes of love and death are woven into this film noir tapestry. It's the only example that I know of a film noir set in the future, with Harrison Ford doing an outstanding job as a Philip Marlow character.The lingering scenes of the dystopic Los Angelas futurscape are stunning in their detail and verisimilitude, using extensive sets and modeling to give a texture which is all but lost with the advent of computer-generated imagery. This film is almost unparalleled in its confidence, as the long, lingering shots of the city and the buildings pay homage to an entirely imaginary architecture and cityscape which, all at the same time, seems awesome and lamentable. It's fascinating to see the filmmaker's imagination at work in the commercial aspects portrayed in this futurscape as well. Coca Cola retains its prominence, but Los Angelas has become dominated by Japanese interests and culture, a clear projection of where Japan seemed to be going in the early 1980's.Story line simple? The story line is epoch. Rutger Hower seeks immortality, or at least more mortality from the \"creator.\" But the modern god is a scientist, a geneticist who has none of the omnipotence that Hower's character needs.

First of all, the complex narrative, that develops throughout the film through different perspectives of different characters, which includes several replicants and the blade runner, wonderfully portrayed by Harrison Ford, himself. This, in my opinion, achieves a multi-layered and never biased account of what is going throughout this film as the blade runner attempts to track down these replicants. Secondly, whenever a specific sequence is made, such as Deckard's chase for the club performer or that replicant destroying its father, it is wonderfully structured as a sequence by establishing a master shot for that particular sequence by cutting in and out of the action to its master shot. Examples of this fine method of film-making is encountered with the owl being a sort of master shot when that replicant is destroying its \"father\", and the blade runner on that train and the dancer on those stairs on that chase sequence. Thirdly, one of things that are not completely conventional of a sci-fi film is that it ends in an unusual, where Rick Deckard and Rachael are going down the elevator together. This brings out one question that has not really been answered throughout this film. Was Rachael a replicant? And if the answer was no, how come she somewhat failed that test, where they answer questions to a replicant suspect? But I am glad that this film ended this way, maybe because Ridley Scott, the director behind this cinematic masterpiece, wanted to leave that question unanswered and leave that to the audience imaginations making this film somewhat thought- provoking for the audience to conclude to their assumptions. But I will not as I might not be watching or analysing the film this way to answer this question, but, at the moment, I guess she is not. But, then again, if I ever watch this sci-fi treat again, I may come to a different conclusion. Another thing that made me marvel this film was that ending sequence, where that replicant is hunting down Deckard in J.F. Sebastian's house. That whole pin in the replicant's hand really brought a disturbing exhibition of how the replicants cannot feel death, while this one wanted the ability to die. Then Deckard gets chased out of the house and on top of the roof of that building. He tries to jump over to other sides but instead is now grasping onto that girder. That low-angle shot, where Deckard is holding onto that girder over of busy city life of this futuristic cityscape, looks well composed and a very memorable shot from that whole film. This indeed does sums up the blade runner's struggle to hunt down replicants perfectly.

Ridley Scott, its director, has achieved to bring together the settings, the characters and the screenplay to create a thrilling and interesting world, in one of his greatest works.In 2019, life on Earth has become a claustrophobic and nightmarish experience, and hi-tech has been developed in dirty and congested streets. The action is set in Los Angeles and Harrison Ford plays the \"Blade Runner\" detective Deckard, an android hunter, who after his retirement is assigned to hunt down a group of androids, also known as replicants. This group, who have just rebelled against humans, arrive in Los Angeles from outer space with the purpose of finding out the reason why they all must die as well as to look for Tyrell, the owner of their manufacturer.In contrast with loads of futuristic films that are produced with a strong artificial flavour, the characters are completely believable and the dialogue is witty and natural. Furthermore, an important aspect to mention, which is one of the most striking qualities of the films, is the soundtrack. Scott has certainly scored his audience with the collaboration of Vangelis, the talented electronic music composer. But, over and above that, what is indisputable is that the aesthetics of the film are breathtaking. It is quite likely that the audience will get the feeling of reality with the dark and unique settings.However, as I see it, what puts this film in a class of its own, is its philosophical meaning. Replicants can be compared to humans, as both are looking for immortality. But, what differentiates replicants from humans is that replicants are lucky, in a certain way, to be able to demand an explanation from their creator.

Perpetual acid rain, low quality of life, and a seriously bad state of environment has led to the rich classes abandoning earth and moving to the off-world colonies. On these colonies replicants are used as slaves, replicants being engineered humans made by the Tyrell Corporation. They're physically superior to normal humans, and at least equal in intelligence. Unfortunately they're volatile too, and a Nexus 6 group of replicants goes on a murderous rampage on the colonies, and come back down to earth.This is where the story begins. Deckard is a former member of the Blade Runner unit, charged with hunting down and 'retiring' loose-cannon replicants. Brought back in on this case, because he's the best, he reluctantly finds himself drawn back into the world he wanted away from.Atmospherically Blade Runner was amazing. Neon skies, behemoth corporate buildings, constant darkness, and other forms of haunting futurisms compliment the theme supremely and make the world totally believable.The characters were excellent too - with uniformly superb performances all round from the likes of Harrison Ford, as Deckard, Sean Young as Rachel, and the unforgettable Roy Batty, played by Rutger Hauer.They made this into more than a film - it was an experience - suckered into this world we felt part of too. Ridley Scott's direction was magnificent here too, making every scene buzz with activity and ensuring the plot was always moving.In the original, the voice-overs were nauseating and obtrusive, but nonetheless they were informative and educational. The Director's Cut saw them removed, which enhanced the narrative but did make certain things less clear.There's also the ending of the original, which was removed from the Director's Cut and meant it finished at a much more poignant and meaningful moment.Truthfully you are better off seeing both movies, as you can only get the full experience that way, but just know the Director's Cut is a superior film.Overall this was an amazing film which was maybe too visionary in '82 as it was a monumental flop.

It is one of those movies you can call \"artsy\" in that respect, where a person doesn't have to answer each question with a \"yes\" or \"no\", but simply with the appropriate look, gesture, or even silence.

Every aspect of the film is executed beautifully: the production design outranks almost all sci-fi film; Cronenweth's cinematography has such great depth of field, utilizes light and shadows effectively, and subtly employs colors as markers; the matte painting and special effects outclass many of today's movies; and, the music is extremely appropriate. Given that Phillip K.

It is truly a masterpiece.There are a number of films that are regarded to be within the traditional canon of cinema. Many of them do not appeal to everyone. Similarly, many works of literature do not suit the general taste of the public, but that does not mean that they should not be read by everyone.

The scenery is just the best, in depicting a high tech but still a run down rathole LA, as we are raised to heaven at the tyrell corporations pyramid or run down abandoned buildings.

With cult status firmly behind it, the movie manages to bring together so many strands that it is interesting, thought provoking, entertaining and endearing. Harrison Ford plays the Blade Runner detective Deckard, who once again takes up his duty to retire Replicants. Early in the 21st century, the Tyrell company engineered robots that were comparable to humans in all attributes whilst also being more intelligent than us, and used as slave labour in off world colonies. The work was dangerous and often the information of the colonies would be cloudy, so it was necessary to send in robots as a test. When a particular band of robots under the umbrella of the Nexus 6 model rebelled against the humans however, they fled and came to Earth; Los Angeles to be exact. The year is 2019, and Deckard is sent to find out why the Replicants have come back to Earth and to retire them before they can blend in to the surroundings. Ford is supreme in this role and commands the stage with presence throughout. The film addresses many issues, some a little far fetched and others more believable. The latest model of Replicant is so advanced that it has started feeling emotions just like a human. To be more easily controlled, the founder of the Tyrell company implanted a \u0091history' into their minds so that they become easier to control. But the escaped Replicants fear something is wrong through their intuition that they have learned to experience. From the primary story of Ford's quest to kill these Replicants, are the other stories that blend together brilliantly. Deckard feels a pain and uneasiness about killing Replicants even if they are solely robotic. He forges a friendship with a Replicant who works at the Tyrell company and finds it difficult to communicate with her after many truths have been revealed. Rutger Hauer plays the leader of the Nexus Six brigade who seems to be on a personal quest to find out what he wants to know with his Replicant friends. Hauer is excellent, capturing the uneasy quality that we associate with anything that looks human but we know is synthetic. He plays suspense expertly, and along with Daryl Hannah creates a believable story line and triggers feelings of sadness and sorrow at their plight mixed with an uncertainty as to whether they are playing on our emotions. Ford embarks on his quest trying to fit the pieces of the jigsaw, and his roguish attractive style is perfectly suited to the movie. The backdrops are stunning and what we get is a real feel for the place. Los Angeles has become a mixture of nationalities and customs in which it is seemingly dull and dank except for the glimpses of blazing sun that basks its heat over the Tyrell building. Perhaps Tyrell thinks he has become some sort of God with the blessing of the above. The city is shrouded in steam from the Chinatown region in which stalls and market places rule. Overhead are the neon signs and lights that light up the darkened sky and factories spurn out flame after flame for production. Why would the Replicants come back to this, shouldn't they have escaped to another colony? Deckard must find out, coming up against his greatest foe yet. Armed with a Voigt Kampf testing machine, that measures impulses to decide whether the subject is human or not, and by his own judgement from working the city he must get to the bottom of the mystery. Ridley Scott has made one of the best sci-fi movies here.

I happen to think the film is brilliant, a unique insight into the future and the repercussions of what happens when we has human beings meddle with technology in the future. The film is more understated than what I thought it was going to be. Starring Harrison Ford and directed by Ridley Scott I was expecting an action packed extravaganza, but instead what we get is an old fashion science fiction detective thriller, the familiar tale of the bounty hunter looking for the bad guys. Of course like all great science fiction, what is on the outside is different to what's on the inside. In reality Blade Runner is a twisted fable, a look at what it means to be a human being, and what it means to lose that humanity when technology starts to appreciate it for itself. This leads to some of the most fantastically acted scenes in a science fiction film. He may hate the film but there is no denying that this is Harrison's best performance, the Blade Runner of the title, a man who we are led to believe may have more in common with his prey than we realize. Further adding kudos to the film is Rutger Hauer, quite possibly the finest performance in science fiction history. Whether or not his character of Roy Batty is the actual of the hero of the film is for fans to argue about (I know I have my feelings on the subject), but I dare you not to be moved by his final words as he excepts his fare after saving Dekkard.Ridley Scott shows us the versatile talent that he really is with this superb film. The direction is complimented by his unique visual style. This is one of the most visually stunning films ever made. The establishing shot is the awe-inspiring of its kind, while his portrayal of a futuristic dystopia is one of the most convincing, not to mention the most frightening, ever put to film. Presented in two versions, the director's cut is the better of the two, the voice over deleted thus not spoon feeding the narrative to the audience. The more ambiguous ending is better too, thus the cop out option of Rachael and Dekkard living happily ever after can be erased (it always put me in the mood for Kubrick's The Shining).

I come from a generation whose first experience with \"Blade Runner\" came on the various home video formats, when we were blessed to behold the 1992 director's cut of the film. The director's cut was the first version I saw, hearing horror stories of the theatrical release. Having seen both now, I can fully appreciate having the directors cut as a definitive version.\nSPOILERS AHEADHarrison Ford plays Rick Deckard, also called Blade Runner. Blade runners are insinuated to be elite police units whose job it is to hunt down \"replicants\", humanoid androids that were built by the Tyrell Corporation to serve humans. After a replicant revolt on an off-world mining colony, replicants are considered threats to society. When they are detected they are destroyed, or as the opening crawl takes pains to emphasize, 'retired'. Deckard is assigned to hunt down 5 replicants who have just escaped from an off-world colony and come to LA. His pursuit of the androids becomes an in depth exploration of what it means to be human, and chiefly why the humans can condemn the replicants for wanting to be like them.A common complaint I here from critics of \"Blade Runner\" is that it hasn't aged well. Sadly, this is a truth I have to concede. Audiences new to the feature that go into it without predetermined reverence end up laughing at the Vangelis music, dated vision of the year 2019, and sadly even Rutger Hauer's appearance in the climactic scene.\"Blade Runner\" is a beautiful movie, from the opening iconic image of future Los Angeles seemingly ablaze to the scenes of flying cars weaving in between monolithic skyscrapers beneath the perpetually raining sky.Philosophical overtones are strong throughout every aspect of the film, right down to the art-deco/neo gothic architecture of the city: the Tyrell corporation building is a gargantuan Mayan pyramid that rises about the pollution ridden cloud that cloaks the city of Los Angeles. In fact, the only time you see any sunlight in the movie is when it shares the frame with the Tyrell building. The pyramid shape of the building, the presence in the sunlight above the clouds, and the fact that it houses a creator of life (be that artificial) all convey the presence of a god figure. Indeed Tyrell's role in the movie is that of the god figure. This is unadulterated Nietzsche: god made man, and then man killed god.Differences between the original version and the director's cut are not subtle, they are glaring. The studio thought that the audience at large would need help in understanding the film, so they had Ford record an irritatingly cheesy Bogart film-noir narration. Legend has it that Ford intentionally made the narration awful in the hopes that the studio would consider it too bad to use. Also, the studio tacked on an uplifting ending in which Deckard and Rachel escape to an idyllic countryside together. One of the most interesting changes however is the \"unicorn dream\" that Scott fought to include. Its meaning is wide open to interpretation. One possibility is the connection to the title of the Philip Dick story, \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" Does Deckard's dream of an imaginary creature mean that he is in turn a fictional being? The most obvious connection is to the origami unicorn left on Deckard's doorstep at the end of the film. Does Gaff know Deckard's memories just as Deckard knew Rebecca's? Or is it a coincidence?Memories are precious to the replicants. Each one has his or her own set of memories programmed in to make them believe they have lived full, human lives. This fact is another of the many clues which led viewers to believe Deckard was in fact a replicant himself. More than that, though, it explains why Roy spares Deckard's life at the end of the film. The cheesy narration in the original release of the film explains it thusly:\n\"I don't know why he saved my life. Maybe in those last moments he loved life more than he ever had before. Not just his life, anybody's life, my life. All he'd wanted were the same answers the rest of us want.\"This is all fine and dandy if you want to take away the simplistic message that the replicants had become more human than the so called \"real humans\". The real reasoning behind Roy's grace is much more selfish. Consider the brilliant monologue he gives on the rooftop:\"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain. Time to die.\"Roy and his fellow off-worlders have 'lived' more than any of the humans living in their urban wasteland. The replicants have been programmed with a short life span. Roy accepts the inevitability of his death and realizes that the only way his memories can survive, the only evidence of his existence, is through Deckard. Roy keeps Deckard alive because the only remaining traces of his life reside in Deckard's mind.\"Blade Runner\"'s design may not have been able to withstand the test of time, but its intelligence and message are more than able to transcend the void between the 1980's and this universe.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Epitome of film as an art form", "date": "2003-10-19T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0191763"}, {"content": "Solid and near perfect science fiction thriller of a Philip K.

Blade Runner is one of three films that was adapted from a Phillip K. Dick sci-fi story. The other two films were Minority Report and Total Recall. Out of those three Minority Report is the best.

Harrison Ford is miscast here, I know they wanted to put Ford here after his two excellent performances as Han Solo in the Star Wars films, but I found him flat here. Sean Young and Daryl Hannah dont have much acting to do here, but they do an adequate job nonetheless. The standout is undeniably Rutger Hauer, who is excellent as the bad guy, he is intimidating and he steals scenes from Ford and anyother actor in the film. Nothing is more impressive here than the visuals. The Visual Effects still look fantastic, even 20 years later. The sets and the cinematography are excellent. The film has a dark film-noirish atmosphere to it. Its impossible not to be impressed by the visuals. Blade Runner is an example of style over substance.

Recently a Final Cut was issued on DVD. It restores some scenes that were taken out before to the film's detriment, but suffers also from a softening of one of the greatest lines in history. (When Roy Batty meets Dr. Tyrell, he confronts his maker with the line \"I want more life, f**ker.\" This version (and others) softens the line to \"I want more life, father.\" indicating the relationship between Roy and Tyrell. I liked it better the other way.)The story is fraught with allegory, laden with existentialism. If you try to take it too literally, you will be missing the point. It will be hard to digest the themes if you are not familiar with the writings of Descartes, Foucualt, Kierkegaard, or Nietzsche, which probably precludes the vast majority of viewers from fully appreciating the film.Blade Runner is based on the short story Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, written by the legendary Philip K. Dick, whose visionary plot-twisting epics include Total Recall (I Can Dream That For You Wholesale) and Minority Report, which was, sadly, defiled by being made into a Tom Cruise vehicle. Dick would have rolled over in his grave, since he loathed Hollywood for exactly such reasons. So why was this movie made? So a generation of lesser films would have a vast and bleak vision to imitate in countless rip-offs, take-offs, and send-ups. But none ever approach the stark and visionary brilliance of Blade Runner.Harrison Ford plays a Blade Runner, basically, an Android Hunter. A band of marauding androids, called Replicants, have violated Earth law by coming on-world. The year is 2019, and Earth is a post-apocalyptic nightmare cloaked in a perpetual drizzle and darkness. Ford is charged with hunting down the Replicants and destroying them.Now, there's too much to lay out here, but the Replicants have been preprogrammed by their makers to live only a short time. This prevents them from getting delusions of grandeur. Here is where you lose most casual observers. The Replicants represent Man, and his yearning for immortality is manifested in the angst these creatures feel at their impending doom. Why do we die? Why were we born in the first place? What is the meaning of our lives and our relationship with our creator?Now imagine that you had the chance to ask God these very things. This is exactly what happens when the lead Replicant, Roy, played by Rutger Hauer in his absolutely finest hour, meets Tyrell, the man who invented Replicants. Let's just say the meeting goes less than swimmingly, and the rage Roy feels afterward is the essence of the human struggle with the meaning and futility of life. In perfect human form, Roy literally dispenses with God and continues to search for meaning to his arbitrarily limited life.Harrison Ford famously disliked working in this film and with Ridley Scott, whose relentless demand for perfection frustrated Ford. Ford was apparently also dissatisfied with his character, whom he saw as weak. In fact, Deckert is, despite Ford's disdain for playing him, a subtle and nuanced character, fiercely conflicted, who shoots women in the back, drinks too much, and falls in love with his quarry, all the while stalking beings who only want what he wants, to live.The women in the movie are all breathtaking in their own way. Darryl Hannah is the exotic beauty, a Replicant designed, as her dossier explains, as a pleasure model. In a great example of attention to detail, her character, Pris, has an incept date of February 14, which is what one would expect for a pleasure model. Zora, played by Joanna Cassidy, is described as \"beauty and the beast\" since she is a trained killer. This duality is reflected in her dossier as well, since she is a Gemini, the perfect sign for duality. I could go on, but suffice it to say that there are endless such gems in the details.The film, with all its allusions, climaxes in the final confrontation between Deckert and Batty. It is confessional, elegiac and powerful. Batty faces his end clutching a white dove, a touch added by Rutger Hauer himself, in much the same way we consider our own souls as we face death, and if by now you haven't fully realized the ultimate allusion of the film, recall that Batty his a nail piercing his hand.The ultimate question to consider is whether Deckert himself is a Replicant, but you cannot fully weigh that question unless you watch the movie multiple times, and even then you will have to make a judgment call. It would not be characteristic of Dick to reveal any definitive answer to that question, so your answer will have to come from you as you consider your own ideas of life, existence, mortality and immortality, God, and destiny. Goodness. How could we ask more of a movie?Ridley Scott's direction melds in a miraculous synergy with Vangelis' superb, minimalist score. The result is a thought-provoking classic that raises, but doesn't quite answer, the most elemental questions of existence in a dreamland dystopia where humanity has been absorbed by its own disastrous creations. If you've never seen this movie, watch the original theatrical release with the extended footage. The commentary makes the story easier to follow, and since Dick will mess your mind like a master, most first time viewers need the commentary. (Indeed, it was added post-production, because Scott feared most viewers wouldn't understand the plot. He was right.)If you're familiar with Blade Runner, then watch the Director's Cut, or the newer Final Cut.

Some people say that it is a bleak insight to the future, but in that case, can't you give us a little insight into the characters of the replicants, instead of making them all typecast?

I was 12 when Star Wars was released, 13 when Close Encounters of the Third Kind appeared. Just as I was turning to adulthood at 17, along came this completely adult science fiction movie. Sad to say, however, in the intervening two decades, not one film has managed to handle a science fiction concept in quite so intelligent a manner. Couple the deep themes of the nature of humanity and the nature of death with Ridley Scott's absolutely inimitable visual style, Rutger Hauer's powerhouse performance as Batty and Vangelis' seminal score and this movie swiftly acquires the deserved status of a classic.That was the good. Now let us briefly examine the bad. The opening establishing shot of Los Angeles, 2019 is of course a classic of its kind. Subsequent lingering shots of futuristic buildings, however, tend to hold up the pace of the movie, often at crucial points of plot development. Apart from being unnecessary they are too long for their own good, frequently extended to allow the traverse of a supernumerary flying vehicle.In addition these shots don't display any of the brilliantly noir claustrophobic atmosphere of the dialogue scenes, so much so that they sometimes seem to have been inserted from a completely different film.The film does have its longueurs. The second act sags alarmingly while Deckard is investigating the photograph and the snake scale until finally we get some action with Zhora's retirement. Later on when he's chasing Pris, we can see that she's waiting for him in Sebastian's flat, so the lengthy shots of Deckard making his way up the Bradbury building only serve to increase impatience rather than suspense.It seems churlish to criticise Harrison Ford's performance, particularly since it at times contains some of his best work - particularly the love scene with Rachael - but for the first half of the film it is very obvious that Blade Runner is the first serious film which he has to carry on his own. There is a palpable lack of consistency in his characterisation, as if Ford hasn't decided who Deckard is, yet. In reaction to things Bryant is telling him about the new \"skin jobs\", he screws up his face in an attempt at scorn which comes across as expressing the need for some kind of reaction, but not knowing what. He apologetically calls Rachael and asks her down to the bar, and suddenly turns into the worst kind of self-regarding galoot. And the Jerry Lewis impression during the interview with Zhora - it's just *wrong*.One problem with Deckard's characterisation isn't Ford's fault at all. As the \"old Blade Runner\" with all the \"old magic\", it sometimes seems as if he's never met a replicant before. In all his retirements he leaves himself almost ludicrously open to attack, and escapes by sheer luck each time. It would have been better to demonstrate his prowess when retiring Zhora, Leon and Pris and show that he has met his match with Batty.Regarding the famed (not to say precedential) \"Director's Cut\". I know I'm in a minority amongst Blade Runner cultists, but it seems clear that in cutting the original version of the film the way they did, the studio evidently knew what they were doing. Shots of vehicles flying around the city go on for too long; Scott's battle to retain his \"Unicorn Dreams\" sequence is legendary, but having put a portion of it in, it's clear that the unicorn's \"horn\" is artificial, and it comes too early in the film for the connection with Gaff's unicorn origami figure to be evident to anyone other than die hard fans who already know what to look for. Elimination of the voice over certainly had many proponents amongst fans of the movie, not excluding myself, and of course it did have very many bad points - \"Bryant was the kind of guy who in the old days used to call black men ni**ers\" (they cut the very worst one, I had to read it in the published script: \"I've seen 'em laugh, I've seen 'em howl. I never saw one cry.\"). However, the removal of the voice over has had one rather distressing side effect - it eliminates the character of Gaff almost entirely. Without the voice over there is no indication that Gaff is after Deckard's position, and scarcely any sign that he is a Blade Runner himself until the very end of the movie. The frustrated look on Gaff's face as he observes Deckard's survival now has absolutely no context.After twenty-one years I now feel freer to express a few niggles, happy in the thought that the movie is old enough and certainly classic enough to take a little criticism. It still remains one of my all-time favourite movies, and, as a science fiction fan, one of the very very few movies to treat its genre with respect and intelligence.*2007 EDIT* News arrives of \"Blade Runner: The Final Cut\" along with the real story of what happened at the time of the Director's Cut. It seems that Ridley was actually too busy with _1492 (1992)_ (qv) to genuinely supervise the creation of BR:TDC - he simply told the studio to take off the happy ending and the voice over, and they seem to have taken him at his word but in addition thrown everything else in if they had a negative of it. The result was the movie which, in retrospect, it's hard to believe anybody could have believed Ridley Scott actually had anything to do with it. With the new version, they have apparently taken note of my comments above and have even undertaken some reshoots (with Ben Ford, Harrison Ford's son) to fix the second act flabbiness.

What is science- fiction? Is it a future world controlled by machines that involves virtual reality? e.g. The Matrix Or is it something happier, but a world rid of crime? e.g. Minority Report Could it be a world that is dark and is dominated by large skyscrapers and the streets filled with all sorts of character? Enter Blade Runner. Ridley Scott was a new comer at the time of making Blade Runner, and was also quite interested in science- fiction/ fantasy. He completed Alien a few years earlier and three years later he'd make Legend. But the real mastermind behind Blade Runner is of course Phillip K. Dick, who wrote the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Having read the novel, it would only seem fair for me to judge on both levels of an adaptation and a film alone. Harrison Ford plays Rick Deckard, a futuristic cop also known as a Blade Runner who's duty consists of hunting down robots who appear to be humans, known as Replicants. After a fellow officer is wounded and ends up in critical condition, it is Deckard's job to hunt down six deadly Replicants who killed the crew of their ship and are now lose in L.A. The year is 2017, and the world mainly consists of Asian overtones, with floating vehicles and colorful ground leveled areas. As Deckard, Ford does a noteworthy job by portraying the overall sad and tired quality of Deckard, his performance is certainly not exceptional by any means but it fits the story. On top of it all, this is the Rick Deckard from the novel. Rutger Hauer plays Roy Batty, the mysterious and dangerous leader of the Replicants, who's performance is one of dark strength yet at the same time a sort of provactive mystery. He says his lines with a curious yet commanding voice, and he is definitely the top performer in the cast. Sean Young plays Rachel, a mysterious worker of Tyrell who later becomes somewhat involved with Deckard. Also in support is Darly Hannah as the seductive but harmful Replicant Pris, and James Edward Almos as Gaff, a mysterious man who knows more about Deckard then the viewer seems to. The cast isn't exactly exceptional by all means, they don't turn in Oscar refined performances by any means but it fits the bill. Written by David Web Peoples and Hampton Fancher, the script loosley ties in with the novel but still captures the important essence of it. It's a solid script, could use a bit more attention to detail but there are some definitely remarkable lines. Ridley Scott directs with a real persistence for story and characters, and he is also the man responsible for delivering all the goods. His direction is fully realized and fully capable, painting such an illusive and enchanting vision of a nightmarish future. As an adaptation of a novel, it's not the best one ever, but is still somewhat succesful but it stands out more as film. Science fiction features like Blade Runner come in few numbers, and such beautiful and tight special effects that perfectly balance out with the story are hard to find. This is a film that should always be treasured, a gem that will stand the test of time.

Dark- possibly. It's no \"Star Wars\" or \"Indiana Jones\", and I think that so many people were expecting just that in 1982 when released. I was in 5th grade, and it was the first R-rated flick that I saw in a theatre, and I was amazed at what I saw. First, I wasn't expecting the usual bulls***-summer movie, so what was shown was a precursor to what the not-so-distant future had in store. I don't think audiences from the Y generation will much like this with their limited attention-spans. But it's astonishing with how many of Scott's \"future\" premonitions have come true: corporations owning the world; the increase of the Asian population in Los Angeles; flying police cars-- oh, maybe not that one...I just looked at this last night on DVD, and I miss the original cut. Ford's voice-over wasn't that bad. It was well-written. And I found myself reciting that missing voice-over when watching the scenes that the VO was once present. But without the voice-over, there is a surreal effect to it. It seems more eerie. And the original ending wasn't a \"pat-Hollywood ending\"-- just gave it some resolution, that's all. The new ending looks like a foreign film's. Not bad, but not all that good either.\nI think that this movie's got such a tight following because it wasn't real popular and was in fact shunned ny the critics when released. The ingredients of a cult classic! But I do not think that this was a great film, either. For one thing, Scott focuses more on the visuals and the sets rather than character development & story (something that Lucas is obsessed with in the new 'Star Wars' films). But the acting isn't bad-- Rutger Hauer is one weird-ass guy! Brion James is a true stupid replicant thug, and Daryl Hannah is great as the \"little replicant lost\" role. Joanna Cassidy is as smart as Hauer (but not anywhere near as strange) & sexy. Harrison Ford is different in every movie he's in, although he tends to overact (but never over the top) at times.

And perhaps one of the movies to really define an era of sci-fi. Almost every \"future society\" movie after it, tried to copy some of the same environment and the same type of look and feel. None succeeded. Blade Runner is basically a story of a man in doubt, in doubt of himself and his way of life. He used to be a hit-man, a so-called Blade Runner, who hunts down stray androids called \"Replicants\" and \"retire\" them. But after meeting a replicant called Kate, which has had memories implanted, causing her to develop human-like emotions, he starts to realize that what we see as the definition of \"life\" isn't really the only correct one. He is starting to get a nagging feeling that replicants aren't just any other machine. This movie is about taking a good look at how we define humanity, and how we define \"life\" itself. Is a life less worth, because it's not human and \"only\" a machine? The movie lacks a lot of story that Philip K. Dick's book has, but i still think they've managed to keep the most important parts. The excistential question is there, just as strong as in the novel, and the less important parts of the story isn't really a great loss, movie wise. The movie is also backed by one of the best movie soundtracks of all times, courtesy of Vangelis. The music really helps transmit the feel of this darkish future society.

I was glad that a writer in a film magazine agreed with me that the Director's Cut wasn't that good. I don't care what anyone else says, I stand by my decision!SPOILER WARNINGS!The performances are all very good. Rutger Hauer is a truly tragic character as Replicant leader Roy Batty. You really feel for him. His death scene is truly moving. Harrison Ford is quite good as Deckard as is Sean Young as the Replicant he falls in love with. The other Replicants aren't developed much, but I'm sure that Brion James, Daryl Hannah and Joanna Cassidy (WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT) fulfilled all that was required of them. M. Emmet Walsh and Edward James Olmos are good in their roles as the two main cops, but they too are underdeveloped. The production design has to be the best aspect of the film as the dystopian LA of the future is brought to life excellently. The film is also brilliantly underscored by Vangelis.Many people complained about Harrison Ford's voiceover in this picture, but I actually like it as it clears up some plot points and make Deckard's feelings more clear to the audience. And about all that stuff about the Unicorn Dream bit in the DC implying that Deckard may be a Replicant (which Ridley Scott revealed was true a couple of years ago). Well, it could be true, but it's implied in the original cut as well. When Sean Young asks Deckard if he ever took one of the 'Voight-Kampff' tests (tests which try to prove if you're a Replicant), he does not answer, because of course he hasn't. That, for me was an implication. I admit that I like happy endings, and the happy ending of BLADE RUNNER makes sense. Because Rachel believed herself to be human, Tyrell did not program her to terminate after four years, and the same could be said about Deckard. This, in my opinion makes sense and humanises Tyrell to some degree as it shows that he must have had some compassion for the Replicants after all.

I first saw it when I was 13 and it went completely over my head. A few years later I watched it again and it went completely over my head. Then a while after that, again, it went completely over my head.\nTen years later I wish every sci-fi film could be like it.\nBlade Runner is so brilliant because it is so \"boring\". It's not a sci-fi film out to excite with shootouts or chases or a big world-changing finale... even though it does include them. It has many concepts and ideas and characters that Ridley Scott refuses to explain and instead lets his audience decipher events and visuals with his or her own imagination... what a beautiful sentiment.It's best not to approach Blade Runner as an action-packed one-note film that starts and ends with the opening titles and closing credits, a mistake most of us have made. The trick the film-makers pull is to merely suggest the scenes that you come to expect. You're given hints about mutinies aboad slave ships and crash landings in the ocean and replicants being fried walking through electrical fields, about off-world colonies and social-political machinations too complex to ream out in tiring exposition. You'll find that 50% of Blade Runner exists in your own head, that's the gift that the makers of this film have done... they've created a universe for every viewers mind to swim in.The level of design is, in itself, a glowing testament to attention to detail. This is part of the joy of watching a Ridley Scott film. He doesn't just handsomely decorate his sets with odds-and-sods to make it look nice, his sets practically ooze character and history. Just look at J.F.Sabastian's apartment and all his self-made toys and assorted nick-knacks. Just look at the sushi-bar and its steaming heat trays and busy chefs. Just look at Chew's eye-shop and its frosted surfaces and vile, fleshy creations. You could spend an entire viewing just staring at all the different props and gadgets that lie about simply because, as previously mentioned, they could truly be for anything.Jordan Cronenweth, the sadly departed cinematographer, did his best work on Blade Runner. He has given us visual melodies in which our eyes can dance to. His favourite shot was the one where a puff of Rachel's cigarette smoke is illuminated by light whilst Deckard is interviewing her and the image dissolves to a long shot... as if the previous one was just blown away. His crowd scenes are lit by gaudy neon signs and umbrella's with florescent handles and sparkling drops of rain. One of his greatest achievements was his lighting of J.F.Sabastians apartment building, filled with constantly moving shafts of light that fill the empty, lonely spaces.\nMusic wise, for a film all about the inevitability of death and the eternal question of \"why are we here, what's it all about?\", Vangelis' score really helps you to experience and feel the dark, the rain, the cold and the loneliness of Los Angeles circa 2019 and it's sorrowful hymns will make even the most synthetic of hearts pump warm, red blood. The best of which are Rachel's song and Memories Of Green (re-used in Scott's other film Someone To Watch Over Me). It's a famous and often talked about cornerstone of synthesized harmony.But don't forget about characters. All the above images and sounds help to deepen what all the main character's feel in the film: a chronic fear of death. Whether it's Deckard constantly watching over his shoulder for danger \"quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it?\"; Rachel coming to terms with her hunted inhuman qualities \"I'm not in the business, I am the business\"; the other Replicants searching for a cure for mortality \"the light that burns twice as bright burns half as long\"; J.F.Sabastian's accelerated ageing; Bryant's illnesses (he pours Deckard two drinks simultaneously because he's too sick to drink himself, a brief nod to The Big Sleep) and Chew's slow freezing after having his protective coat ripped off. It's a story of the loneliness one feels when faced with the inevitable and his or her desperate search for a cure, something we can all relate to and will have to deal with sooner or later.It also ends without a hero. Deckard neither succeeds nor fails, he just does what Roy Batty wants him to do: understand and empathise with why he's fighting for his life and why he had to escape a life of slavery. In the end Deckard silently realises where the human race has gone wrong in inventing replicants with feelings, and why he's glad not to be one of them... whether human or replicant is up to you :)It also stands as being the most quotable sci-fi film since the Star Wars Trilogy.Keep on watching it, you'll understand in time and as mentioned by others, the book Future Noir is a great way to kick-start your interest in the film as it goes through the film scene by scene like the commentary the DVD never had.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "a haunting sci-fi experience that you will grow to love...", "date": "2003-02-16T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0191716"}, {"content": "This has been my number one movie of all time, since the first time I saw it.

Dick since before this movie was made, I initially had some problems with the movie leaving out some of the major parts of Dick's novel 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep?', most notably the total absence of Rick Deckard's wife, and the removal of the sub-plot involving Mercerism. But I have long come to terms with that and now can happily judge 'Blade Runner' as a movie in its own right, without comparing it to the brilliant novel that inspired it. As a movie, 'Blade Runner' is a stunning achievement, and to me it is still one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made. Ridley Scott is a very visually orientated director, and is often only as good as the script he is working with. In this case he was blessed with a very good one, co-written by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples (the latter went on to co-write another modern SF classic 'Twelve Monkeys'). Scott and his team manage to conjure up one of the most impressive cityscapes of the future ever seen in a science fiction film. So impressive that it knocked the socks off William Gibson, the writer who is credited with \"inventing\" virtual reality. 'Blade Runner's look had a definite influence on Gibson's seminal 'Neuromancer', and the movie must therefore be seen as a major contribution to the cyberpunk genre, which is still making waves in pop culture, just look at 'The Matrix' for one. Harrison Ford is perfectly cast as the weary and cynical Deckard, and the supporting ensemble cast are all excellent. Many of these actors (especially Rutger Hauer, cult favourite Brion James, Daryl Hannah) would rarely be given roles as good as this again. Hauer is particularly good in one of his best ever performances, which gives Blatty a depth and humanity not even seen in Dick's original story. Legendary character actor M. Emmet Walsh ('Blood Simple') and Joe Turkel, veteran of three Kubrick movies (one of only two actors to have that honor) are also worth noting, as is the superb score by Greek electronics whizz Vangelis. 'Blade Runner' is a science fiction classic, and a movie which improves with each viewing. Highly recommended, but make sure steer clear of the version originally released in cinemas with the cheesy voice over.

This version forms part of my treasured collection.Then, the \"director's cut\" was released and I did make a point of going to see that at the cinema. I have to say that I was really disappointed with this version on three counts:1. The deletion of the 'violent' bits. The film was not that violent in the first place, so why bother?;2. The insertion of the 'dream sequence' involving a unicorn. This looked so much like the editor had accidentaly slipped in a scene from 'Legend' that most of the audience burst out laughing. This was supposed to suggest that Deckard IS a replicant, linking (as it does) with Gaff's origami model that he finds at the end of the film. But there are already other subtle clues within the film (like the glow in Deckard's eyes), so why put in this gauche signpost?; and3. The loss of the voice-over. I, personally, don't mind the Marlowe-esque voice-over. Not only does it explain certain parts of the storyline, but it adds to the 'replicantness' of Deckard's character. Without the voice-over, the film becomes confusing (to the uninitiated) and the pace slows.Needless to say, I didn't bother to buy the \"director's cut\" when it was released on DVD. I'm still waiting for the original European version to be released on DVD, but this seems increasingly unlikely (Criterion have since lost their licence for this film).

Census figures are not frozen, they do change. Yes, we have the Chinese character who designs replicant eyes. But we also have white genetic experts in Sebastian, and the powerful Tyrell. Please. There's enough racism in this world already. No need to sound alarms in corners where it doesn't exist.

I feel the question of \"what does it mean to be human?\" is covered well enough with all of the other replicants.

How indeed do I know that I am human?The answers concern a complex meditation on memory, something that previous to \"Blade Runner\" had been the strict domain of filmmakers like Ingmar Bergman. BR took sci-fi film and pushed it into adult territory, just when the \"Star Wars\" revolution was threatening to turn the tide forever in favor of \"space opera\". \"Blade Runner\" brought us back to the days of the German silents (\"Metropolis\", \"Aelita\") in which a dark, uncertain future was coupled with doubts about the worth or meaning of human existence.\nThere is a lot to look at here, with beautiful photography, and inspired direction and a batch of memorable performances from the excellent supporting cast. Hauer steals the movie from the seemingly disinterested Ford, particularly in the film's stunning finale.This movie is also notable for the depth of detail that was put into its futuristic vision.

Full story told with personal comments.Blade Runner quickly captures the viewer with splendous views of a futuristic city in the not too distant future. The police come to take Deckard (Harrison Ford) into custody while he is trying to have dinner in Chinatown. The police ask Deckard to come back to the unit and track down replicants, human cyborgs, and retire them. The Blade Runner unit of the police is the group that does this task, and Deckard is soon recalled into service.Blade Runner shows off the great direction by Ridley Scott in the first section. A quick story ensues about one of the replicants and Deckard is shown a video where one of the replicants kills a Blade Runner who is trying to determine if he is a replicant or not. Deckard quickly takes the job and does some private investigating.Deckard goes to the Tyrell Corporation for a meeting with Tyrell to obtain some information about the renegade replicants to see if he can track them down. Tyrell's friend Rachael (Sean Young) introduces Deckard to him. Tyrell makes Deckard perform a replicant-positive test on Rachael to test Deckard's skills. Deckard quickly finds out she is one and tells Tyrell, he explains she is a new and improved model.As we view this section we can see there will be some future chemistry between Deckard and Rachael. This part also shows that Deckard is a hands-on kind of detective willing to go anywhere to do his job.Deckard eventually finds one of the replicants in a parlor, he chases her into Chinatown and shoots her in the back. One is down, four more to go. Quickly another replicant, the same one that killed the Blade Runner in the beginning of the film grabs Decard by the neck and is ready to crush him, but he is killed by Rachael who had been following Deckard. Deckard and Rachael go back to Deckard's apartment, Deckard tries to bring out some emotions in Rachael but learns replicants have no memories of their own and they can't fully display human emotions.The first real action sequence is intense and suprising here, a perfect mix to open up a movie. An interesting fact about Blade Runner that few people realize is that Deckard only uses a pistol to retire replicants, the chases and shootouts are fascinating without using a small arsenal of rockets and lazers so many other sci-fi's have used, this is truely impressive. One of the main hidden points is revealed here and will be very important to the story later, replicants don't have memories of their own.The surviving two replicants, one of which the leader Roy Batty and his friend have hidden out in an engineer's house who has kindly let them stay. Unknowning of their purposes, he accepts them as friends. Roy finds out this engineer works for Tyrell. Roy gets into the Tyrell building and demands \"more life\" and it is explained all replicants have a \"kill counter\" on them, which is their lifespan. He kills Tyrell and they go back to the engineer's house.Award winning cinematography from several festivals and academies are displayed here. This part of the story is a pleasure to watch. Another main point about kill counters are made here.Deckard finds out about the murder and quickly makes his way to the engineer's house. While he is searching the female replicant tries to kill Deckard. This is a heart pounding scene because the replicant has Deckard in a perfect position to break his neck, but in the nick of time Deckard turns and escapes, then he shoots her dead. These next minutes are the most suspenseful you might ever see in a movie. They are captivating, exciting, and extraordinary. Roy Batty and Deckard fight till the death in the old decrepit house where walls can be knocked down, there is nowhere to hide, it is rainy and slippery and Roy Batty has stuck a nail threw his hand as a lethal weapon. Deckard getting his ass kicked moves to the roof because that may be his only means of escape. Deckard slips and is hanging from the building. Roy comes over with little strength and helps him back up saving his life, right after this his kill counter goes off and he revrently bows towards Deckard as he dies.Why would Roy Batty want to save Deckard? There is one answer, Roy Batty only hates humans, and he wants Deckard to live.Deckard has finished his job and continues his romance with Rachael, but on the way out of his apartment he finds a oragami unicorn left by Gaff, a police officer who Deckard has talked to in the past. On his way out he hears \"It's too bad she won't live, but then again who does?\".

Its a sweet justice that this film from his book was sort of a milestone of that philosophy.It concerns a narrator whose recollection of the events may be colored. Some may have happened, some may have been manufactured memories. Within the remembered story are people who fold memories, from the fellow who manufactures replicants, to he who makes `toys,' to the fellow who literally folds. This first use of noir in scifi underscores the matter: noir denotes a coloring of the world, an implied narrator (usually but not necessarily paranoid).What makes this a watershed is that the studio bosses washed all that out of the theatrical release, making the narrator a trusted one by literally narrating. The film was a flop. With the director's reinstatement of the ambiguous truth, it has become a success. And who says the viewing public is too stupid to appreciate multilevel truths? Even people who think it is a simple story sense something deeper.Harrison Ford as a person is completely clueless about the forces that created, surround and buffet him, so he is a natural for this role, probably his best. Joanna Cassidy (Zhora) is a redhead. Great films seem to have more than their share.This camera is highly architectural. The state of the art with effects did not allow much camera movement, so all the perspectives are borrowed from Welles. So it doesn't innovate there, but the emulation is quite masterful. Where it does innovate is in the vision of an alternative (not future) world, but of course you knew that. However, it is worth noting how rare this is.The combination of knotted truths, architectural camera, effective reinstatement of alternative worlds, and the confused projection of self are completely in line with what Dick intended (if not quite what he wrote). And it is enough to place this in the top three of my best science fiction films, and on my list of must viewing for students of visual thinking.Ted's Evaluation: 4 of 4 -- Every visually literate person should experience this.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 16, "votes": 33}, "heading": "Offworld Truth", "date": "2002-11-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0191688"}, {"content": "I would really like to see Ridley Scott do another sci-fi film.

I saw it again after I read the book recently, and was again disappointed. For all the hype and critical acclaim, there's very little to recommend \"Blade Runner.\"It's based on \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep,\" by the great SF writer Philip K. Dick, and the film is a very loose adaption. That might be okay, except that they took out all the deep, interesting aspects of the book- especially the spiritual themes dealing with the futuristc religion, which is central to the novel. Guess they can't have anything to do with religion in a Hollywood film. Also, the characters are so bland. I know, that's the point, humans have been dehumanized by technology, etc. But I haven't found this to be true in rel life and it certainly isn't true in the novel. the humans are very human in the novel, concerned with being accepted by society, being loved, rising in social status, etc. And it is easier to relate to Deckard in the novel, than Deckard in the film b/c he is more like us in the novel. Also, the movie mostly ignores the animal aspect of the book (in the book most animals are extinct so if you own one it is a sigh of social status- also it is considered very wrong to eat an animal) so when the few references are made to animals, like the electronic owl or the empathy test Deckard gives, it remains unexplained.Okay, aside from taking out all the good parts of the book, it's not a good film anyway. As to it being a film noir, this is true. Stylistically it is very dark, no heros, murder plot, etc. However, the great film noirs like \"Double Indemnity,\" and \"Chinatowne\" are great because they have engaging plots, with many twists and turns. \"Blade Runner\" has a plot that can be summed up in one brief sentence.This is basically a film that puts style over substance. The cinemetography and art direction are impressive. The score by Vangelis is awesome. But there's nothing to the film except some suggestiveness that technology is bad because it dehumanizes man, and androids as \"the other\" should be accepted maybe. Of course these themes are nothing new, and the film does not present them in a fresh way, but rather within the confines of a dull film.It was a bad film, but I will say that the ending where Roy Batty makes his speech on top of the building was a great scene, surprisingly moving, especially considering that the rest of the film is so tedious.

A critically acclaimed film ( How did that happen ? ) featuring Harrison Ford during his Hans Solo years sounded like a great way to spend an evening. A brief summary is to say this film is WAY TOO BORING. I once constantly thinking \" OK, they are just laying some important plot groundwork now and I am sure that in 5 minutes some really great action is going to start \". Those 5 minutes ended up being the last 20 minutes or so of the movie. The rest of the time you get an interesting view of a 1982 director's concept of the era which we are now living in but the rest is JUST SO SLOW. As my friend who brought the DVD over was taking it back out of the player, he turned to my brother and I and said \" I'm sorry \" and that pretty much sums up how I had felt about having wasted my evening watching this film. I did learn one thing from watching this movie ( Other than IT SUCKED! ) and that is now matter how imaginative science fiction is, without a healthy dose of action you are almost doomed to boredom. Why some of these reviewers would willingly choose to watch this movie more than one time is beyond me.

Of course I like action flicks like Total Recall as much as the next guy. But I also like thinking films. This is a thinking film.\n For what it is this movie is simply amazing. Sure it isn't realistic. But I haven't found a sci-fi movie which has ever seemed plausible. Who designs buildings so darkly? Nobody would want to work or live in that. There is a reason why they try to use light colours in office buildings today. But I digress. The first 45 minutes is quite slow. But pay attention to the dialogue- its important. There isn't a lot of dialogue unfortunately. I would have liked to heard more from Edward James Olmos. But listen to the dialogue! Especially if you are watching the directors cut. You will have to figure things out for yourself. This film will not be liked by lazy thinkers. Did I mention pay attention to the dialogue? I thought so. If you expend the energy to think about the words and the images the film will simply be amazing. The suspense will be lost if you aren't following the story though. And of course the best scene in the movie is where creation meets his creator. The scene is gripping to say the least.\n I'm not big on Rutger's speech at the end. It's an average speech at best.

This wasn't helped by a film beset with behind-the-scenes problems:-a/discontent & disagreements behind the scenes between actors (primarily Harrison Ford) and director Ridley Scott.b/ the mainly US film crew not warming to the exacting & seemingly arrogant nature of the relatively inexperienced new Brit on the block, Scott.c/ the rather nervous producers & accountants realising from an early stage that this kind of movie was not going to be in the same action-fest, mega-buck-block-buster as Star Wars, but would instead take on a rather more darker, slower, morose theme coupled with an ever-increasing budget that eventually broke a film studio;d/ the intervention of the studio in forcing Scott to go for the highly controversial \"Studio Cut\" version with an upbeat but highly unlikely tacked-on ending & a rubbish overdub narrative, which totally ruined the balance of Scott's original cut until a Director's Cut was issued in 92 with a more satisfying conclusion.e/ problems with the scripts, screenplays, the screenwriters and the original author himself Philip K Dick, who wrote Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, which inspired the film.f/ the various inconsistences within the film - were there 6 replicants or only 5 when they visited Earth; the poor editing & sound; the ongoing argument as to whether Deckard himself was a replicant etc.\nBut to the film...... ...is set 20 years in the future. Colonisation of other planets has begun leaving only an underclass left to inhabit the big cities like Los Angeles, a place of continuing black rain, darkness, pollution & social bleakness.However, robots (or replicants as they're called) are in full service off-world, doing all the dangerous jobs humans don't want to do. Six of these replicants mutiny, kill people and return to Earth in search of their creator.The leader of this highly intelligent, highly dangerous band is Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer - in my opinion his best ever role) who realises that all replicants only have a 4 year life span. Roy & co. want that extended, considerably!The police are informed and bring in their top Blade Runner (Harrison Ford) to hunt and \"retire\" these renegades. And so begins 90 minutes of detective work, investigation, murder, abstract romance & intrigue.Director Ridley Scott (Alien, Gladiator, Thelma & Louise), has always been criticised for his films being all \"style over substance\". It is true to say that Blade Runner is a visually stunning masterpiece although the quality of the character-development & storyline pace is erratic & plodding to say the least.However, the film holds up very well. Those expecting something akin to Star Wars meets Raiders of the Lost Ark, will be disappointed. The action sequences are few & far between; the story is mature and therefore slow to develop. The special effects are very good & realistic although not on a par with today's CGIs, which I believe is a good thing.Harrison Ford is given a much more rounded character as Deckard the Blade Runner rather than the comic-strip hero of Raiders & Star Wars. As a consequence he finds it very difficult to offer any real depth or emotion as Deckard.The real acting honours goes to Hauer as Ford's nemesis: suitably under played but with a hint of Aerian menace and ends the film with a beautifully rendered monologue of his short life!Overall then, Blade Runner (the Director's Cut) is a superior film with only a few short comings. It's best viewed on the big screen in 70mm THX sound, but the tv compromise is nearly as good. The music by Vangelis is just SO perfect, coupled with some fine visual effects and camera work by Jordan Cronenweth, Terry Rawlings & David Snyder.There are rumours of yet another Director's Cut for 2003 based of Scott's original ideas that were latter scuppered by the studio (that forced him into churning out the first version with the \"happy ending\"); and then scuppered again with a compromise Director's Cut version, which despite of its title still wasn't Scott's original version.And then of course there is the ongoing rumour of either a sequel or prequel. A rumour that has been buzzing on the Blade Runner chatboards of the internet for years and yet nothing has yet to materialise, and hopefully it never will.Blade Runner is a cult movie that has risen from the ashes of apparent failure at the box office. Much like 2001: A Space Odyssey, it captivated a public with the darker side of science fiction, a fiction so close to our own reality that we feel more engrossed and fearful of what this film says about our dependence on cybernetics, the ecology of the planet and mad scientists no different from the Frankensteins of the past trying to tell us that the future of robotics (and human cloning in particular) will be a blessing to humanity and not a terror to be feared.Highly recommended*****/******", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "A Classic That Will Run & Run", "date": "2002-08-17T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0191670"}, {"content": "IMHO Scott should not have done a director's \"cut\".

But not only is this a fantastically deep movie, that repays your level of attention 10 fold, it is the visual masterpiece of all time.It is the common opinion that the 1992 directors cut, is the definitive vision. On face value, this may appear to be true. The dead-pan voice-over is gone, as is the 'Hollywood happy ending'. However this takes from the original vision Ridley Scott had, a vision of a classic Bogart-style detective story, set in the future. In the original 1982 cut, all of the detective story cliches are in abundance. Yellow, murky light through Venetian blinds, smoky bars and a monotone voice-over from the hero. Also, the amazing cinematography, that has become to trade mark of Blade Runner, is constantly dark and overwhelmingly moody. But in the Original cut, this dark/pessimistic view, is broken at the 'Hollywood happy ending' by a sun-drenched mountain drive, which comes like a breath of fresh air. The one instance in which the directors cut surpasses the Original cut, is the inclusion of the famous 'Unicorn Dream', which was the main clue to Deckard being a replicant. If this dream sequence was inserted into the original cut, a movie so perfect would be created, that it would rival 'Shichinin No Samurai' as the most flawless movie ever made.So, for the record, Deckard is a replicant, and the directors cut is not nearly as good as the Original.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Sexier Than Star Wars, Deeper Than 2001 A Space Odyssey.....", "date": "2002-07-31T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0191663"}, {"content": "I consider myself somewhat of a movie buff, and several of my friends had highly recommended this movie to me.

I watched this film in my film-as-literature class, and it shocked me. As most viewers pointed out, this is one of the few movies that raises the questions not about entertainment or the society, but the very base of the human. Compare to the ending scene of Roy saving Deck, I found the theme of the movie being revealed in another way in the scene of Thora cracking through the windows. Deck shoots Thora three times: the first shot brings Thora through the windows--the invisible wall between humans and replicants, which, in some sense, only exists in men's mind. After all, running from death and fear--aren't those the emotions that distinguish a human from a replicant? After the second shot, we have the overlapping image of Thora and the background. I don't know what others feel about it, but Thora looks like an angel to me in this image. She flies, with her transparent wings, until she falls. \"Fiery the angels fall...\" Doesn't this quote of Roy's correspond to Thora? The third shot is a little ambiguous to me. Thora crackes into a snowing room...what does snow represent here? Purity? Despair? Bleak truth of death? I prefer the last conjecture though. Finally Thora dies, and her blood streams on the snow. Blood--vitality, hope, life--life! Do you feel that she's a replicant--a nonhuman, when you see her blood? I certainly don't. Like Deck says, \"shooting a woman on the back\", she is a WOMAN, not a female replicant. Roy has been credited by many viewers as the true hero of the movie, and I agree. He \"burns so very, very brightly\", like Tyrel says, that he is above all other characters--humans or replicants, in the sense of humanity.

There were too many mistakes and inconsistencies throughout the movie, the movie had many slow spots and few action scenes, and I felt that there were many missed oprotunities the film did not take full advantage of. After reading a book on the film I realized that many incredible scenes and ideas were never filmed for a number of different reasons. I have for a long time believed that if they would have included some of these scenes the film would have been much better.However, all of my previous thoughts have changed due to a recent viewing of the film. While yes, there are many slow spots in the film I am no longer bored by them. Instead I find the film almost hypnotic because of its slow, leisurely pace. The lack of action scenes isn't a big deal either, if I wanted an action heavy sci-fi film I would see The Fifth Element or the Star Wars films, which are also good in their own right.The mistakes that run rampant through the film also no longer bother me. I always thought that the mistakes in the movie were always distracting but I no longer feel that way now. I realize that no film can be perfect and I no longer care if Joanna Cassidy's stunt double looks nothing like her or that you can see the wires lifting the spinner car.I have decided that I no longer care that those deleted scenes were not included.

Don't get me wrong I love \"Popcorn\" movies as well as the next guy but man does not live by popcorn alone. Most movies, to use anologies found in the literary world, are akin to pulp novellas, comic books, or just basic fiction, however some movies like some literary works transcend the boundaries of conventionality to a significant enough level of greatness so as to achieve iconic status. These works seem to breathe, live and pulse with a life all their own and they often give no quarter, the viewer/reader must work and read between the lines to gleem the full impact of what is intended, for the artist to plainly state what he/she is trying to say would detract from the overall beauty of the entire work. >>>>Spoiler>>>>> as an example look at one of the last scenes. You don't have to hear Deckard's voice telling you that he beilieves Roy saved him because in his last moment of life, life must have become precious to him, the act itself finaly makes obvious that Roy was never really a simple minded cold blooded killer, he killed only to escape, and then like man, destroy his own creator(s) (I could go on about that but then I'd have to analyze everything and there is just too much to this film to do that at one sitting),once Roy realised death was iminent and nothing further could be gained he allowed his more humane side to do the right thing and in the act possibly transform the real cold blooded killer (Deckard) into a humane being himself. The entire film is loaded to the gils with material such as this. You give them eyes but they cannot see>>> speaking of eyes>>> At certain points in the film every thing identified as a replicant has red eye, I never noticed this because I had always seen it on vhs and it was not always apparant. Then I saw it on the big screen and thought how could such a visual artist and perfectionist like Scott allow that to happen? Then I caught on that it was only replicants. I knew that there was speculation that Deckard himself may be a replicant and there they were in one of the scenes in his apartment:Deckard's Red Eyes although for Harrison Ford the effect was much more subtle but it was still unmistakable. Added to the other evidence, there is no mistaking it, Deckard is a replicant which leads to more thoughtful speculation.

It is, at its core, about humanity, with our empathy for a being that is not human becoming part of the story's power. It follows the classic noir form but is amazingly set in the future, blending the two genres so seamlessly and poetically it sometimes scares me to look upon its perfection. Yes, it's pacing is slightly more conservative than most sci-fi movies, which are all explosions and space-chases, but if you understand its underlying themes and you consider yourself an existentialist in even the smallest sense, you will fall in love with the story and its characters and the movie will become one of your favorites too--instantly.It is not easy to tell at first that Deckard (in Scott's intended version, the director's cut) is a replicant. When the movie tested in the U.S., test audiences were upset by this. They wanted him to be human because they felt for him. What these American audiences (just like us Americans to miss the crux of the issue, isn't it?) failed to understand was this: the whole point of Philip K. Dick's novel (DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP, on which BLADE RUNNER is based) is that Deckard is NOT human- but we feel for him anyway. This raises the questions: what does it mean to be \"real?\" to be \"human?' and to \"feel?\"For those who still want to cling to Deckard's humanity, consider this: why would the government send a human to hunt down hyper-intelligent replicants with the strength of ten men, and if he was human, wouldn't Zhora or Pris's strikes to his head crushed it if his skull was made of real bone?The thing that gets to me the most is Rachel. She is different--as is Deckard-- from all the other replicants. But does she have the 4-year lifespan, or will they live happily ever after? You've gotta give it up for robot love.The simple fact that Ridley Scott can make you feel so deeply for a couple of machines and plant a seed of hope into a dismal, dark future is amazing.

Blade Runner is a true cinema classic, not a box office success and not taken too well on its original release but it has since become a cult classic, critically acclaimed and in 90 percent of movies buffs top five movies. The film has spawned countless imitations of its dank futuristic world but the imagary has never been bettered, it has also created a debate that has run since it first hit the screens in 82, that debate being `is Deckard a replicant?', this has never been answered and I doubt ever will, Harrison Ford says one thing and Ridley says another. The film itself is pure brilliance, the visuals are striking, this film is certainly before its time and the special effects even now look top draw. The imagery created is exceptional with the futuristic world leaving you tongue protrudingly engrossed. As well as the visuals the plot is quite good too. Deckard, played by Harrison Ford, is a Blade Runner, a sort of cop/bounty hunter who hunts down beings known as replicants and kills them. The replicants were created to serve us but a small group in an outworld colony go bezerk and start killing humans, this means that all Replicants must be destroyed. The story has elements that obviously inspired the Terminator films and while some people call Arnie the ultimate cyborg I have to say for me Rutger Hauer is the ultimate bad guy in the artificial human category. This film launched him to cult status, he steals the show here as he has in other stand out bad guy performances in Nighthawks and the Hitcher. Hauer exudes an evil charisma in this film as the leader of a small group of murderous replicants, Roy Batty. Hauer really is chilling at times and he has an intimidating presence on screen, his lines are classic including the legendary tears in the rain speech at the end, which Hauer himself wrote. The other actors are very good, Harrison Ford is at the top of his form as Deckard and the two gorgeous ladies Daryll Hannah and Sean Young are also good.

I just watched it again a few minutes ago, and I thought I'd give another point of view to add to the ones already given.Blade Runner is a visual feast that is a treat to watch even in our present day CG crazed world. The realism of the sets and the overall mood helps make the cyberpunk world come to life in a way no other movie has been able to duplicate. It's hard to believe that 20 years has passed.But watching the Director's Cut again for the fourth time, I realize that I enjoy the original version better. Being a fan of old detective stories like the Maltese Falcon I really enjoyed the commentary by Deckard. His voice over actually adds something to his character that is needed. Strange that without it the movies \"feels\" entirely different. I only hope that in the future Warner Bros. releases the original version on DVD and allow the consumer to decide which version they prefer.Even without the commentary, the story still stands on its own. The plight of Roy and Decard and their battle to define what it means to be \"human\" works well within the confines of the story. The monologue at the end when Roy is dying on the roof is probably one of my favorite scenes in the movie, but the added commentary by Deckard in the original makes the scene more powerful in my eyes, because we can relate to Deckard and how he feels about the whole thing. His actions afterwards makes more sense.I've read lots of comments on this movie, and I guess no one is ever going to agree on the classic status. A shame really, because though it isn't perfect, Blade Runner is one of the best realizations of what cyberpunk really is all about. It should be viewed for that reason alone.

It's a movie with universal appeal. But the really intriguing question is, Why? What makes us want to watch it again and again? I think that Blade Runner's universal appeal lies in its ability to tap powerfully into our collective mythological subconscious: in particular, its reification of two fundamental psychic forces, represented in Greek mythology by Gaia (mother earth) and Ouranos (father sky). It has the power of a religious truth that bears repeating over and over. \nConsider the warm, dark, moist, dank feel of the film. Wet and warm and dark, one feels the feminine energy of the womb. The architecture is massive and heavy, suggesting feminine emotional centeredness, power, and gravity. In one scene, there are supporting beams of enormous girth, stretching proudly upward from the ground. But they are literally engulfed by their dark moist surroundings, and the energy of their strength and girth upward thrust seem puny by comparison. Blade Runner has a distinctly vaginal setting, an amazingly powerful backdrop to all the masculine energy that ensues. All the men in Blade Runner interact with artifacts. None of them is aware of the warm smell of the earth; nor are they intimately connected to her (the earth) as son to mother. Instead, they interact with each other, or things. Men treat other men as things. They no longer need women for procreation. They no longer need to relate to their own feminine anima (at least, they think they don't need to): they need, or they think they need, their toys, their instruments of power and control. Notice also that the act of creation has been usurped from women, residing also, perhaps primarily, in men's hands. In the Hebrew Scriptures, there was always the divine `wisdom' or `Sophia' in the background with Yahweh, identical to the creative impulse of Yahweh. In the Biblical proverbs, she speaks and says that `when he marked out the foundations of the earth, then I was with him, as a master workman.' Creation was a feminine impulse. But while watching Blade Runner, it feels as though men are acting out of envy of women \u0096 call it `vaginal envy' as opposed to Freud's `penis envy' \u0096 and an impulse both to dominate, and even exceed, women's creative powers. In Blade Runner, it's a masculine psychosis on a worldwide scale. \nWhich is why Blade Runner is such a timely tragedy about the consequences of male phallic dominance. `Blade' is, of course, a highly phallic symbol. One is reminded of Odysseus's famous encounter with Circe, two polarized representatives of the feminine and masculine, Gaia and Ouranos, wherein they approach each other in a competitive relationship. One or the other is bound to lose. In fact, both do: they remain polarized in their sex roles, and forfeit much of their human potential. So Hermes, helping he hero dominate and control the woman, gave Odysseus this advice just before his encounter with the seductress:When she turns cruel, coming near With her long stick to whip you out of doors, Then let your cutting blade appear, Let instant death upon it shine, And she will cower and yield her bed.A blade is the instrument of Odysseus's domination. Yet behind this masculine `need' to dominate lay his fear of castration, and his fear of women's creative power. Man must control the blade, the power, or the evil woman will take away his manhood. The male fear of castration is, in fact, a powerfully effective undercurrent in the film. The replicants, who are in many respects superior to their human creators, are nevertheless dissatisfied with the nature that their human creators gave them; so, they seek to deny mankind their power of creation. They want to castrate mankind as Saturn castrated Ouranos. There isn't a clear ray of sunshine in the entire film. Why? Because man is his own sun. By the light of his own intellect and reason he has seen things that ancient Helios hasn't seen. Man has eclipsed the sun as Saturn of Greek mythology (father of Zeus) eclipsed his father Ouranos. As a human audience, we feel the power and hope of such divine power. We even feel sympathy for the Eldon Tyrell, master replicant designer, when Roy squishes his head between his hands, going straight for the creative genius of his maker, the source of his generative power. It's a beautiful thing, after all, to have such creative power.So in Blade Runner, man lives in the shadow of his own image. Having externalized the creative power of his own feminine anima onto the things he has made, he remains disconnected from himself, existing on a lower moral plane than his own creation, the replicants, who, though dissatisfied with their own nature, at least remain true to it. In fact, mankind is the aggressor in human-replicant relations, having projected their own dark side onto them, not unlike Yahweh and his faithful servant Job. \nThus Blade Runner is much more than a science fiction flick. Jung said that `One doesn't become enlightened by imagining figures of light, but by making the darkness conscious.\" Blade Runner brings the darkness of our own phallic assumptions about human progress to light. And seeing our dark impulses in the light of day, we become enlightened.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Science fiction as creative mythology", "date": "2002-04-19T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0191563"}, {"content": "I've seen Blade Runner many, many times. It may hold the record for Most Times I Have Seen a Movie I Don't Actually Like. Like most people, I admire the look of the film. I don't know that I appreciate the look as much as others; while I admit it was very influential on the look of subsequent movies, its style-over-substance nature has also been influential, and I don't think that's a good thing. And, again like most people, I am intrigued by the subject matter (what is human?).That's about it for the things I like. As for what I don't like, well, first off, I'm one of those Philip K. Dick fans. There is a lot more going on in the book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? than shows up in the movie (and yes, I know that's the standard complaint of book lovers, but it's true here). The most important missing element in the movie is \"Mercerism,\" a semi-religion that is v.important in the book's philosophy. In any event, I don't think Blade Runner does a good job of getting at much essential Dickworld. For me, the best example of that world on film remains the scene in Total Recall when the bad guys try to convince Arnold in the hotel room that he is actually sitting back home in a chair enjoying a virtual, rather than real, experience.As for the non-Dickian aspects of the movie, well, if you've heard from the legions of Blade Runner fans what a classic it is, you'll likely be surprised on first viewing to find out that it's kinda boring. Apparently to help make the point that the emotional lives of humans and replicants are too similar to tell apart, director Ridley Scott instructs the actors playing humans (or supposed humans) to underplay, to make them seem more mechanical, then lets King of the Replicants Rutger Hauer overact oddly, as if he was a leftover from Kubrick's Clockwork Orange (another so-called classic with crappy acting from everyone not named Malcolm McDowell). I guess Hauer's bogus emoting is supposed to make him seem more human than the humans, but this is only true if humans are scenery-chewers.Ultimately, it's hard to care about any of the characters in the film. I suppose that could be one of the \"points\" it's trying to make; I suspect it's more what happens when you cast dull-as-nails Sean Young in a leading role. Again, I'm aware that this distancing-from-humanity feel could be on purpose. That doesn't make it any more enjoyable. The movie gets everything right except the people.

Set in 2019, the movie adopts its own unique \"retro-future\" type look that has been horribly imitated by countless video games and movies since. There's a constant gloominess, dankness, and wetness to the movie, all superbly captured by Jordan Cronenweth. All the buildings, cars, et cetera have a run-down grimy feel to them. The place is so atmospheric, and well done that the setting feels *real*, which adds immensely to the flavour of the movie. The plot is, at it's core, a good guy-chasing-bad-guy but it's done a little better than that. It's nice to see a plot that can move at times without spelling everything out to the audience (as happens nowdays), and be engaging. Some may complain about the pacing, but the slowness of it is in keeping with the drab nature of the future they live in, and the beauty of it prevents you getting bored. The plot builds to a somewhat fizzled out climax, but even the climatic fight can be reconciled with the themes of the movie. The Director's Cut, which I saw, also leaves a question about Deckard, the lead, on your lips that's thought provoking.The themes of the movie - what it is to be human - are generally well explored. It's interesting that no-one bats an eyelid about gunning down a replicant, who - despite a developed mind - doesn't warrant a right to life. Deckard, in pursuing these people, learns to re-examine his pre-conceptions about replicants and their nature, and where emotions and dreams stem from. The clues left about Deckard, and his own life, further help explore this concept. The acting performances are generally low-key, almost dead-pan, but again it suits the mood of the picture though doesn't necessarily deserve any Oscar nominations.\"Blade Runner\" is a high quality, thought provoking sci-fi movie. It's got a soul because it has something to say. It looks amazing, and still remains undated (an achievement in itself - Ridley Scott did something similar with the grungey future espoused in \"Alien\"). It's got a plot and intelligence (the viewers are left with something to question). It's among the very very best of it's genre and it's highly recommended. 9.3/10.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "All-time great atmospheric sci-fi", "date": "2002-03-11T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0191553"}, {"content": "If anyone asks me to name a dirty movie, I always think of Blade Runner first.

The director's cut is the recommended one to see as it omits a somewhat distracting narration and avoids an unnecessary Hollywood-style ending that is at odds with the rest of the film's tone.A true science fiction story or film is about ideas, not spaceship battles, futuristic gadgets, or weird creatures. \"Blade Runner\" fully qualifies as this in its examination of the impact of technology on human society, existence, and the very nature of humanity itself. These themes are set in a fairly basic detective story that moves slowly but gradually builds power as the viewer is immersed in a dystopian futuristic Los Angeles.Harrison Ford fans accustomed to the normally dynamic roles that he plays may be dissatisfied with the seemingly lifeless lead character that he portrays here as the replicant-hunting detective known as a \"blade runner\". They should be, for this dissatisfaction is part of the film experience, part of the dehumanized existence in the story's setting. However, as the story unfolds, we see Ford's character, Rick Deckard, slowly come alive again and recover some humanity while pursing four escaped replicants.The replicants, genetically-engineered human cyborgs, that Deckard must hunt down and kill are in many ways more alive than Deckard himself initially. Their escape from an off-world colony has an explicit self-directed purpose, whereas Deckard's life appears to have none other than his job, one that he has tried to give up. By some standards, Deckard and the replicants have thin character development. However, this is a deeply thematic and philosophical film, and as such the characters are the tools of the story's themes. Each character reflects some aspect of humanity or human existence, but they lack others, for each is broken in ways that reflect the broken society in which they live and were conceived/created.There are several dramatic moments involving life-and-death struggles, but most of these are more subdued than in a normal detective story plot. The film's power is chiefly derived through its stunning visual imagery of a dark futuristic cityscape and its philosophical themes.Among the themes explored are the following: - The dehumanization of people through a society shaped by technological and capitalistic excess. - The roles of creator and creation, their mutual enslavement, and their role reversal, i.e., the creation's triumph over its creator. - The nature of humanity itself: emotions, memory, purpose, desire, cruelty, technological mastery of environment and universe, mortality, death, and more. - Personal identity and self-awareness. - The meaning of existence.If you are not someone who naturally enjoys contemplating such themes, the film's brilliance may be lost on you. The climax involves a soliloquy that brings many of the themes together in a simple yet wonderfully poetic way. Anyone who \"gets\" the film should be moved by this; others will sadly miss the point and may prefer watching some mindless action flick instead.\"Blade Runner\" is a masterpiece that deserves recognition and long remembrance in film history.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 831, "votes": 1}, "heading": "A compelling, thematically-deep SF film", "date": "2002-03-05T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0191548"}, {"content": "Note: This review is, needless to say, for the Director's Cut.\"Blade Runner\" has always been hailed positively as one of the most visually creative movies ever made.

Ridley Scott with the aid of a brilliant crew (director of photography , SFX team and a decent music score) managed to shoot one of the most astonishingly impressive films ever but with a thin paper plot and an unnecessarily slow pace . It could as well be a short film. As it is it's just a 40 minutes story stretched to a 2 hours time slot .First the positive points : Blade Runner gives an original and splendid mix of stylistic themes . It combines the film noir atmosphere of the 1940 's (the detective who \"falls for the wrong woman\" , the clouded alley streets etc) with futuristic sets (flying cars , colourful lights , advanced computer technology) and strangely it maintains the present day reality of a detective thriller of the 80 's or even the 90 's . The result is a wonderful surrealistic background , timeless and not at all dated . This diachronic atmosphere is a very successful depiction of the vision of many famous sci-fi writers , and I am not referring necessarily to Philip Dick . Sci - fi writers usually describe futuristic societies with an amalgam of elements from different historic periods and this is exactly the case with this film . I will have to shake hands with the SFX crew because the overhead take in the beginning of the movie where we get a panoramic view of the colourful-lighted scyscrapers is unbelievably good . Even now , 20 years later , when technology has evolved so much , I still haven 't seen such a convincing simulated image in a movie . For example Judge Dredd (1995) and Fifth Element (1997) tried to walk on the same path but with limited success . But the real kudos must go to the cinematographer because his work is in one word excellent . The cinematography is simply excellent and I doubt if it will be ever topped . It is the soul of the movie and the most representative sample of the spirit the film-makers tried to capture . Unfortunately due to a lame script they failed . Which leads us to the negative points : slight spoilers coming .This film tries to be philosophical and mind intriguing but it simply doesn 't work . The silence and the slow pace add nothing to the film . No , the film doesn 't pose metaphysic questions about the essence of life and the borders between artificial intelligence and real existence , as the fans and the snobbish critics insist (keep in mind that back in the 1982 they panned it) . The only controversial scene is when Dechard(Harrison Ford) shoots down the dancer Zhora played by Joanna Cassidy. This is a violent bloody murder and one of them most depressing killing scenes in cinematic history . It is obvious that the \"termination\" of a replicant is still homicide of an intelligent entity . If the rest of the film managed to retain the same climate it would indeed be \"philosophic\" . Unfortunately we have a letdown to scattered scenes of erotic hypnotized innuendo between Dechard and Rachael and inane sleepy dialogue between Roy (Rutger Hauer) and Pris(the unrecognizable Daryl Hannah). All this leads to a disappointing anti-climactic finale . No , it is not at all poetic and if the idea was good *******spoiler**** Roy ultimately saving Decard******* the execution was horrible . I believe the main problem of the film was the acting . Although the casting was successful none of the actors gave a memorable performance . They all sleep-walked through their roles except from the a** kicking Cassidy . Now I reckon they were supposed to be deadpan to fit in the film noir climate but it didn 't take . Although Ford was likeable in his short haircut and had a weird chemistry with Sean Young they didn 't capture the viewer 's heart to the point they should . The ONLY character you root for is actually Sebastian (William Sanderson) who suffers from untimely anility at the age of 25 and hosts the replicants in his house. He is terrified of what is happening but can 't do anything to prevent it. I haven 't read the novel but I have downloaded the original screenplay and there are differences which would have made a slightly better film *********SPOILERS read at your own risk*****************1) The truth test to certify if Rachael was a replicant was quite longer e.g. it contained the lines \"What would you do if a wasp landed on your hand\" \"I would slap it and kill it\"2) There was another replicant called Mary who lived with Roy and Pris in Sebastian 's house . She was dispatced easily before Pris jumps -literally- on Dechard . She had about 5 lines throughout the whole film so she was easily omitted .3) The scene in the bar where Decart meets the replicant was also longer. The replicant had cockroaches for pets and he urged Ford to kiss one of them ! Ultimately Deckard was the one who shot the replicant and not Rachael.4) Roy didn 't only kill his creator scientist but also all his assistants and his family including his cute little 8 year old son . Sebastian actually was not murdered by him in that incident but unfortunately he inevitably bited the dust in the finale by the stray bullets from Dechart who gatecrashed Sebastian 's home .5) The final duel between Roy - Dechart was actually a more successful shoot 'em up scene than those dreadfully sophomoric lines by Rutger Hauer who broke two fingers of Ford and suddenly he stopped for no apparent reason wanting pretentiously to show the supremacy of the replicants to the humble human kind . ****************************************************************** I cannot understand why everyone bashed the film 's happy ending and said it left unanswered questions . If you want to know the original script had the two leads go to a snowy forest . Dechart leaves and Rachael commits suicide with a gun since this was their common decision as the best solution !!!! The movie would end with a voice-over narration from Ford \" I was glad because now they wouldn 't be able to set their hands upon her \" (and harm her) . Would you prefer THAT ??? As i said impressive eye candy is not enough for a good film . BR is a landmark but just like the case with the horrible dull \"Alien\" (at least BR is watchable) a groundbreaking \"classic\" is not always a good movie . All in all a rather disappointing7.5 / 10Don 't expect much of a story and you will like it . Oh , I almost forgot *****spoiler****** Dechart IS a replicant . In the middle of the film in his house when he talks with Rachael , Rachael 's red-shine in the eyes is shown and then Dechard 's eyes come to screen and indisputably the same red shine is CLEARLY VISIBLE**************", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 7, "votes": 15}, "heading": "Good visuals don 't make a good movie", "date": "2002-02-28T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0191545"}, {"content": "I enjoy this film for the sets, the dialogue, the mixture of light and dark, and the performance of Harrison and Hower.

The plot is loosely based on a short story by Philip K Dick, often called Dostoyevski of the SF field. It's about an android hunter who is called back from retirement to track down and kill dangerous runaway androids. As he finds and kills them he becomes more and more aware of their struggle to be human, of their yearning for life that can never be fulfilled. They kill their maker when they learn that they can only live a few short years; that they can never be one of us. In the final scene the hunter (Harrison Ford in one of his best roles) finally understands that in their short lives the androids had become more human than humans; that they value life more than us. That's why he was hired to liquidate them. With this film Ridley Scott proved that he is more than just a skilled moviemaker - he is an artist. Sadly, true art is usually noticed and appreciated only many, many years after its creation and it pays little. The movie has an incredible atmosphere. It may not be for everybody. If you are looking for an action flick with lots of explosions then watch \"Commando\" or other trash like that, or, better still, pour gasoline on your car and set it on fire - there will be a nice explosion and great sound effects (and if that's not enough there is the neighbor's car).

Is it the studio version, with its Phillip Marlow-esque narration and it's tacked on \"Hollywood\" ending. Or is it the supposed \"Director's Cut\" with narration missing, the unicorn dream sequence and the \"what the hell\" ending... Personally, I don't know because personally I've never really \"got\" Blade Runner. I'll be the first to point out the ground-breaking visuals and the un-rivalled special effects that still stand-up to this day, but I've never \"got\" the film because I just can't buy into the central concept of a cop who, in the words of Rutger Hauer \"Mopes around then f**ks a refrigerator\", ok, that may be completely miss-quoted but you get what he was trying to say.Deckard, the character portrayed by Harrison Ford is perhaps the most useless cinematic detective ever seen, not only is he slower than a bus on a motorway (if you've been stuck behind one you'll know what I mean) but he gets beaten-up by almost every one of the Replicants. He never seems to grasp the notion that these \"people\" are dangerous and perhaps he should tread carefully, instead he barges in playing it cool and ends up getting his ass kicked at every turn. Now the main reason Blade Runner left me cold (replicant sexual-politics aside of course) is the questions it raises and it's failure to give a proper answer to them. The \"what the hell\" ending I mentioned whilst talking about Ridley Scott's infamous director's cut refers to the fact that we only get half the interpretation.Okay, so Deckard dreams of a unicorn, possibly one of the implanted memories that could answer the question as to weather he IS a replicant, this is THE question that gets film-geeks more excited than any other in the annals of movie history. If Deckard is a replicant then why would Tyrell implant the memory of a unicorn, I mean a Unicorn for heavens sake, why not say a family dinner or his first date, something that would make Deckard believe he was human and leave him with no doubt about it. I mean a Unicorn; it couldn't have been more obvious if they'd put it on one of the huge neon billboards that hover above the L.A. skyline, \"Deckard is a Replicant\". But Deckard isn't the only character that fails to win me over.With the exception of Hauer's Batty, none of the replicants register, we don't care about them, and if they are such all-knowing works of technology then how come they're such morons, not a one of them has the sense they where programmed with (then again Tyrell was probably too busy planting memories of unicorns or bike riding monkeys to give them any brains or common sense). The world of Blade Runner is a cold, harsh and un-feeling world, a world of constant rain and darkness where people move about the multi-cultural landscape without uttering a word to anyone else (no wonder Deckard's represses). It's this vision of a crumbling old/new metropolis that makes Blade Runner what it is, but whereas the special effects haven't dated, the use of neon lights and pitch black framing would become the main visual staple for every early nineties music video and TV commercial. This becomes such an annoyance that at times we expect to see a \"Nike\" logo supperimposed on the screen.The dialog shoots for profundity, but smacks of pretension, and even if the final battle between Batty and Deckard is very exciting the whole thing just stops, as if the battles behind the scenes had resulted in Ridley getting bored and just going home. I would like to hail Blade Runner as the classic most people make it out to be, but I just don't \"get\" it, and as for Deckard, how can you call the character a hero, when the only reason he survives the ordeal is because Batty lets him.

It came across as a really sinister and bleak sci-fi movie at the time. I enjoyed it as a young kid, but guess I didn't really understand fully the themes behind the movie. I saw the vastly superior and definitive Directors Cut many years later and I instantly rated it as one of the best movies ever. And this is why:To fully understand how good this movie is, you have to put it into the context of it's era. When it was released it broke new ground and became what is still up to this day an unrivaled benchmark in sci-fi cinema.It was the first film to depict with such lavish splendor the nightmarish vision of future Earth. Set in post apocalyptic Los Angeles, the film tells the tale of Deckard (Harrison Ford), a semi retired cop who is persuaded back into his role of a Blade Runner (special units trained to identify and kill outlawed androids, or \"replicants\", who illegally return to Earth). His task is to hunt and destroy a band of off-world androids, led by Rutger Hauer, who fight their way back to Earth to confront their maker, the ingenious Tyrell, head of the monstrous Tyrell Corporation.The film is dark and broody. The photography is exquisite throughout and Vangelis' musical score is a now a classic masterpiece in itself. Director Ridley Scott's melancholy vision is so stylish and smooth that the film is able to emerse you into its chilling future world from the very first shot. Visually, this is one of the most gorgeous films I've seen.Deckard's character is similar to that of a film noir private detective. He comes across as a somewhat washed up and helpless soul lost in the polluted rat race. This film provides Rutger Hauer with his defining moment on film, a role I think he has failed to live up to since. With his fellow replicants, he seeks answers that only his creator can provide - all replicants all built with a lifespan of only four years and they are determined that their fate can be altered.The reason the film is so popular is that it asks so many probing questions which, in 20 years of movies since the film came out, have rarely been asked since.The themes look at humanity and the meaning and life. Should we really create \"people\" and choose their fate and mortality? If we choose to play god then we must be answerable to those who we create. Is there any real difference between life created naturally and that in a laboratory? And so do we really now what we are? Or why we are? Or who created us?The film is inspired by the Philip K Dick novel \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" Although this movie introduced me to reading countless Dick novels, I've deliberately resisted reading this one. Consequently, I can't comment on how it compares although I know the book is substantially different in places.The movie is quite slow paced, although \"smooth\" is a better word. Die hard action fanatics might not like this film although sci-fi lovers will embrace it instantly. In the current age of computer generated effects this film is looking only very slightly dated, but that shouldn't put people off.

This was the era where Harrison Ford was Indiana Jones and Han Solo (those were pretty good movies, though), and it was nice to see a change in pace for the incredibly skilled actor. I thought Harrison Ford did a great job, just because he was an entertaining as well as believable character. I thought Rutger Haur stole the movie, though. Roy Batty was such an interesting character, and Rutger Haur did a great job in animating him to real life. Batty was also a great character because he had feelings and emotions, even though he is a murderous Nexus 6, which is the most superior model of Replicants. He had an interesting sense of humor (he could be pretty funny at parts), and he also developed strong emotions. The ending was my favorite part for many reasons, but most of all for Roy's final monologue.Sean Young and Dearl Hannah (especially Dearl Hannah, and her cool face painting)were also very pleasing in Blade Runner. This movie is great for many reasons, for the great action scenes, for the great acting and dialogue, the bleak waste land of what has become Los Angeles in 2019, and also, and probably most importantly, the philosophical message the film provides us with in the end.Blade Runner is fun for everyone, except people who can't handle even a little violence (it's pretty brief). Ridley Scott usually makes great decisions on movies, which generally turn into hits, and this one is no exception (a great follow up to 'Alien').

Science Fiction always deal more with the human side of science and this one not only creatively done that. It was a sociological expose of a dystopian society (the end spectrum of Orwellian '1984' where instead of a regulated dictatorship of big brother, we have the anarchy of the capitalist corporate power above anything else) and where a moral apotheosis was asked: where does humanity lies?The film is about a group of androids, wanting to prolong their existence they went to Los Angeles, as androids had a redundancy period of four years. But Harisson Ford plays as Rick Deckard a blade runner whose job was to dispose such androids. Thus was the moral dillema: he was a murderer of innocent lives. And he had to live with the fact.The whole somber atmosphere of the movie was briliant. The production of future Los Angeles seems to me to be better than most modern CGI animated sequences and doesn't have that exageratedness than CGI could produce (like in the new Star Wars movie). The 'simplicity' of depicting a future haunting Los Angeles was the best I've seen in any sf flics. The only other atmosphere that had produced such effect of estrangement I think would be in 'eXistenz'.The most poignant scene that I would rate in my movie history was when the leader of the Android (played by Rutger Hauer) had saved the live of Deckard and said: 'I've seen the way the sun shines on the gates of Tannenbaum' or something of that order. It was such a deep scene that conveyed to my mind the existence of humanity and a whole human life in his short existence. It was like reading a novel, that scene conjure such a spectable of imagery of another existence. He was telling Deckard how human he was and how he loved life. More than human, more than morose Deckard.It is a spectacular glympse to another world more so than the epics (like Star Wars) because it only glympse it. Because it allows with in its enigmatic way the possibility of a grand world beyond anyone's dream.

Not meant to be so scathing of today's films, but when I first saw Blade Runner I was awed. It was so stylish, so smooth, so elegant. Maybe I'm looking at it from an odd perspective, but I found the entire movie, Ridley Scott's amazing use of light (or should I say usually lack of), and all the carefully placed metaphors to just be incredible.

This scene could be interpreted as important to understanding stuff in the movie, but I'm gonna make you watch it to figure out why!Maybe the greatest thing about Blade Runner is the philosophy aspect of it. Without giving away crucial parts of the film, the best scenes were the ones involving the \"Replicants\" (androids) where one's mirroring emotions of sympathy and anger push back and forth at seeing these killing machines defend their humanity and right to live before their human counterparts. I also found the humans' seemingly lack of understanding of the very things they created intriguing as well. All these things the movie dealt with; but to understand better you must watch the movie.Blade Runner is an amazing movie, and I would say Harrison Ford's best science fiction movie ; ).

With the Director's Cut, you get more involved with the film than in the original when Decard's voice-over did the thinking for you.

The greatest thing that this story does is make you understand the replicants more than just focus on Harrison. The only down side to this film was the over-acting and cheasyness in the scene where Decard trys to stop Rachael from leaving (the whole \"say 'kiss me'\" bit).

Having watched Blade Runner since I was young, the lines delivered by Rutger Hauer through the chase and on the roof in the penultimate scene have haunted me my whole life. Watching it again yesterday for the xth time, it was amazing how much detail and points of reference I can see that I never saw before; for me, the hallmark of a masterpiece. The echoes of a 40s film noir detective thriller are self-evident; the hair, the clothes, the constant darkness and rain, and also the fact that everyone smokes, and when they do they create vast plumes of smoke. Whether this is intentional I do not know, but is eerily effective. The film is incredibly well balanced (never seems like 1hour 50mins, does it?), the lighting is superb, the shadows and the strange focusing on the characters all very powerful. I have always been fascinated with the close-ups on the eyes, even the animals in the film. The flashes of red burning in the darkness. But again, this just echoes that which has already been said a thousand times by other critics. My personal views are that which I would really like to express. In comparison to other great works, such as the Godfather, which shines due to its excellent depiction by the actors concerned, I feel Blade Runner is powerful for the very opposite. The characters to me are not incredibly strong, indeed Harrison Ford plays down his role throughout, I think. What is more evocative is the sets, the lighting, the attention to every detail, the bewildering oriental influences, and of course, the mesmorising score by Vangelis. The plot is essentially very simple, and is never difficult to follow. In this way, the vast other questions raised by Blade Runner are given a chance to appear. Humanity, self-preservation, love, desire for life, playing God. The very questions we ponder now on Cloning and genectics are faced in this film nearly 20 years ago. The eternal search for the question Why is what I feel most comes from this film. The death of the Android at the end and his speech to Deckard say to me that that which we strive our whole lives to understand is suddenly clear to this machine at his very moment of death. His whole purpose for being, although predestined, was actually his, by breaking away and striving for questions he has in fact found all his answers.

This argument has a fundamental problem. It presumes that whatever noir is, it results when a certain number of elements are present, when a critical mass is reached. Because Blade Runner lacks `existential angst' (if, indeed, it does), it is incomplete. If we play this argument out, however, we can charge that Mildred Pierce is not film noir because it generally lacks dark interiors, rainy streets, high-contrast lighting, and other traditional noir traits. Mildred Pierce, though, is noir. Why? Because it suggests despair, shows the influence of psychoanalysis, and draws its momentum from tragic irony. Moreover, Mildred Pierce is noir because it was shot at the end of the Second War, by a European expatriate, when existentialism (of the Sartre variety) enjoyed a vogue. It reflects the historical and ideological temperament of the time when it was made. Blade Runner, on the other hand, appeared toward the end of the Cold War -- in a world tremendously different from 1945: a time when questions about living prosperously seemed more important that questions about life's meaning and absurdity. The crisis facing mankind, directors, and movie audiences 35 years after Hiroshima just wasn't the same -- we were not gripped in horrendous doubt and fear. If anything, we were gripped by technology; and if a popular negative philosophy existed, it was oriented around things like computers and artificial hearts, and how their inclusion in our world could eventually undermine our importance as going concerns. This philosophy certainly preoccupies Blade Runner, with its Lang-ian paranoia about machine intruders. So: the film is not existential for the same reason that Mildred Pierce is not tech. Both films reflect the fears and troubles afflicting the times in which they were made. I do not argue, however, that Scott's film is noir. Rather, I attack the claim that because it is not as noir as other films it is trash. It is of its time. Real Noir is of its time. Thus Blade Runner is an adventure movie with noir traits.It also has science fiction traits, as it creates a world that might be ours in the future. Its credulity -- like Things to Come, The Blob, and Invasion of the Body Snatchers -- forces us to look at ourselves. Strong sci-fi, after all, depicts an imagined future that is usually a projection, a magnification, of what we already know. This vision of the future is anything but optimistic, and because of this, it possesses a quasi-moralistic tone, a warning. In the future, the movie suggests, mankind will have destroyed its environment. Have the seeds of this destruction been planted? Yes. (No Nukes, Three Mile Island, Save The Whales....Environmental activism thrived during the late 70s/early 80s because fears of environmental degradation thrived.) By extension, all the other worst case scenarios shown in the film -- homelessness, corporate might, xenophobia, racism, misogyny -- are condemnations of contemporaneous social problems And this reasoning gets me thinking. In a world as fouled as the one depicted in the movie, lousy treatment of women seems like a behavior which would be normal. I'm not convinced, as some critics are, that the depiction of misogyny is a celebration of it. After all, aren't there numerous instances in Scott's films (Thelma And Louis, Alien, and GI Jane), when women are depicted as heroes and saviors? Finally, I have the feeling that Blade Runner is an important movie in the history of cinema. It is a Hollywood blockbuster -- an over-the-top extravaganza -- of the sort Star Wars and Jaws precipitated. Those films, however, were genre films on steroids (like Scott's Gladiator, in fact). Blade Runner isn't a genre film, however. It is hydra-headed: film noir, samurai, science fiction, dystopia, comic book, and horror. Because of this -- this attempt to be everything past in the brand new Hollywood of 1982 -- it may be categorized as homage, a farewell to Flash Gordon, Sam Spade, Soylent Green, and Frankenstein - to mass produced genre films. And because of this, it is a film about film -- about the separation of the new Hollywood from the old one, a hash of dead dreams and copies.\n.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Turning Point", "date": "2001-10-30T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0191498"}, {"content": "Ridley Scott's horrific future-vision of Alien was a landmark in cinema.

Very good plot and visual effects that should have wiped out E.T. in the oscars but before 1991 Blade Runner was stuck with a voice over narration by Harrison Ford which removed its dark noir inquiry.When you watch the movie you can tell how even the replicants can have biological \"FAKE\" emotions.But the question you must ask yourself is, is it moral to the humain protocal.

Their struggle till their last drop of sweat is out of their blood and they mearily colapse to the powerful impact of a 38. magnum.

Bladerunner is THE main one. I first saw the film in 1984, (ironic ?), and was literally blown away. As a film it operates in it's own believeable environment. Deckard, Rachel, Rory, Tyrell, Sebastian, all form empathic, believeable characters, all of them have they own rational desires & genuine motivations. Rory wants life, but in the end understands that it is such a precious commodity that even in his quest he cannot deny it of others. The themes of the film are worthy of Chaucer, or Shakespeare, and it's to Scotts' credit that he explores these in the film in the same way that Chaucer or Shakespeare would have done. In cinematic terms NO film since has managed to impart the same pathos, though a viewing of 'Hannibal' will show that Ridley has lost none of his art.

It seems to so contrast with his character. In an early scene he voices (albiet in the over dubbed version) criticism of a police man being racist (the 'skin jobs' comment).

It is the future and world is in ruins. Not by war, but by the extreme separation of classes and exploration of \"outer colonies\". This film version is based on the Philip K. Dick novel \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\". I think this one of the very few instances, that the movie has outdone the book. Los Angeles in 2019 is a dreary, rain-riddled ghetto where the poor workers live and breath the oppression of the police and big corporations. This fact is deeply emphasized in the novel, but the screen version clearly paints a disturbing picture of hopelesness, fear and low-class slavery to those too weak to fend for themselves. This is a society that immorally creates androids to explore dangerous colonies, and worse - implants emotions and memories into their synthetic minds. Harrison Ford gives a great performance as Deckard, a man reluctantly drawn back into action as a Blade Runner: a special police unit designated to terminate or \"retire\" stray humanoid robots called \"replicants\". When an angry band of replicants seek revenge on their greedy creators, its Deckard who must seek and destroy. The film touches on though-provoking aspects of human morality, and poses the question: Should man be allowed to create robots with real emotions. The consequences of playing god turn out to be desasterous when Deckard realizes the murderous nature of his profession. This is a complicated film that has a twisted emotional climax when Deckard comes face to face with the most lethal of his robotic targets. One of the best science fiction films of all time.

However, what was brilliant to me was visual. What wasn't was the story behind it.Harrison Ford, Sean Young, and M. Emmet Walsh had good acting performances; otherwise, the acting was not too special to me. If you want good acting in a similar film to this...watch Haley Joel Osment in AI (I use similar loosely.). Overall, acting was good, though. Cinematography, special effects, and music were dark, mysterious, and very appropriate. However, the plot was muddled.Perhaps this blurry storyline was what was intended. But, while watching the film, I became rather nonchalant to the characters. I didn't take sides in the film, and close to end, I simply didn't care (with the exception of the one brilliant scene with Sean Young, who suddenly became very philosophical). Overall, I found the movie too mysterious. If it was trying to say something, I to this day have no idea what the intent was. The ending (Director's Cut version) was weak to me. Honestly, it didn't do anything for me.Special effects are a tool to be used appropriately in movies; however, I think in this film, they became the overpowering appeal. The human/Replicant storyline didn't fulfill its role. This is unfortunate because I think this film has the potential to be a masterpiece.

Very good plot and visual effects that should have wiped out E.T. in the oscars but before 1991 Blade Runner was stuck with a voice over narration by Harrison Ford which removed its dark noir inquiry.When you watch the movie you can tell how even the replicants can have biological \"FAKE\" emotions.But the question you must ask yourself is, is it moral to the humain protocal. When they are being retired they hang on to their life as much as we do. Their struggle till their last drop of sweat is out of their blood and they mearily colapse to the powerful impact of a 38. magnum. Should creations we make ourself that initiate to environment we collapse to their knee's and receive enforcement. The movie is the best portrayer of that senario only in a dark un-narrated fashion.

Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electronic Sheep (a second edition of the book came out with the movie called Blade Runner: Do Androids Dream of Electronic Sheep, it's the same book).Set in the near future of Los Angeles, the world is dark, amorality is rampant, and humanity is a foreign concept. The Tyrell Corp. manufactures replicants, artificial humans that are stronger, faster, smarter, and only live four years before their entire genetic code craps out on them.Due to a violent replicant rebellion on one of the Off-World colonies, the replicants have been forbidden to ever come to earth under penalty of death or \"retirement\" as the act of killing a renegade replicant is called. The police department has its own unit that is assigned to the act of retiring these replicants. They are called Blade Runners. However, you, the viewer, never get to see Off-World. It really isn't so much an important location as it is a concept. It is a paradise. If you are physically fit and smart you can go. You don't have to work, you have replicant slaves to do it for you. It represents the elusive garden of Eden, however if you want to get in, you need to pass the standards.The movie is about Deckard Cain (Harrison Ford) as he is charged with the job of hunting down five replicants. Batty \"Roy\" (Rutger Hauer) is the leader of this group and is enigmatic as he is violent. Is he really to blame for his struggle for the survival of his family? Is he really to blame for his violent actions? After all, he only has four years of experience for in which to mentally develop. A four year old with a body superior to most all humans. A body with the capability to easily crush bone. Is he in his own way, more human than the apathetic creatures walking down the L.A. sidewalks? Not even turning their heads when someone knocks them to the side while running after a fleeing women with a gun in their hands? Others in the group include Pris\" the acrobat, \"Zhora\" the snake dancer, and \"Leon\" the simple one. The fifth replicant is only mentioned in the scene where Deckard is briefed on the aforementioned group. Even then, it is not said who it is. That is for the viewer to decide.Sean Young plays Rachael. Rachael is a replicant. A prototype. A new idea in the testing phase. The concept? A problem needs fixing: the replicants have not got enough time to build up the necessary experiences to develop emotionally. This results in child-like behavior. The solution? Memory implants. But much like Roy, she is an passionate individual, she loves, longs to be loved, loves life, and works for Tyrell. Oh ya, and she doesn't know she is a replicant.Then there is the tragic figure of J.F. Sebastion. Sebastion does genetic work for the Tyrell corporation. He is a lonely individual who lives in a very large building that would have been condemned by today's standards. His only friends are a few little robot things that bumble around his place. He is so desperate for a friend, he takes in a homeless girl from off the street to crash for a few days. He asks her what her name is.

The author has explored the prospects of artificial humans to the depth that Isaac Azimov has explored the world of robots. There is a philosophical overtone about the transitory nature of life that never becomes maudlin and is essential to the theme and the climax of the story. \nThe use of the Bradbury Building, an existing famous building in Los Angeles, with the forbidding edifice of the Tyrell Corporation creates a feeling of the timelessness of a city. There is enough atmosphere for three films and it permeates the action with purpose. Is this a warning about the future absorbing of our souls into technology to the point of even making life seem arbitrary?

Having read a book on the making of blade runner, I found out how hard it was to actually get this film made. Like other Philip Dick adaptions, this movie preserves his interesting premises on artificial intelligence (although it completely reverses them, Dick is not a dogmatic or ideological sci-fi writer like Stanislaw Lem or Arthur Clarke, both esteemed but inferior writers next to Dick) while pasting them on a superficial action story. Where Blade Runner becomes a great film is in the many layers of meaning contained in the film, some of which are surely unintentional to writers, director and definately actors. This film has an A-list of fabulous character actors, many of whom are still with us: Joanna Cassidy, Joe Turkel, J. Emmett Walsh, Edward James Olmos, and William Sanderson among others. Daryl Hannah is only competent but the real reason Harrison Ford hates this movie (publicly) is because Rutger Hauer completely stole it from him. Hauer's performance turns villainy inside-out, and I only wish they had given some kind of reason for his more sadistic moments -- i guess we're supposed to accept his childlike attitude about life extends to violence as well. I think there are many facets of the relationships between the characters (particularly Ford's and Young's) that are not spelled out, so many viewers may think that the superficial action yarn is all that's going on (I remember the first time I saw it thinking it was absolutely awful). The movie's plot is pretty disjointed, but I think in this way it mirrors other successful noirs like \"The Big Sleep.\" The music is excellent, Vangelis' best work, and I can hear its influence in much of the electronic music of the 90s.

It seems that there are cyborgs (called `replicants') mixed in with society that resemble humans in every way (they are, in fact, `more human than human,' a statement that all White Zombie fans are sure to notice), and, because they have turned against their makers, they need to be exterminated \u0096 or `retired,' as it is eloquently called. Clearly, the influence on the Terminator films is unmistakable. Blade Runner was made in 1982, back when Harrison Ford was working more in sci-fi than anything else, and even though the technology in the film is badly dated, the effect is still impressive. While it's setting is no longer in the distant future (2019), the film is still effective, despite the fact that with each passing year, it becomes less and less likely that the year 2019 will look like that. Besides its obvious influence on the Terminator, Blade Runner also pays subtle homage to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, in a scene where a video phone call charge is $1.25, the exact same charge as a video phone call in 2001 from the space station back to earth.\n(spoilers) One of the best features of this film, besides Ford's always-excellent performance, is the skilled direction of Ridley Scott. Also, the special effects were also very impressive, both in creating the futuristic atmosphere and in other areas, such as some very impressive and amazingly violent replicant deaths. Pris' death, in particular, was incredibly convincing. The conflict in this film stems form the fact that Ford's character develops emotional feelings for one of the replicants, and he has to face the reality that she must be destroyed. Clearly, there are numerous scenes in this film that verify the fact that the replicants do, in fact, experience emotion, and this is not shown only by the replicant that Harrison falls for. The nazi looking replicant pushes Pris' tongue back into her mouth with his own tongue after her violent death, which left her tongue protruding slightly. Sure, that's not a real appealing sight, but it makes a pretty strong point.Blade Runner very much deserves the classic status that it has achieved. It is a very well thought out and very involved science fiction story, and it reflects influences from earlier classic science fiction films like 2001 and even, from the distant past, Metropolis.

And how can he reconcile that morally, since these constructs may, for better or worse, have developed some form of free thought, a soul if you will?

Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, is a Sci-fi slash Noir film about a cop named Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) in a decrepit 2019 Los Angeles whose job it is to \"retire\" four genetically engineered syborgues, known as \"Replicants\". The four fugitives, Pris (Daryl Hannah), Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), Leon (Brion James), and their leader, Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), have escaped from an off-world colony in order to find their creator and bully him into expanding their pre-determined four year life span. This film originally flopped when it came out in 1982, but since has become a widely acclaimed cult classic with a director's cut to boot. A large part of the success that this movie has received can be attributed to its ability to operate on many different levels.Ridley Scott's hauntingly possible depiction of what might become of Los Angeles down the line is absolutely brilliant. It captures elements of Noir with its urban atmosphere of decadence, lighting, and characters neither clearly defined as good nor evil. Corruption is everywhere. The garbage-littered streets and permanence of dark and rain give us the sense that we've seriously screwed up the atmosphere, and the impression that all respectable human beings have fled to the off-world colonies, leaving only the scum of the earth behind.There is a hint of style from the 40's, especially with respect to cars, costumes, and music. Rachael's entire outfit, including her hair, screams the 40's.The soundtrack, arranged by Vangelis (who won an Oscar for his Chariots of Fire score), consisted mainly of Jazz and Blues. This functioned to represent a dark, moody world of uncertainty and pessimism.The special effects were exceptional. Much of the set was pulled off using models. In my opinion, sets made by hand require leagues more of skill and are much more impressive and realistic than those computer generated. These guys really knew what they were doing. I was especially fond of the pyramidesque Tyrell Corporation building, which hinted at the god-like presence of Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkell), the creator.The script (Hampton Fancher, David Peoples, and of course Phil Dick) worked for me, as well as the actors who gave voice to it. Harrison Ford was well...Harrison Ford. I thought he did a tremendous job down-playing the role. His voice-over narration helped you along, and was yet another feature conducive to Film Noir (apparently this was taken out of the Director's Cut). Rutger Hauer's performance was intense. His lines at the end were intriguingly philosophical. Daryl Hannah's chilling robotic expressions were quite impressive. Joanna Cassidy was just plain hot.There is more to this film than just pulp. It works on so many remarkable levels. The movie itself is a detective noir quest for the meaning of life in a science fiction environment, but the story is a commentary on what it means to be human and the questions each one of us have about life, like: How long have I to live? Why do I have to die? What happens when I die? Doesn't my maker care? Is this all merely an illusion? At the end of the film we are left to wonder if these Replicants are human, and if Deckard himself is in fact a Replicant. Scott raises more questions here than he answers, and as a result, critics are still debating the mysteries of this film today.

Was it directed poorly? I don't think so. The movie just takes a bit of 'paying attention' to it. Like many other people, I just didn't like at first because it didn't fullfill my expectations that it would be an action-packed science fiction adventure with another Han Solo-esque hero. This movie was different. Han Solo wasn't Han Solo at all. Harrison Ford, is a Blade Runner; he's this depressed alcholic kind-of-guy and he's not even a hero really: he's kind of a creep. He's a bounty hunter who ruthlessly hunts down these poor replicants (who were enslaved by humans to work in horrible conditions on outer planet colonys) who wanted freedom. But since Replicants are not human, they are fair game to kill. Or are they human?I think the movie was released at a bad time, with a bad ending. The director's cut helped that little glitch. The scenery is beyond amazing, and the realism of a futuristic city here is probably the most convincing I have seen. But just to warn you if you havn't seen this movie: you will either like this film or hate it. I've seen people walk out on this movie, yet I've also seen people really enjoy it.

We are the highest in the food chain, highest in intellect, and highest in our own selfishness. Yes, we humans are all a bunch of arrogant viruses, endlessly striving to satisfy our ever growing needs and a better quality of life, by consuming the available resources around us in vast amounts.Greenpeace, animal rights, zoos - they might provide short term solutions to allow nature in general, and other species of animal a place on this earth - but it isn't going to last. The human population will continue to grow - as long as there are very few predators to hunt us, and ever advancing medical science keeps us living for longer. Eventually there will be so many people on this planet that there will not be enough space for any other species.At present - even though it may seem that humans make a up an unhealthy large number for one kind of species - insects are still the most numerous species on this planet. But in the world of Blade Runner (a pseudo, media inspired, prophecy of the future) it seems that humans have once and for all surpassed even insects in their numbers. According to the movie, it appears that not a square inch of the planet has been left untouched by the human tendency to use up all of its available resources, and occupy it with fume belching industry; or erect very large, menacing buildings, intrusive transport infrastructure, and seedy night spots, in the place of virgin forest and vast plain.But its not all doom and gloom. We are intelligent, if very selfish, creatures - and we do possess certain problem solving skills. We humans - being the bright chaps we are (and at the same time ONLY thinking about ourselves) - have recognised that we are rapidly running out of space on our planet, and so have logically found a solution to this growing problem. The solution is to look forward from the confines of the Earth, and out into space and the prospect of colonising other planets.This is the world of Blade Runner - a world that reminds us so much of our own world, and where its heading, that it's frightening, disturbing, and absolutely awe inspiring at the same time. The film takes this scenario, locates the action in a sprawling North American Metropolis (that oozes menace, darkness, decay, and a strange organic beauty); throws in a plot about some off-world genetic clones rebelling and returning to Earth; incorporates a tension ridden, exciting and unsettling script (and some rather talented players, come to think of it); and mixes it around with a subtle but emotive musical score, and some striking imagery; in a shiny, and slightly rusty, pudding bowl.It's disturbing, thought-provoking, awe-inspiring, futuristic nonsense at its best.

After 19 years of public life 'Blade Runner' is considered a 'cult movie' transcending the genre becoming a classic. The plot may seem a little bit simple at first sight however 'Blade Runner' raises some of the most fundamental questions flirting with existentialism as well as humanism. If the movie was inspire by Philip K. Dick's novel: 'Do Androids dream of Electric Sheep', the realization of the scenario differed completely. The story takes place in a dark and urban near future where Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford best role) is a blade runner, a cop and has been asked to retire/kill 4 replicants who escaped from an obscure space colony, have hijacked a space ship to return home back on earth (where they have been declared illegal) seeking for their 'maker'(the charismatic Joe Turkel). The mission turns out much more difficult than expected. The 4, soon 5 replicants are not 'computers' they are 'physical' (Human made by Human through genetic manipulation I assume). They have great intelligence and superior physical abilities and resistance. They are looking for answers and are determine to get them what ever it takes. Their questioning will become ours: What makes us human? Are we human from birth in other words by essence? Or do we become human with what we do, through what we achieve? Who is a human being? Rick Deckard who tracks down Zhora (the beautiful Joanna Cassidy) or the tragic Zhora who after a stressful hunt seems suddenly so close to us when being shot down, frozen in an everlasting slow motion made of shattering glasses. Roy Batty who discovers his own humanity when facing his last trial, the only trial he will never win: death ; or Eldon Tyrel who plays God but has forgotten to play Human? Maybe 'memories' is the clue we are looking for? But what kind of memory and whose memory? Sure my memory (personal or common) is part of what makes me act as a human being but doesn't it alienates me like a trauma alienates a patient? So love has to be the ultimate clue. But in that case what kind of love? The love that shows Deckard to Rachael (the enigmatic Sean Young) made of sarcasm and bitterness or the love shared by the powerful Roy Batty (the awesome Rutger Hauer) and the wild Pris (best role ever for Daryl Hannah)? What feeling shows more humanity? The kiss made of tears that Roy lives on Pris's cold lips. Or the one that Deckard stills from Rachael after making her uncomfortable? Ridley Scott lives the answers to each and every one of us. Once again (Alien 1979) he has created a fantastic atmosphere made of dark streets, flying cars, post modern buildings, flame burst in a black sky, everything blend in a powerful and spiritual music written by the talented Vangelis. Once again he had the right actors: Edward James Olmos as the ambiguous Gaff, William Sanderson playing the pathetic and naive J. F. Sebastian or Bryan James as the powerful and hopeless Leon. In this environment the so call humans behave like 'soulless machines' and the so call machines are searching for their soul discovering their humanity.

However, most movies I tend go after are usually the relatively unknowns (such as \"Hangmen Also Die!\", \"Dark City\", and \"The Professionals\"). In doing so, I usually pass the ones everyone else has seen a hundred times already. Up until two days ago, \"Blade Runner\" was part of that group. I'd seen a little bit of it back when I was a kid, chopped up on TV by some stupid telethon, but this is the first time that I've seen it all the way through (with the letterboxed director's cut, thankfully; never trust a studio to edit a film right).Once I got over my annoyance at no onscreen credit for the writers (at least for the opening credits and the tape case; like most people, I don't stick around for the end credits), I realized how much I actually enjoyed this movie. I look at this L. A. in a 2019 that I hope never comes and I see a world that is the logical updating of Fritz Lang's \"Metropolis\": dehumanized, dreary, and rotting from the inside. There can be no better representation of this world than the replicants, synthetic human beings who surpass the average human in intelligience, speed, and agility, but who only have four years to enjoy them however they can. Is it truly any wonder, therefore, that the Nexus 6 models rebelled the way they did? Four years isn't very long, so what's the point of toiling under masters you can live without? No wonder the corporations want them dead.Deckard (as played by Harrison Ford) has been called many things: a 21st century Sam Spade, an anti-Han Solo, and even a replicant himself. To me, the true answer is none of the above. Deckard is Deckard, that is all. Unlike Sam Spade, he doesn't enjoy the job he has to do or really even tolerates it. It's obvious that it makes him sick to have to gun down people whose only crime is wanting to choose their own destiny. Deckard doesn't have that luxury and every downed replicant seems to kill another piece of his soul.From this, it's been suggested that Deckard is a replicant himself. Again, I don't think so. Such an assertion is too easy an answer for Deckard's revulsion for the profession he quit once already. Besides, infiltration is something that his employers have undoubtably considered and so probably make a point of screening potential candidates. Add all this to the fact that Deckard can't roll with the replicant's superpowered punchs any better than the rest of the general population and all you have left is a man who is deeply troubled by the trap his life has become.Rutger Haeur's Roy is no less complicated himself. Granted, thanks to the lack of emotional maturity that he was engineered with, he has no qualms about such things as wantonly taking life and serious injury. Yet, for all that, all he truly wants is to live a little longer than what's already been built into him. The whole point of the final cat-and-mouse chase through the Bradbury (also used for \"The Outer Limits\" episode, \"Demon With A Glass Hand\", and the TV movie, \"The Night Strangler\") was not so much kill or be killed as it was to make Deckard understand what it feels like to be a replicant.While there is no denying Scott's impeccable style on display here (any lover of German Expressionism or film noir would appreciate it), the story development involved is not given nearly enough credit. It's almost as if the public wants to forget that someone (in this case, the legendary Phillip K. Dick, who wrote the film's basis, \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" and Hampton Fancher, who adapted it to screen) had to actually sit down, plot things out, and bang the story into shape. But without the efforts of Messers. Dick and Fancher, there would be no \"Blade Runner\" or if there were, it would not be nearly as good. Not even a director of Scott's obvious ability can make up for such a fundamental component (don't believe me? Try watching \"1492\" without falling asleep or throwing up). So, in spite of the efforts of whoever decided to omit the writing credits, kindly remember the aforementioned gentlemen who did the job.

It is understandable why. The film has a disjointed, postmodern narrative surrounded by superb photography and set design. The hero is not even a hero and the conclusion of the film, at least the director's cut, isn't all that happy. Most of all, Blade Runner eerily shadows the near future for our own world, the future of cloning and unnaturally created humans. Science fiction has always been able to show us images of ourselves or our world in a future or alien world, things we would prefer not to see.Blade Runner's premise is simple. Deckard (Harrison Ford) has to hunt down four \u0091Replicants': artificial humans who have great intelligence but superior physical attributes. These replicants have run amock in space colonies and now human authorities on Earth are worried that the replicants will do the same here.All of this is really nothing more than a faint attempt at a story. Blade Runner's success lies not with its story element, but with the amazing vision of fantasy and fear of its director, Ridley Scott. Scott had previously made \"Alien\", another postmodern vision of man's possible future. In that film he questioned colonisation, globalization (but on a intergalactic scale), our fascination with destriction and the corruption of modern business. In \"Blade Runner\", Scott explores corruption, man's destructive nature, but he also delves into emotion and the possibility of someone ELSE creating those emotions for us, as is the case for the replicants.The plot plays second fiddle to the set design and costumes. The choice of Los Angeles being the setting for the film is brilliant: at present L.A. is a city blanketed in sunshine, with an image of blonde babes and surfers all too obvious. In \"Blade Runner\" the city is nothing like it is today. It has become a blend of Tokyo, New York and some Eastern European wasteland of pollution.The vehicle, weapons and costumes all have a distinctive 1980's - apocalyptic - retro feel to them, the flying cars are almost too cheesy to be taken seriously, but combined with Vangelis' synthesizer score and the noir-ish feel of the narrative they fit just perfectly.\n\"Blade Runner\"'s narrative is just that: film noir. Deckard is akin to Sam Spade, he's seen it all, been there and back, and is a tortured soul. It's got the femme fatale, the more evil than evil villan and the corporation that is somehow responsible for all this mess. At the same time the film is a thriller, a western and a science fiction yarn.Harrison Ford is suited as Deckard. He is the anti-Han Solo or Indiana Jones. Rutger Hauer is superbly evil too, it is a shame he hasn't been able to follow this up with anything as good.Many films since this have tried to show a world void of any semblances of what we take for granted today, but none have compared to \"Blade Runner\". The film that came closest to it would be the Japanese animation \"Akira\" which also deals with similar themes.Science fiction always succeeds when the viewer is planted in the story one step beyond what might have actually happened. See Planet of the Apes, Alien, Star Wars, et al. In \"Blade Runner\" we get a vision of the world as it may actually be one day. Maybe not 2019, but somewhere down the track the science fiction of films such as these may become science fact.\"Blade Runner\" is one of THE definitive sci-fi movies ever made.", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 97, "votes": 186}, "heading": "Style over substance, yet still impressive", "date": "2001-01-24T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0191401"}, {"content": "A leap of fantasy into the future: a lone voyager observes astonished the dark rainy skies of a futuristic LA brilliantly represented as China Town in NY.

And the lovely replicants, sensible souls captured in synthetic yet perfect and beautiful bodies. If you grew up in the eighties, you will recognize Siouxie in one of them. The movie is a prism, and the story is enrapturing. It takes concentration, and a mature, sober mind. I personally watched it the first time while I was a stoned 14 years old, and couldn't understand anything about it. I had to watch it again and again before slapping my forehead for not having understood before what a masterpiece it is. Harrison Ford is the reluctant agent chosen to capture 5 replicants escaped from a far away colony, where they were sent to conquer land for the swarming terrestrials. The replicants are perfect imitation of humans, and are programmed to last only a number of years. But these have decided to rebel to their programmed destiny. As Harrison Ford begins to inquire further and deeper, he understands that the fear of these replicants is in fact human. Living in fear. What an atrocious destiny that of the replicants. The dramatic final is perfectly cathartic in that salvation and optimism lies in one established uncontroversial truth: technology.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Beautiful like the Systin Chapel", "date": "2001-01-17T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0191399"}, {"content": "This film is a veritable masterpiece.A flop when it was first released it has surely stood the test of time as the years have rolled onward.

A replicant is a robot which so closely approximates humanity that it is almost impossible to distinguish it from the real thing. Even the replicant itself may fail to realise that it is merely a machine. The robots are programmed with a maximum lifespan of four years, a safety device intended to prevent them becoming too knowledgeable, and therefore a threat to human beings. Furthermore, each replicant is provided with software which contains a fictitious but credible personal history, so it 'remembers' its own childhood. The breakaway band of replicants poses a threat to Los Angeles. Usually, combat androids such as these spend their working lives in space, stuck on labour colonies orbiting the earth. Mutinies are usually contained locally but this gang has made its way back to earth because its leader, Roy Batty, wants to force the humans to extend his lifespan. Blade runners are essentially police officers who specialise in 'retiring' (that is, destroying) apostate robots. Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a blade runner and he is given the task of hunting down the four surviving members of the replicant band. What follows is a rather mundane cops-and-bad-guys movie in a quirkily futuristic setting. And what of this future world? Cops patrol the city in black-and-white squad cars, just like in 1982, but now the cars can hover in the air. The depiction of downtown architecture is visually impressive, but unfortunately it is patent nonsense. Urban traffic and the science of robotics will not be like this in 2019. This science fiction is so much science baloney. \"Watch out for water,\" says J.F. Sebastian as he shows Priss to his apartment, and it is a warning that should be standard in every Ridley Scott film. Why does Ridley always conceive of the future in terms of steam gouts, dripping ceilings and restless searchlights? And why, for that matter, must a man in a fez always be devious and cowardly? Rutger Hauer makes a terrific villain, mixing suavete with chilling ruthlessness. Daryl Hannah and Brion James are interesting casting choices as the replicants Priss and Leon, and Harrison Ford is Harrison Ford. The character of Rachel (played by Sean Young) adds intellectual depth to an otherwise pedestrian shoot-'em-up. Her moment of tragic self-comprehension is the best thing in the film. I for one fail to see why this film is slavered over and hailed a cult masterpiece. The storyline is dull and no character, with the possible exception of Rachel, has any internal life.

It doesn't always seem to try to be \"entertaining\" so much as \"enveloping\" or \"involving.\" Not much \"ride 'em cowboy\" stuff here save a few combative scenes.But I *was* completely enveloped, and I savored this film even the first time I saw it in the late 1980's (on HBO or something like that.) I've seen it several times since and I still love it (even with its occasional editing flaws.) I'll never forget Rutger Hauer's performance, which I think was one of his better ones (or, at least he seemed perfectly suited as the \"Roy Batty\" character.)Besides the excellent atmosphere, the film handles its premises regarding aspects of being, consciousness, humanity and mortality quite well. It seeps into your pores as you become involved in the suffocating, oppressive and fascinating landscape. I think this is what film is for, as opposed to simply reading a book. It comes across non-verbally as well as verbally.I really got a lot out of the interactions between Deckard and Rachel. I also was convinced by Roy Batty's (Rutger Hauer) transformation and his place as the defining throughline of the movie. Although I don't see why the \"God of Biomechanics,\" Tyrell (Joe Turkel) would have such low security so as to be killed by one of what he must know are potentially dangerous creations of his, I was able to suspend disbelief and was very much affected by all of that and it still haunts me from time to time to this day. In a way, there is a side to many of us that might wish to ask the same questions of God (if you think he/she/it exists). \"What a thing it is to meet your maker,\" says Batty.Appropriately, the most defining scene for me was Batty's monologue near the end: \"..all these moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain.\" Hard to believe one could shed tears over science fiction, but I did. Then again, I'm prone to think about such things, but I'm sure this is what the movie was intended to do.So, this film carefully treads territory that few sci-fi films have or could. Almost all are either adventures or horror movies. This was a dramatic and introspective sci-fi film and although the premises have been dealt with before it handled them with great aplomb. Hey, I like a good adventure like the next person, and I'm a Star Wars fan, too. But you have to know when to shift gears and evaluate something on its own merits. Trying to shove this film into some pre-defined sci-fi box just isn't very fair or very insightful practice. It is a fairly unique effort, and needs to stand alone and apart.All in all, I thoroughly respect this multilayered, artful, thoughtful and interesting anti-utopian experience.By the way, the \"director's cut\" is clearly superior to the \"dumbed-down\" original version where the studio thought that everything ought to be \"explained\" to the audience, among other things (like the \"happy ending.\") They were probably worried that the average (ticket buying) sci-fi fan would need spoon-feeding for such a langorous and contemplative movie. Judging by some of the comments here, they might have been right.

This question is asked of every major character in the film - Deckard, Batty, and Rachel, and mirrored in many of the minor characters.

The dark, futuristic setting blends well with the detective/film noir tone of the film.And, while in 1982 the average person would not necessarily feel that the scenario presented could happen in his lifetime (at the time it was likely easier to believe that Atari would be taking out huge lighted add space on the sides of buildings), lately Blade Runner has gained a whole new poignancy.One more thing: Dark City could be considered this film's cousin.

With these two films I mentioned he directed the two most important science-fiction movies since 'Star Wars' and defined a style which became regular in films like 'Dark City', the other 'Alien'-films, 'Outland' or 'Terminator'. This dark, quiet tone with not too much action, not too much story but a lot of style and atmosphere. Today it seems impossible to make a film like 'Blade Runner'.Maybe one of the most important differences is the look of the special effects. I like big CG-effects which make you go 'Ah' and 'Oh', but the effects in sci-fi films of the 80's are different and somehow better than today. Most of them are models and matte paintings and this looks somehow more realistic. You see that the big complex the industrial named Tyrell lives in is real. It is standing there. This always amazed me.But 'Blade Runner' has more than special effects, although they were and are really impressing. I was pretty sure there was more and during watching the film the second time after several years (this time in the Director's Cut) I wondered what. I mean, the story isn't really so complicated and hard to understand. Cop has to find four replicants. Replicants don't want to die. I mean, that's it. The characters all seem to be unhappy and with a lot of secrets but that's nothing new. This hasn't changed pretty much. And you don't get to know so much more about them.I think the films lives nearly entirely out of his atmosphere. Everything looks so dark and so much full of atmosphere you nearly can feel it. It's always raining (and it does in most dark science-fiction-films, because there are less things that produce more atmosphere) and always dark (the same). The characters are looking more at each other than they talk. They look at each other and into mirrors and in to the dark sky. This is what makes them alive, since you don't know anything about them.Consider Harrison Ford's character. At the beginning he sits in a Chinese fast-food bar. He says he quit his job as a blade runner and he doesn't want to do it anymore. Why? Why can his former chief (M. Emmet Walsh) so simply put him back into his old job? You see some photos in Ford's apartment but never get to know who the people on it are. But still I think it's his best role ever. It's his only role where he plays a character who isn't simply good. He does a bad job and he knows it.Still, this a really fascinating movie with lots of neat details like the big elevator at Tyrell's or the puppets at Sebastian's who always run into the same door. And the showdown between Ford and Hauer (who had definitely his best role here) is just fantastic. But does anything of this make real sense? I'm not quite sure. And I'm less sure if I think about the work of the author Philip K. Dick on whose novel the film is based. Dick is a fantastic sci-fi writer and he has always a lot to say. He makes us think. 'Blade Runner' made me think too. But I just didn't get anywhere.

Olmos was in the apartment. It shows HE KNEW Deckard is a replicant.Moreover, the director's cut don't have the final image in the highway (with Rachel in the car, the voice of Deckard in off and giving a happy end to the movie). The first time I saw the movie I liked it, maybe because it gave me five minutes of happiness.But now, I understand the movie doesn't need a happy stupid end to be a better movie. The end is happy anyway, because you have hope. Rachel will died very soon (and maybe Deckard too), but every body will die.

I also contend that The Matrix never would have been made if it weren't for the vision provided by Ridley Scott in BR.The ability to marry set design with story line has NEVER been demonstrated better than in BR. The story is so well supported by the setting that it is developed without the need for action or dialog (although both are done superbly). The bleak emptiness of the human condition is magnificently reflected in the cloying closeness of urban decay contracted with the huge empty living spaces occupied by the Tyrell Corporation and the ruined apartment building of the penultimate scenes. That the only true longing for life and beauty is evidenced by androids gives the ultimate expression of the effete condition to which mankind has fallen.Hey folks, this is art. It ain't pretty, and it ain't what you're used to (or at least what we weren't used to back in '82). But it is a compelling statement which demands a response. Ignore it if you think you can, but I guarantee you it was not ignored by the generation of SF cinema storytellers who have followed.[Not to belabor the point: but has anyone noticed the eerily similar juxtaposition of movies between Kubrick and Scott that is evident. Kubrick did 2001, A Clockwork Orange, and Barry Lyndon in order, while Scott did The Duellists, Alien and Blade Runner. Coincidence? Probably.

I first saw this on video back in the early 80s when VHS movies still cost $100 a piece, and it has continued to be a favorite of mine despite my aging and changing tastes.I tend to be the exception and not the norm in that I much prefer the theatrical release to the director's cut. I have always viewed Blade Runner as a futuristic detective film with a sci-fi setting, and thus Deckard's voice-overs in the theatrical release are a key part of the film for me. the director's cut lacks these and to me has far less impact.I also disagree with the view that the director's cut takes. It strongly suggests that Deckard himself is a replicant that is simply fooled into killing his own kind. I feel that ruins the entire movie, as my interpretation of the film is that the replicants are the only beings in the bleak future who truly understand the importance of loving life. In the theatrical release, there is a certain amount of irony that the short lived replicants are teaching Deckard just how important life is. In the director's cut, we are lead to believe Deckard himself is a replicant and thus that irony is lost, as is the entire concept of loving whatever live we are given. In short, the director's cut transforms Deckard from the hurt and confused man (and human as he is in the Theatrical release) to simply a machine programmed to kill his own kind. Thus motives go from being emotions to programming, which kills any concept of feelings. I have viewed my old VHS tape time and time again and refuse to purchase the DVD until they come out with a version of the theatrical release. With the technology of DVDs, I do not see why they cannot have both versions on one disc- wasn't that a prime selling point of DVDs?- to have multiple versions of a film on the same disc? I have been flamed time and time again, but I think the director's cut is simply not very good in that it removes the most powerful element of the film- that being Deckard's voice overs which express his humanity and motives.

I don't usually like futuristic themes that are dark and violent, but in this case, the violence has something to say-- although curiously bloody (most of the deaths involve Replicants) it's not gratuitous, but part of an unfolding mystery that shocks you at the end (in the same way that the film \"Sixth Sense\" does). The acting is fantastic, with some great performances by the main characters, including tough Harrison Ford, beautiful Sean Young, and the charismatic Rutger Hauer (who delivers a \"hammy\" performance which is strangely, both entertaining and believable). The supporting actors are great too.Many film critics have already gone into depth about the meaning of the over-the-top symbolism. Much of that symbolism enters the right brain, not the left, and you just feel something without knowing why. I would call that manipulative, but interestingly, the lasting impressions aren't dependent on the imagery, as spectacular as the visuals are. Even with all the great camera angles and special effects, the experience is more emotional than visual.To me, the film is about consciousness, and what defines it. Is it our emotions, our mentality, or some undefined spiritual quality? And most important, does it have to be organically based? If consciousness is self-awareness, the ability to understand time, the ability to feel, to learn, the ability to love-- then what if an android, who is more machine than human, has all those qualities... what then? Is it still murder to kill one? Is it still okay to use them as slaves? And what about animals?\nThe first time I watched this film, at the end, I wanted Harrison Ford's character to go over the edge of the building. When I watched it a second time, I understood why he did not, and I was shocked. Believe or not, I did not get it-- the twist-- until the second viewing. That scene, with Rutger Hauer in the rain, is so profound and sad. Really listen to what his character says... because in the end, when we die, isn't it the sum total of our experiences-- our memories, our feelings-- that makes us who we are? Isn't it the uniqueness of those experiences that makes individual consciousness precious, that makes us define human life as something worth preserving in a moral sense? Another thought provoking question: is consciousness lost when we die-- for humans, non-humans, and animals? The film offers so many subtle clues, but you don't have to pick up on any of them to be moved.This film is incredibly thought provoking, a unique mix of haunting music (Vangelis), dark, smoky visuals, and intricate details.

I also had the soundtrack by Vangelis in my possession for quite some time. I was addicted to Blade Runner even though i never seen the film.Well tonight that changed. I saw it, i loved it. It lived up to all my expectations. I loved the storyline, and the atmosphere, the futuristic film noir presentation of the movie. I recognised a lot from the game, and almost the whole soundtrack comes back in the film. I was very happy that 'Memories Of Green' was in the movie, at a point where Deckard and Rachel are in Deckard's appartement. Memories of Green is my favorite song of the soundtrack. It has just the right feel, the sollitude that Deckard feels in this forsaken, lonely place called Earth.The only downpoint in the movie is that it only takes 112 minutes. The characters could have had so much more depth if only there was more time to explain. For example, in the game the main character starts to question his own identity. Am i a replicant, or a human. At one point in the movie i thought Deckard had the same feeling, but you never got to see a whole lot of who Deckard really was. So you could never really fully understand his feelings or motives. Which i feel is such a shame.I'm also a little proud seeing this movie. I'm dutch, and seeing Rutger Hauer (also dutch) perform in the way that he does makes me very proud to see that this little country can deliver such acting greatness. For me Roy Batty was his best part ever, the way he playes this angry replicant is so cool.Blade Runner isn't just a sience fiction movie.

Interesting or original. The movie I saw was none of these. Instead it was 1) unforgivabley slow-moving and 2) very dated.It started off with promise.

The Heart of the movie (message) wise should revolve around the problem that could comes from Genetic engineering (which WILL be possible in the future). The Genetic engineering which spawned replicants has been used to enhance the general population. The degrees of Genetic manipulation has created a Class system.

The Blade Runners of the highest elite class, had the job of hunting down the once rare now destined to be extinct 5th class normal humans. The elite class is vastly stronger, more agile and intelligent then the once normal humans. Only the elite class has the extra abilty none of the other 3 classes has, psycic ability.

And they were actually AT the Tyrell Corporation. Why did Deckard go to all that trouble of getting a blurred, half picture of Zhora off a photo when he could have shown a perfectly clear picture of her off the same data base? And why didn't he just arrest her instead of posing as an investigater from the committee of moral abuses? He knew who she was. How did Roy Batty know Deckards name? They'd never met and Leon was too far away in noisy traffic to hear Deckard talking to his chief after he shot Zhora. Why, if Replicants were illegal on earth by penalty of death was Rachel allowed to wander the streets? Why would Deckard go in alone against two superhuman androids? In real life they'd call a SWAT team, throw in gas cannisters and storm the place. Instead he goes in and gets his arse kicked. Why did Pris run the full length of a room, thus giving Deckard time to get hold of his gun and shoot her? Would America, which fought a bitter civil war over slavery and is so obsessed with personal freedom that it allows it's own citizens to blow each other away with assault rifles; allow a sudden return to slavery of intelligent, lifelike androids? It's all terribly silly.And this business of Deckard being a replicant. How does that enhance the story? Replicants are illegal on earth, so they're unlikely to let him wander about even BEFORE he quit. And aren't replicants superhuman? Wouldn't he have noticed that hot water doesn't scald him? Daft.But it all works because of brilliant performances, art design and Ridley Scott's direction. After this you'd think he'd become one of the great auters but instead he ended up making routine fare like 'White Squal' with it's embarrassing court scenes. It always puzzled me that straight after Blade Runner he took the least interesting bit with some dwarfs and made a film around them.Apparently Ford didn't like the film but I suspect this was because Hauer stole the film from under him with a rivetting performance. It is unusual that the cop was the unsympathetic assassin and it's also unusual for the lead to disappear for a large section of a movie. I think a remake would be pointless as it couldn't top old Rutger's speech on the roof. Scott is said to be a fan of Tarkovsky's Solaris and I see a certain influence. The slow direction with a lot of action happening in real time rather than dictated by rapid cutting and pounding music. This slow pace lulled you into the brutal final confrontation unawares. Also the relationship with Rachel and the meditations on memory were reminiscent of Tarkovsky's film.I remember when I first saw this at the flicks everyone was taken aback at the brutal head crushing scene and were immediately on edge at what was going to hit them for the rest of the film. We left wondering why it had arrived in the UK so unheralded.

The story is a good one, although the real reasons to watch this film is the mood. This is helped mostly by Vangelis' amazing score, which is probably the best music I have ever heard in a film. The opening theme is just incredible, and sets the scene perfectly. The rest of the music, especially the Love Theme, are all wonderful, dreamy and add so much to the scenes. The performances are all very good, none more so than Rutger Hauer's, who looks like he's having a lot of fun as the leader of the Replicants. Also, the director's cut is better than the original, as the ending felt like it was just added on to please audiences, whilst Harrison Ford's voice over blocked out some of the excellent music.

The eye, gazed upon the skyline of a futuristic L.A., views erupting fireballs from factories, a hazy, clouded horizon, and structures of cathedral-like architecture. To me, this summarizes the idea of the film: a future where technology has gotten the best of us and our future is muddled with uncertainty. Perhaps we are approaching such a time when images like this will be commonplace.I saw Blade Runner years ago on television, and I must have been nine or ten. It moved pretty slow, and I figured that because it had Harrison Ford in it, that I was in for a roller coaster ride. Not quite. I was asleep in minutes. However, in 1996 I read a captivating article about it in Entertainment Weekly, and I drove to the mall to get it. Since I love the widescreen format, I purchased that particular version. I pumped it in the VCR and was HYPNOTIZED. The very idea of technology going out of control, like creating artificial beings in our likeness to perform hazardous and undesirable tasks, and having it backfire in our faces was unique. A vision of American society, 37 years hence (from 1982, when the movie was created), with hovercars, architecture having evolved to unreasonable limits, androids working alongside humans, distant space colonies, videophones, with hairstyles, clothes, weapons, and television sets of the 20th century creates a strangely beautiful depiction of where we just might be headed. I apologize for the extremely long sentence! However, the sometimes dated special effects, corny looking cars, the stoic, robotic delivery of some dialogue (\"It's too bad she won't live... but then again, who does?\") notwithstanding, this all works in favor of the film. This is why Blade Runner is a noir-ish sci-fi film, like The Matrix and Demolition Man are, that not everyone will enjoy. Is it exciting to watch? Not neccesarily. Will you be glued to the chair, pulse pounding? Probably not. The underlying idea runs much deeper than the average future-based flick (like Freejack!) and correctly earns its cult status.The soundtrack and score is entrancing, particularly the opening \"eye\" scene and the credits music. You can order it from any music store. It is typical of most Ridley Scott movies to incorporate a memorable, ear pleasing score, like Alien or Legend.The stark, sad view of 2019, in all likelyhood, may not be what this century will digress into.

The Director's Cut transforms a good movie into a great one.\nWhat are the most popular Sci-fi movies these days, Blade or The Matrix? You notice the trench coats, the dark sets and the hunting for the bad guys plot lines? In many ways these movies are pale imitations of Blade Runner. Movie fans are all excited about virtual reality plots with super intelligent machines. It's all in Blade Runner but in a much more serious way.\nUnderneath a classic police manhunt/detective story lies visions of the future from author Phillip K. Dick. The super intelligent future machines will be our slaves not our masters. They will be genetically based, created and sold by huge powerful corporations. The wealthy will live in luxury while most people live in dirty, over populated cities in a polluted environment. These are the basic premises of Blade Runner and frankly I think most people have trouble dealing with it because it is likely to happen. Matrix fans talk about sinister forces being in control of the world. Blade Runner makes it clear who these controllers will be.And the film goes deeper. To create synthetic human beings the creators must be able to program the \"replicant's\" minds, that is control their reality. What is real or programming? The replicant does not know. It is virtual reality not in the arcade game world of The Matrix. Blade Runner predicts that science will be able to alter memories and thus reality. If a Corporation can alter a replicant's memories why not those of a naturally born human being? This issue is powerfully shown in Harrison Ford's scene at the piano which is covered in family photos, the symbol of memories.And the film goes deeper still. If \"machines\" are at least as smart as us, have feelings and are self aware, do they not deserve our respect and have rights? The tortured lives of two replicants illustrate this; Roy, the leader of the small slave revolt and Rachel, the pathetic female who does not know what she is and is later emotionally crushed by the truth.\nBlade Runner is more than a collection of ideas or a sharply accurate prediction of the future. It is a technical tour de force. These are the best sets (along with the many costumed extras) I have seen in a movie which truly create another world. The special effects, which are used to make this future more real, are very good. And the \"realism\" continues; How many typical Sci-fi heroes get hurt? In the typical Schwazenegger and now Matrix tradition the hero can get shot at by ten thousand bullets and not get a scratch. Blade Runner rightfully ignores this nonsense. Harrison Ford has to hunt down 3 very dangerous creatures and he gets hurt doing it! What a concept! It has been said that science fiction is mostly not about science but about fantasy. Blade Runner ignores this trend. It is very real and is masterfully crafted to create this reality and future. It is a grim prediction and is why this movie has never been a big hit, too much reality probably. I wouldn't have it any other way.

The first open sequence of the city is breathtaking, the flames, the buildings, specially Tyrell Corporation, all of this, brilliantly conducted by Vangelis soundtrack. To talk about this movie is to talk about the 3 essencial questions that the Human Being asks himself: \"Where do I come from? Where will I go? How long have I got left?\". This gives the movie it's philosofical perspective. The artifial world and the human specie are placed in this movie to show how dangerous it can get to \"play God\". The \"replicants\" are, supposedly, emocionally inexperient, flaw that is only possible to fix by memory implants. The end lines for Rutger Hauer brilliant performance prooves his humanity, perhaps this is the true theme of the movie: humanity, where does it starts, where does it ends, what boundries surround it and defines the human being? \"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe\", this is one of the most powerful moments of the entire film, the memories as builders of his emotions, his love for life...where is the boundry? The boundry that separates us from \"replicants\". Maybe life is just a constant quest for answers, those wich would reveal the meaning of life, death and our dawn. \"Blade Runner\" represents all of this brilliantly, and at the same time shows us a future, a dark and destructed future. Harrison Ford is excelent in the part of detective Deckard, a man in search of answers to his own questions, seeking those who threaten the human specie. During the movie he talks severall times about how \"blade runners\" musn't feel anything for the non-humans, but what better diplay of humanity than the one given by Rutger Hauer (Roy)?

It is the over-riding theme, though, which makes Blade Runner one of my favourite movies ever; that of mortality, lust for life, the transitory nature of one's being, the tragedy of self-awareness and love - it is all so fleeting.Though the movie tracks Deckard (Harrison Ford) pursuit and progressive execution of a group of rogue replicants (synthetic but fully feeling androids typically used as off-world slaves) that have escaped onto Earth, sympathy rests not with him but with the replicants themselves. Cursed with a three year lifespan and desperately trying to extend it by confronting their makers (the Tyrrell Corporation on Earth), their ebbing life (being hunted or simply expiring), the implicit vigour and understanding of the beauty of living is heart-wrenching.

What \"Star Wars\" did for the genre \"Blade Runner\" undid. It shows a dirty, ugly future much closer to the one we are approaching than any idealized version of the 21st century. Go to any major city street and it will look a lot more like \"Blade Runner\" Los Angeles than any other cityscape presented in sci-fi.Rutger Hauer gives the performance of a lifetime as Roy Batty. He is one of the greatest villains the movies have presented, right up there with Hopper in \"Blue Velvet\", Fonda in \"Once Upon a Time in The West\", or Darth Vader. The difference is Roy Batty is a sympathetic character who we as the audience come to realize is not really the bad guy. His intentions are completely understandable, even if the means to his end are not justifiable. His speech at the end of the film is the most memorable moment in the movie.Ridley Scott, the director, is a genius. That's all I'll say about that.Harrison Ford comes out of his superhero mode right after \"Raiders\" and \"Empire\" and plays a character he has rarely touched on before or since. Deckard is so unlike the usual Harrison Ford character, but he winds up being one of his best performances (though I'm partial to Indy in \"Raiders\", my other favorite movie). The important thing about Deckard is his sense of morality, or lack there of. You will see a metamorphosis unlike you may have thought Harrison Ford capable of.Warning: When the movie is over, remember to pick your jaw up off the floor, cause if you have any appreciation of movie genius, that's where your jaw will wind up. The film is breathtaking in it's visual beauty and mind boggling in it's commentary on humanity. I could explain it, but there is not enough time in the world.Please be sure to pick up the Director's Cut. It is literally a different movie than the one you may have seen prior to 1994. Not only different, but better by leaps and bounds.If I haven't said it already, I'll say it again: This is my favorite movie and one of the all time greatest!

Well, here we go anyway. Blade Runner is ultimate downer when it comes to visions of what the future. So many films have copied its style and imagery of a city drenched in a non-stop rain torrent illuminated by massive neon billboards its inhabitants most beyond redemption. (Terminator, Highlander, Robocop, The Fifth Element, and even Seven, the list is endless). It is ironic then that these films have enjoyed far more commercial success on first release than the film that inspired it. Ridley Scott can then smile that while most of these films, Highlander, Terminator and Robocop especially, have significantly dated, Blade Runner remains as fresh and original as it always was. The special effects, all done with models and matte work too, haven't changed. CGI is uncalled for; air brushing would nothing for a Monet. Ford is superb as Deckard, the embittered cop assigned without much choice to track down 4 rogue replicants. Ford hates the film, partly because he was almost killed in shooting and because he claims he played \"a detective who does no detecting and who just gives focus to Scott's sets\". This is untrue, the plot is compelling as Scott and the scriptwriters, David Peoples and Hampton Fancher transposed a Marlowe case in a dire future. However the plot takes second place to mood and atmosphere. Over the course of two hours we sniff great gulps of a hopeless future and mmmm! It tastes good! The film's countless sub-texts too are more prominent than the plot. The story is littered with clues as whether Deckard is a human or replicant and asks important questions such as who we are, what we're here for. Hauer, too is brilliant as Batty, the desperate replicant leader. It's a tragedy he never found a role that came anywhere close. Supporting players, Young, Sanderson and Hannah are superb to. But its Ridley Scott who takes all the glory. As well from having one of the coolest names in cinema, this is arguable his finest hour. His subtle direction HINTS at all the themes that he covers with no overt moralising and his awe inspiring visual genius and eye for detail was repeated in the brilliant, though criminally underrated 1492: Conquest of Paradise.

From this first scene, the whole movie sets up a great atmosphere that is not broken throughout the whole film. I sat enraptured, my eyes not moving from the screen for fear that I would miss something on screen. Okay, well, I admit that the first time I saw this movie I thought it was boring. Well, I was stupid and young. Now that it is out on DVD, I can enjoy it in all its film noir/sci-fi glory. By the way, this review is to the Director's Cut, which is the way it should be seen.It is 2019 and the technology of replicants has had some unexpected backfires. They look like humans; however, they are physically superior, if not mentally equal. A special police unit of Bladerunners has been created to combat this problem if they ever come to Earth. Deckard (Harrison Ford), is a retired Bladerunner who is brought back to track down and \"retire\" four replicants who sneaked into Earth. As he tracks the lead replicant (Rutger Hauer) and begins a love affair with a female experimental replicant, he begins to acquire clues that show him he may not be who he thinks he is..The acting in this movie is very good. Any movie with \"the man\" Harrison Ford seems to be good. Most of the emotional qualities of the characters seem flat, but that is what I would expect from the future that they live in. Harrison Ford is great as the Bladerunner Deckard, and Sean Young does well by playing his love interest Rachael. But Rutger Hauer does a really great job as a replicant who is desperate to survive.Let me just say that the special effects for this movie are really realistic, and they help get the feeling of an overblown gothic 50's city. The rest of the movie really does seem like it is during the post WWII years, but in a science fiction future. This movie is original and has the same qualities that make movies like The Matrix great. Any lover of science fiction should like this movie, but I know that it is not everyone's cup of tea. It is violent and it is slow moving, but it is beautifully shot, each scene done with care. I recommend it, and it is one of my favorite science fiction movies.

A science-fiction writer-critic once complained that Blade Runner is one of the most over-rated movies, arguing that it quite doesn\u00b4t live up to the book written by Philip K. Dick. Well, yes, it\u00b4s not as complex as the book itself, but I beg to differ. Blade Runner is one of the most UNDER-RATED movies ever. Only science-fiction fans talk about it, thus the movie is looked upon with arrogance by other genre\u00b4s fans and critics.Blade Runner tries, -and accomplishes it-, to be sober, realistic and ironic. Mixing action with calm, steady exposition, it brings the viewer the full view of a post-apocalyptic society, ranging from the high classes to the street level lives of some characters.You get slowly into the movie, experiencing a strange and cold environment, full of hightech gadgets (TV scanners, Videophones, hover-cars, androids, artificial animals, lie-emotion detectors, etc), and watch a detective-mistery-action-love story develop under a very firm and knowledgeable hand (Ridley Scott\u00b4s). The mistery and menace portraid by the androids (one of the focus of the film) remains throughout, gripping the viewer until the very end.The characters are well developed, the plot is complex and has interesting twists. Sometimes you want the detective to finish his job in a determined way, eliminating the cold threats he has in front; at other times, you can\u00b4t help but feel strangely sad as the detective becomes the predator against the threat (namely, against the first android woman, as she runs for her life).The action may be a little slow, but one knows that when something out of the ordinary flow of events happens, then the screen becomes the place for something thrilling. Whatever happens, Blade Runner never gets too violent; it portrays a possible reality. Having many layers of plot and great depth only emphasizes the greatness of this movie, rendering it realistic, dense and thought-provoking. Emphasis is given to the universal quest of finding out who we are, and when does reality, -life-, terminate.The acting is very good, from a \"I\u00b4m forced to do this\" attitude by Harrison Ford, to the ultra-sophistication of Sean Young. Rugter Hauer has one of his best performances ever, in this movie.The visual effects are good, even by today\u00b4s standards, making certain that the movie stays within \"realism\" boundaries.It\u00b4s an intriguing, hypnotic movie. It does not offend the book, albeit being different from it. It\u00b4s worth seeing again and again, and, if you think of all the sequels happening with some movies (not referring to Star Wars, of course), well worth some kind of continuation (meaning, of course, sequel...). But I doubt this will ever happen. Maybe it\u00b4s best this way, who knows? Anyway, this movie is part of my big and wonderful movies constelation: Star Wars, Alien, Dark City, The Matrix.

It was originally a novel called \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\" written by Phillp K. Dick in 1968. Blade Runner was released theatrically in 1982, it only made around $31 Million, and costed more then $39 to make. After all those years, Blade Runner the directors cut was released in 1992. Blade Runner eventually became a sci-fi classic after all that time, and is still not reconized by many people. Upon multiple viewings Blade Runner has proven to be the biggest sci-fi acheivement in Sci-Fi history of this century. Ridley Scott is was the genius behind this film, for once I actually liked a movie better then it's novel. The novel \"DaDoES\" was also great, but it was very different from the movie, it takes place in a different time, 2021 AD to be exact. Every moment in this film is just great, the speech was brilliant. The acting was superb, especailly Ruther Hauer, who did an outstanding job. Lots of other sci-fi films come close, such as 2001, Alien, Ghost In The Shell, Akira, Metropolis, Star Wars, The Matrix, but Blade Runner has proven to the best. Here's why I think Blade Runner is the best film ever made.First off, the set designs we're great! Syd Mead is genius to come up with such amazing ideas. Ridley Scott's world just looks brillant! I guess Ridley Scott wanted to show how the world will look in 2019. He made it look great, it looks great to us, but to the people there, it wouldn't be so great after all. The movie is generally dark and has a spooky atmosphere to it. The backgrounds we're very nicely done, not only the background, hell the people even looked great in the backgrounds! We get to see a few scenes where we can see very strange types of people walking around the rainy metropolis, a good example is the one where Deckard is chasing Zhora and jumpiong from building to building, car to car. This can't be seen in too many other movies, actually this was the first time it was ever shown. I was so amazed by the set designs and cinematography, I couldn't believe it was made in 1982. First time I saw this movie I was only 11 (im 15 at the moment), and I wasn't watching it carefully, I was more paying attention to the backgrounds. I was so amazed and dazzled at how great they looked, especially at scene in the Tyrell Building. The spinner scenes also looked amazing, the spinners looked *really* real, except you could tell that they we're computer generated at part where Gaff and Deckard are going to the Tyrell Corporation. Another great example was the scene when Leon and Batty are about the enter Chew's Eye Works, notice the background, and the how those oriental people come riding on there bikes, I found that pretty cool. The scene where Gaff and Deckard are going to the Police Headquarters was one of the best! The effects looked so real, and to top it off, it had great music. Animod Row looked great, lots of strange people in the backgrounds as well. The Tyrell Building was looked so cool, I could almost swear it was real. I've never seen such great Cinematography and Set Designs, and I don't suppose I ever will, until there is a Blade Runner 2.The music used in Blade Runner was easily the best I've heard in a movie. I don't know where to begin telling you how great it was. Every scene in Blade Runner just had amazing music, and it wasn't the same one used over and over (aka. Star Wars, Ghost In The Shell). The intro track is really good, it gives Los Angeles 2019 a great feel, it's also used in the scene where Deckard and Gaff are going to the Tyrell Corporation. Then the music in the scene where Deckard and Gaff fly to the Police Headquarters is amazing! It's less then two mins. but still it was *really* good. Another good track was Blade Runner Blues, which was used in the scene where Pris first comes in the movie, that's probably the best music though out the movie. Memories of Green was really really good!! It was used at the scene where Deckard picks up Rachael's picture that she throws on the floor after finding out that she is a replicant herself. I enjoyed the track Love Theme which was played in Deckard's apartment after Leon attacks Deckard in the ally. End Titles was just amazing, it was the track played at the end of the movie, during the credits. I also enjoyed On Trail of A Nexus 6, which plays in the background when Deckard is chasing Leon. A track that didn't make it to the cd, was the one which plays when Deckard is about to perform a Voight-Kampff test on Rachael, that's too bad since that music sounded great.The character in Blade Runner were really well put together, I don't care what anyone says. Harrison Ford played Rick Deckard, the main character of the movie. His character was great! His acting was superb, his face expressions we're really good. Deckard was shown to be a not-so-great man overall. His wife and child had even left him, but those we're just his memories if he was a replicant, which I believe he was. Ruther Hauer was easily the best actor of the film. Not did he only do a good job of acting, he looked pretty damned cool, especially at the scene at Chew's Eye Works. He played Roy Batty, one of the escaped Replicants lurking the streets of LA 2019. He did an academy winning performance, from the start of the movie, all the way to the end. His end line was just amazing, I don't know anyone else who could have played a better Roy Batty. Sean Young who played Rachael, did a damn good job. Her acting was great, and she always didn't seem human at times, I don't know how they did that. The rest of the cast did a great job, Edward James Olmos who played Gaff did an outstanding job, he didn't have much lines, but still he was just great in that role. Joe Turkel who played Eldon Tyrell did a real good job, who was shown like he was pratically playing god. Brion James who played Leon, didn't really have a big part of the film, but he did great. He did a good job at the start of the movie where Holden is questioning him, he acting like he was confused, and it was brillant. William Sanderson played J.F Sebastian, who did an alright job of acting though out the movie, could have been better, but some parts of his were great, especially the scene where he says that his glands grow old too fast. Robert Okazak who passed away a few years ago played the sushi master at the resturant at the start of the movie, for some reason I found him to be one of the greatest actors in the movie, espeically when he said that wonderful line \"He Say Your Brade Runna\", that was just amazing acting. The rest of the cast who had minor roles did a good/excellent job of acting, which isn't seen too often in Sci-Fi movies (aka. The 13th Floor, Total Recall, Star Wars).I found Blade Runner to be the most amazing movie ever made. Almost everything about it was perfect, except for the few flaws. Even today's effects can't match Blade Runner's, no not even Star Wars, sure they look more \"cool\", but do they look real? Hellno. Similar backgrounds from Blade Runner are used in many Sci-Fi movies and shows around these days (aka. Akira, Total Recall 2070), but they will never match Blade Runner. Ridley Scott and Syd Mead did something which no one else can ever replica. Blade Runner was nominated for best special effects, but didn't win, but it went on to win 3 UK Academy Awards. Blade Runner was also mentioned at the 1999 Academy's when they were showing the best films, it showed a spinner fly by LA 2019. I can't wait to see the sequel if there is one, which there should be around 2002, if they are making one.

It's \"2001\" for action fans.The plot (skip to the next paragraph if you don't want spoilers) goes like this: synthetic people called replicants, stationed on the \"off-world,\" are upset with their second-banana position in society and their limited life spans (apparently they were becoming too human), and rebel. They kill a bunch of their human supervisors -- by the way, all this happens before the story begins -- and head to L.A. to meet their maker (get it?), to ask him to extend their life spans past four years.

After this, he (the replicant) expires and shuts down. Deckard returns to his apartment to see if Rachel is still alive. The ambiguous ending tells us that the couple may or may not be hunted by Gaff (Edward James Olmos, playing the Claude Rains role).For those who find the Greater Meanings to messy, inconsistent, disorganized and overcooked (like me) can still enjoy those primo visuals, and maybe even the Vangelis score, but they probably won't have much fun otherwise. There isn't much in the way of action sequences, though Ridley Scott does include plenty of shooting, bone breaking, skull crushing and eye gouging, and the story is pretty illogical (part of that can be blamed on the altering of some of Philip K. Dick's original ideas).

It fulfills one of my requirements of great films in that I walked out of the theater a different person than when I entered. And it fulfilled another requirement in that it improved with repeated viewings.There is so much to take in visually, intellectually, and emotionally that my mind was overwhelmed at the first viewing trying to sort it all out. Unlike the so-called \"entertainment\" we get today at the movies, this film didn't spoonfeed its meaning to you. It left the ending ambiguous so your imagination has to supply it.The film demands discussion. There are so many topics to debate. Is Deckard a replicant? Do Deckard and Rachel live happily ever after? Why is there a unicorn in the director's cut? Is Deckard a hero? Or are the replicants really the good guys? Every time I watch it, my answers change.I may be one of the few that really likes the original. Probably because I've seen that version a couple dozen times since 1982 before the director's cut came out. This may contradict what I said earlier about being spoonfed, but I liked the narration because it explained what was going on in Deckard's mind. And I didn't mind the \"happy ending\" because it still implied that their troubles may not be over. \"I don't know how long we had together. Who does?\" But with that version memorized, I now appreciate the directors cut. It probably has the better ending. (At least I think so until I view it again!)It's also fun watching actors before they became more famous later like Sean Young, Daryl Hannah, M. Emmet Walsh, William Sanderson, and Edward James Olmos. I think they all did a great job. And Vangelis did a beautiful, moving score.After \"Blade Runner\", most of the big blockbuster science fiction movies boil down to good guys vs. bad guys with lots of loud explosions and in-your-face effects. Very simplistic messages, if any. That's why I still contend that an \"oldie\" like Blade Runner still outshines them all. It has incredible special effects, but never at the expense of the story. The cityscapes do more than dazzle you, they involve you.The more I think of it, the more I realize that \"Blade Runner\" is not only my favorite science fiction movie, but one of my favorite films in any genre.

The scene where Deckhard flies into the police headquarters has a sense of Odyssey, a feel of a visionary perspective into a possible future, that makes the film not just an audio-visual experience, but a true journey of discovery into a very different world.Secondly, the (Vangelis) soundtrack is incredible. Words fail to express the quality of the soundtrack, which beautifully adds to the \"immenseness\" of the visuals.

Harrison Ford only goes as far as to put on the cocky grin that he is famous for, and the occasional voice-overs that drop in every now and then are both unnecessary and uninspiring (director Ridley Scott was wise enough to cut the voice-overs from the recent Director's Cut version).Poor acting aside, the film drives itself along solely on its basic premise: that being the questioning of reality. The story, adapted from classic sci-fi writer Phillip K. Dick, pulls the viewer in through excellent scenes such as where Deckart goes over some fragments of Rachel's memories, thereby revealing to her that she is an android, and the soliloquy delivered beautifully by Roy Batty as he takes his last breath. One can't help but be moved by the chilling revelation of discovering that a whole lifetime of memories has been a lie, to be aware of your existence as only a machine.Whereas other science-fiction movies are mostly a combination of action and special effects, BladeRunner goes the extra step to provide the emotional effect which the movie viewer carries with him after the film is over.I gave it an 8.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Excellent Science-Fiction Film", "date": "1999-07-20T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0191632"}, {"content": "This film is a part of my life, for the better and for the worst.

It is a facinating dystopian view of the future, all with a single burning question at the forefront: What makes us human?Ridley Scott's vision of a Los Angeles in 2019 still haunts me. The first time I saw the LA skyline at night driving down Interstate 5, the images of the first frames of this film came to mind, and I nearly wrecked my car!If you have not seen this film yet, watch the \"original\" version first, complete with running narrative and happy ending (forget the \"extended version\" with gratuitious violence). Then watch (and savor) the letterboxed (widescreen) Director's Cut, and see how a great film was made better. There's less blood and guts, no narration, and, yes, the dream sequence (with the unicorn) plays an important part. Take note as to the origami folding Deckart finds at the end of the film! It answers (as well as asks) many questions that were never mentioned in the original version.The two most impressive moments for me are Leon Kowalsaki (Brion James)'s classic paradox (\"Wake up! Time to die!\"), and Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer)'s death speech. Hauer literally stole the scene (the words \"like tears in rain\" were ad-libbed!), and the sylloquy literally moved me to tears. After all these years, and all the times I've seen this film, it still does! All Roy wanted was to be human, and he could only find his humanity in death.To hell with what Leonard Maltin thinks of this film!

Isn't it strange that a lot of masterpieces are made in times of such strife (see Apocalypse Now, Easy Rider, The Shining and The Exorcist.)Yes, I said masterpiece. At first I didn't think it was either. A good film, maybe even a great one, but a masterpiece? Never. The Directors Cut did nothing to change my opinion when it was first released. Now it's easily my favourite science fiction film and quite possibly the finest film that deals with the meaning of identity ever made. Especially the D.C.The script may have been written and rewritten but lets face it, it was worth the wait. There are so many marvelous lines and wonderful scenes it boggles the mind. Hampton Fanchers original draft was okay but it was never as good as David Peoples re-write. The script also hints at deeper meanings behind the obvious. When Batty says \"Show me what you're made of\" what exactly does he mean? Is it a straight challenge or a reference to Deckards origins?That's a matter I could never resolve. Is Deckard a replicant? When I watched it the first time there was never a moment I doubted his humanity but after reading other peoples views I find it harder to stick to that. Maybe I'll never know. Maybe Ridley Scott didn't want us to. Scott's touch is undoubtedly the guiding light behind the film. The themes and techniques he used in Alien are exploited here to the full. Syd Mead may have designed that horrible city of the future but Scotts lens never quite manages to damn it. He gives the cold streets a dangerous, foreboding look but finds time for great warmth as well in Deckards apartment. He's helped by Vangelis' marvelous score which fills every scene with such emotion and power it's impossible not to be moved.Harrison Ford may hate the film, Sean Young may have hated working on it but there's no doubt that they and Rutger Hauer give career best performances. It's such a shame that Young and Hauer went into a career nosedive after this that neither have recovered from. The rest of the cast do their jobs admirably as well but Ford comes up trumps. Forget Witness, the Star Wars' or anything else he's done. This is as good as he's been.Perhaps the best way to judge a films affect on the industry is to see how many times it's been imitated. How many times has BladeRunners view of the future been ripped off? Too many. How many have looked as good? With the exception of The Matrix (maybe), none of them. BladeRunners most famous aspect is it's cynical view of what the metropolis will look like once we're finished wih it. But it's not its best. It's the way it constantly questions what being human is and what humans are meant to be and humans are meant to do that I love so much. In this film man plays God by creating a being in its own image. Man wants to control the being. The being does not want to be controlled. It retaliates. Is this a moral or a warning?

Anyone who doesn't agree with this statement should watch Metropolis, 1984 and Judge Dredd, so you get into the mood, and then watch Blade Runner. Then perhaps you will enjoy.This film is relaxed in it's approach: summing up the mood of Harrison Ford's character, Deckard, who wants to retire and move at his own pace. It is also dark and mean in some respects giving a bleak vision of a dark future: a future where man's idea of playing God has no certainty and comes back to haunt him.Blade Runner is perhaps portrayed from Deckards point of view that life in the dark and nasty bleak rat race is a pointless exercise and existence and that new pastures must be found.Some parts of the film are outstanding in every sense: the chase around the apartments between Deckard and Rutgar Hauers character, the replicant Roy Batty, the scene where Deckard is saved from a long fall by the man he is assigned to terminate (i.e. Roy Batty), the images of the flying police vehicle, shots of the immense and gigantic Tyrrell Corp. Building, the dark and creepy images of the toys and little people in JD's apartment where the silence and eerie atmosphere combine and the final scenes where Deckard goes out to the countryside ((played by a fresh faced Sean Young) a one-off replicant who has no time limit to her life span).

Unlike anime, BR shows the foolishness of unnecessary violence rather then exploit it. The story, which deals with Deckard (Harrison Ford), the special futuristic bounty hunter hired to track down a group of escaped androids is the perfect example of a look at humanity. The androids are made out to be evil, but in reality it's their creator Tyrell who truly is the wicked one.This story is excellent, the androids are all sympathetic (remember, the crime they commit is wanting to be more human), and you will feel heartbroken at the end of the movie when you hear Deckard's mental soliloquy concerning the fate of Batty, the lead android. Ridley Scott really outdid himself with this picture, which is one of my favorite sci-fi flicks along with They Live.It is a shame that in today's society trashy animated films which rely totally on gore and sex to entertain rather then actual human development are so popular, while films such as this are left to neglect simply because people view it as something Harrison Ford did to kill time between \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" and \"Return of the Jedi\".If you have not seen it, then watch this movie at once.

Of course I have subjected myself to both versions, and of course the Director's Cut is better, but still this is beside the point. For a film made seventeen years ago and culminating with the kind of visceral fascination and kinetic cinemania that this one inspires is almost unheard of. We could get into arguments about the relative outdatedness of even the most classic of films (even those nifty hippie-inspired stewardess wardrobes in Kubrick's \"2001\" look hopelessly tacky today); \"Blade Runner\" however, still holds its own. A beautiful piece of cinema, everything in this film comes together like clockwork. Jordan Croenworth's cinematography, Douglas Trumbull's special effects, the performances of Harrison Ford (who showed his relative worth as an actor first in this film, not Peter Weir's \"Witness\"), Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah and Sean Young at her most soulful, and most notably, Ridley Scott's meticulous direction make this one of the great films. How could I forget Vangelis's score? Who could dispute the evocative dreaminess of the scene where Young lets her hair down at the piano as Vangelis's electronic palette of eerily beautiful melancholia reaches its crescendo? Or the bluesy overtones of the scene where Ford analyzes a photograph and cries of childhood are subliminally heard in the background? Or in one of the most poignant sequences in cinematic history, at the end on the rooftop, the perfect combination of music, imagery and dialogue. Don't get me wrong, I believe \"2001\" to be a film of enormous versimilitude; it is quite possibly the greatest sci-fi of all time (it is certainly the most ambitious); \"Blade Runner\" though creating a world with as much ingenuity and pizazz as ever before seen in cinema, is a much more subtle work and offers an opposing side as to the haunting effect of cinema; Scott's direction at least deserved an Oscar nomination, as did the film itself, the cinematography, the music, the film editing and the sound (they all failed to resound a single nod in all of the aforementioned categories). The only other sci-fi film I would compare this to as to having the same subtle reach and beautiful realization of cinematic artistry would be Peter Weir's \"The Truman Show\", a film which is, like \"Blade Runner\", less science fiction and more of a foretelling of things to come. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences must not like being reminded of the gloom and doom that the world is apparently headed toward: I don't blame them, for it's nice to think of a world with no conceivable problems. But their relative lack of any type of cinematic appreciation is unforgivable especially in the past few years: the comforting strains of \"Gandhi\" and \"E.T.\" over \"Blade Runner\"?

It was the first big sci-fi film since \"Star Wars\" and its sequels and was unjustly compared to these very different kinds of sci-fi movies. It is only recently that it has been recognised as a great film. Its original soundtrack was unavailable until recently as well.I remember watching the Academy Awards and being disappointed by the nominations and the results. Didn't Vangelis' (\"Chariots of Fire\", \"Missing\") deserve a nod for best film score? \"Blade Runner\" was nominated for best visual effects and, as usual, the Academy went for the SENTIMENTAL favourite, much less deserving of an Oscar. \"Blade Runner\" had virtually a whole city created by a computer (computer graphics weren't as easy to generate back in 1982!) while, the winner of the Oscar, \"E.T.\", simply had some kids ride bicycles in the air.\"Blade Runner\" was not a film with a complicated and original plot with surprises and twists randomising the heart-rate of the viewer sitting propped up on the edge of his seat. Nor did the film have intensive dialogue and interesting characters. Its plot was simple. Its script was concise (although there are some memorable lines). Its characters were somewhat plain (except, perhaps, for J.F. Sebastian). But all these were meant to be, for Blade Runner was not intended to be a high-powered drama; it was meant to be an artistic masterpiece, a film about ambience and atmosphere, a film directed at creating particular moods in the viewer, a film intended to dazzle the eye and exhilarate the ear. And it succeeded at these aims marvellously. It is art and film noir at its best.A gloomy, dark, rainy, depressing Los Angeles, in the future, is the scene of a \"blade runner\" assigned to bump off rebellious \"replicants\" - artificial life forms created for slave labour in space. The film opens with columns of fire spouting into the air next to flying automobiles and chillingly smooth melodic synthesisers from the composer Vangelis. It is crowded, smoky, and various ethnic languages have melded together in the local Creole dialect. I liked the idea, also, of the umbrella stems being fluorescent lights.\"Blade Runner\" seemed to be a blessing on the actors that played in it; for, many unknowns became famous after the film and had the good fortune of winning roles in blockbusters. Rutger Hauer who plays the leader of the replicants became well known and starred in \"The Hitcher\". Sean Young, until this film, unknown, appeared in such films as \"Dune\", \"Wall Street\", and \"No Way Out\" with Kevin Costner. Darryl Hannah, another unknown, made it big in \"Splash\", \"Roxanne\", and teamed up with Sean Young again in \"Wall Street\". Edward James Olmos emerged from obscurity and acquired the role of the police chief in TV's Miami Vice series. He won a number of Emmy Awards. William Sanderson became \"Larry\" of \"Larry, Darrel and my other brother Darrel\" in the TV series Newhart.I was sorely disappointed with the Director's cut of the film. One would expect a D-Cut to ADD footage, but footage was only removed - Rick Deckard's voiced over dubbing, the ending, and so on. All that was added was some silly dream of a unicorn. LEAVE THE ORIGINAL CUT ALONE!!! The D-Cut took away from the film's charm. Again: Leave the original cut alone! Why mess with it? DON'T!I wish that more films were made in a similar spirit to \"Blade Runner\". Recently, \"Dark City\" re-captured some of its charm of it but lacked much of the old \"Blade Runner magic\", a great score to name but one lacking element.

I have seen every important sci-fi movie, and personally, Blade Runner reveals itself to be a superior film.\nSpace Odyssey and Alien come close, but they do not hold up as well as Blade Runner upon multiple viewings. Space Odyssey tends to lull in its more psychedelic moments, leaving one with a feeling of confused longing. No matter how many theories are expounded based on the content of the film, its ultimate meaning will remain ever-ambiguous, as Kubrick intended it to be. Alien is weakened by its inability to reach the viewer on a higher philosophical plane. The suspense in the film is nearly unparalleled, and Sigourney Weaver is fantastic, but it falls short of the excellence displayed in Blade Runner.\nLet me explain why Blade Runner is my favorite:\nThe most striking aspect of the film is its cinematography. There is nothing but genius in the shooting of every scene. The use of shadows and low camera angles bears an uncanny resemblance to the cinematography of Citizen Kane. My favorite shot is when we get our first glimpse into Tyrell's office. The lighting effects in all of that set's scenes are fantastic.(especially when the windows become tinted). Please note that the lame-brains at the academy did not nominate Blade Runner for Best Cinematography. How stupid can you get?\nBehind every film is the Director's vision, and in this film, Ridley Scott displays incredible vision. His conception of a futuristic LA, as characterized by the inevitable demographics of the future, is what allows the film to transcend its era and remain appreciated in the future. Many of the themes in the movie originate from the sci-fi novel (which carries an absurd title that does not obey the rules of logic:one does not dream of sheep; one thinks of sheep in an attempt to achieve a state of dream), yet the manner in which those themes are presented brings about the full genius of Ridley Scott. (How many Hardcore rock fans know where the phrase \"more human than human\" comes from?) Through the example of the replicants, Scott exposes the human sin of taking life for granted. Furthermore, he asks: what does it mean to be human? Do we have a false vision of our own morality as a race? Do we ignore our own evils? Can we play God as Tyrell attempts to do? The complexity of all these questions allows for many viewings of the film.And then, of course, there are the actors. None of them stand out in their roles, and yet the acting is perfect. Harrison Ford plays Deckard, the misanthropic ex-cop, who comes off as a veritable anti-hero. Sean Young plays Rachel, the incredibly human replicant that steals his heart. Rutger Hauer plays Roy, the umistakably Aryan leader of the replicants. All three of them deserved Oscar nominations. The other minor roles are superb as well.Finally, Blade Runner would not be itself without the Vangelis soundtrack. It has a wonderful mood-controlling effect throughout the film. I especially like the Blade Runner Blues, and Rachel's song.\nI think that anybody who's read through my entire comment gets the point: I love this movie and I find it to be the best. If you haven't seen it, get over to the video store NOW!!! For first time viewers be sure to get the original version. When you have become familiar enough with the plot, go see it as it was meant to be, (without the voice-over), and rent the director's cut.

These two philosophical inquiries are explored at great length in Ridley Scott's \"Blade Runner\" The film is based on Philip K. Dick's great novel \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" The inquiries that I have just mentioned were originally present in the novel, and despite much academic criticism, they are also present in \"Blade Runner\"In a sense, it is difficult to discuss the film without discussing in terms of the novel, so I will make constant comparisons in this review. Many critics have argued that the awesome visual effects and stylish cinematography overwhelm the content of the story and themes. This response is not entirely uncommon, despite the huge cult following the \"Blade Runner\" has accumulated. The film does not deserve such criticism. On a second viewing of the film, the spectacular effects do not overwhelm the story. We can understand that the visuals depicting Los Angeles in the year 2019 help to advance the themes. Many critics miss the human side of the story, or lack there of, and may object to the powerful visuals for this reason. It can be argued that the visuals serve to portray a dehumanized world where only subtle signs of humanity's existence are dispersed throughout, where existentialist notions such as what being human is and what being human means are not easily answered. In a way, each medium reinforces the other. There are many obvious differences between the novel and the film, but they essentially complement one another in result.\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" has two primary themes, which are also present in \"Blade Runner\". The first is what constitutes the essential human being and how we distinguish the essential human being from that which only masquerade as human. And the second theme is that if you fight evil, you will wind up becoming evil. In the film, we have the character of Deckard who is becoming more and more dehumanized throughout the story, and the replicants are becoming more and more human.

I melt when she first comes on to the screen in her first scene as she is walking across the floor at the Tyrell Corp. and asks Decker, \"Do you like our owl?\" Lastly, my favorite scene is when Rachel let's her hair down, starts to play the piano and when Decker sits next to her and tells her that she plays beautifully, she gets up and starts to leave his apartment (for the 2nd time).

It is not a traditional sci-fi movie, it's a touching drama about the value of life and the importance of making the most of what you've got. One of the most important themes in the film is the question of what is more valuable - humans without emotions, or machines with? The film gives no answer - it just opens our eyes and makes us aware that we should be grateful for being alive.Some people prefer the Director's Cut, but I like the original version better - mostly because of the wonderful end line: \"I didn't know how long we had together. Who does?\" That pretty much sums it up.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 271, "votes": 370}, "heading": "A futuristic allegory about the value of life", "date": "1998-12-07T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0191350"}, {"content": "It's nice to see a good science fiction story treated as a real story.

Classic or FX mayhem? Some critics tore it to shreds some lifted it up to God and said, \" Look, Ridley made you a gift!\".After watching BladeRunner too many times to remember through a love of the movie I have also studied it indepth for a college class, which opened up BladeRunner to me than ever before. It has underlying meanings in it even if Ridley Scott did not put them there intentionally they are there. It brings moral questions of can life be ended even if it was man made? These are questions that are irrelevant to us now concerning synthetic humans but BladeRunner gives us insight to what may come of our world, it shows a bleak and dark world covered in mist, all created by visualist Miede, combined with incredible music by Vangelis, together they combine to show us a world that does not seem too flavorful. The people that are left on the BladeRunners world are the outcasts, people who are forbidden or cannot afford to go \"Off World\". In the novel by the great Philip K Dick these people are called Chickenheads. People aimlesly walking around with no real purpose anymore.The performances in BladeRunner are excellent, even though there was little friendship between some of the actors and to the director none of it shows on the screen. For example, Harrison Ford and Sean Young detest each other in life but on screen they have a great chemistry as star crossed lovers. Ford didn`t completely get along with Scott Either. And still to this day Ford says that this was never his best work but enjoyed it none the less. Possibly this is Rutget Hauers best performance as to date, it took him less than 1 minute to be directly cast as Roy Batty as he walked into interview room clad in a leather coat and ready bleached blond hair.If you have never seen this movie before you must, but maybe for the less enthusiatic Sci-Fi watcher the general release version would be better with the voice over helping to explain the plot, but for the experienced and open minded watcher should watch the directors cut, the letterbox edition is beautiful and shows exactly how Scott wanted you to see it. In my eyes it is a true classic, but judge for yourself, and wonder if the haunting world of the BladeRunner is the future of our world. And for the watchers of the Directors Cut...

Always dark, always raining, the Earth of Bladerunner is an eerie mixture of Gothic, art deco, pseudo-Japanese high tech and downtown slum. It's gritty, it's noir...it even has a Chandler-esque (Raymond, not Friends) voice-over: apparently added to make the plot easier to understand and, in my opinion, erroneously deleted from the Director's Cut.It is the basic premise of the film, however, that, challenges one the most: do machines created to be human, with human emotions and freedom of action, remain the property of their creators or should they be free. Almost subconsciously the film makes the audience deal with the question of slavery, and really makes one realise how precious the time we have to spend with our loved ones is.Harrison Ford superbly plays his usual \"ordinary Joe trying to do right\", but it is Rutger Hauer who shines the most. As Roy Batty, leader of the Replicants, he achieves just the right mix of ruthless but vulnerable. He also gets all the best lines!See Bladerunner on the big screen if you can: if only for the soaring views of future LA seen from above and the post-climax \"light from the dark\" ending.

The voice over in the theatrical release is unnecesary and the \"happy ending\" that the studio had tacked on has been cut. Also there is the odd question raised on the back of the movie cover that Deckard may himself be a replicant. Something to do with the unicorn dream. As for the performances, all the actors are excellent, especially Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer who incidentally is grossly under-rated as an actor. The man is great in Blade Runner.

If you love the movie, I'm with you, but the damn thing ALWAYS makes me cry; so after about the tenth time I watched it over a 10 year period (I drink when I watch it) I finally realised that besides the very incredible cast, and the interesting story, there was something else swilling around at the bottom of the movie that inevitably made me blub at the end. Sean Young is gorgeous of course, but so? The real message of the movie is this: that Deckard [the protaganist], could fall in love with an android - something pretty much against ALL his training. By the end of the movie we see that people [you, me, the protagonist] can fall in love with anything, just so long as it is able to capture your heart. It is THE movie that is totally anti-bigot, that strips taboo down to raw emotion and declares \"if your heart WANTS this, you won't be able to stop it\". It is a movie about forbidden love, taboo, intrigue, death and life: pretty juicy stuff. And the unspoken message is simply 'people will give their hearts away to whoever will pay their price, and furthermore, they won't be able to help themselves'. Because, if you remember, ol' Sean is just a machine - an appliance really, a big, complicated vaccuum cleaner with an incredibly great face, but still a machine; just a machine. And to prove the point, there he is, the android Roy Batty who in the end loved life so much that he would not even take the life of his would-be killer. It's THAT message about the individual: that the Nazi can fall in love with the beautiful Jewish chick; that the militant black guy can be transfixed by the innocent white girl; that the boundaries of race or creed or color, or even of flesh and blood, are actually no boundaries at all... that if Deckard can cross them, anybody can. He falls in love with an android, and shows us that no matter how you were trained or raised or brought up, there is the possibility of love... that somewhere in time, even if we are \"sushi\" - even if we are cold fish - we can love anything, or anyone.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 2}, "heading": "these are just comments - but it IS the best film I've ever seen", "date": "1998-10-03T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0191602"}, {"content": "The Director's Cut of this classic 1982 film is simply masterful.

An excellent well thought-out cast of characters, add as much depth and detail to the story, as Sid Mead did to the visuals. The unmatched cinematography, and stunning visual presence intertwine perfectly with the multiple layers of philosophical thought & questioning that make up the story.

Dick, BLADE RUNNER must be ranked as one of, if not the, greatest visual achievements in the history of cinema. Directed by Ridley Scott (Alien), the story focuses on Los Angeles, 2019. A film-noir technopunk verisimilitude dominates in this time, as large blimps extoll the virtues of going \"off-world,\" while the majority of people live in pollution and towering pyramid buildings, where strobe lights of various hovercrafts wind across gothic stone gargoyles, where the sun never seems to rise and the torrents of rain never stop. The culture of Los Angeles seems to naturally grow from our present time; there is a large Asian and Hispanic community and culture. Deckard (played with a splendidly Marlowean low-key by Harrison Ford) is a \"Blade Runner\"- cops specially trained to eliminate illegal off-world worker androids who run amok on earth. The leader of the \"replicants,\" Roy (Rutger Hauer), seek only a chance to live beyond their pre-determined deaths. As Deckard descends further and further into the hunt through the seedy streets, he also discovers a most unusual love interest-- a legal android (Sean Young) who refuses to believe her memories are fake. As mentioned before, BLADE RUNNER has a wonderfully unique vision of the future, created by visualist Syd Meier, that every science fiction film from RUNAWAY to THE FIFTH ELEMENT has \"borrowed,\" to put it nicely. However, what truly makes the story compelling is the quest for humanity, and what truly makes us human. If at all possible, view the Director's Cut: the ending is completely different, more realistic, and ultimately more powerful.
