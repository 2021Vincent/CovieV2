Unfortunately, it feels a bit like trying to watch multiple TV screens at once - great if you enjoy a galactic case of whiplash, but far less so if you prefer your movies to have a clear protagonist.The creators took a bold step into the narrative unknown, choosing to spotlight every Guardian's story simultaneously, much like Avatar 2. Sadly, the result is a filmic dish whose individual ingredients are delectable, yet when combined, induce a sense of cosmic indigestion. Rocket's story orbits at the center, yet it feels like an anecdote in a tale that's meant to be about everyone and no one in particular. Immersion takes a back seat as we, the audience, are left floating in a zero-gravity void of emotional disconnect.On the emotional side, this galactic opus comes across like an organ grinder cranking the handle of sentimentality, using every trick in the book to elicit feeling but leaving the audience as cold as Pluto.The Guardians' third outing resembles nothing less than a cinematic Frankenstein's monster. It stumbles between tones, veering from near-horror to slapstick childishness with the grace of a one-legged Celestial. It's akin to an ill-conceived roller-coaster ride that can't decide whether to scare you or make you laugh.Moreover, our galactic heroines, Nebula, Gamora, and Mantis (though Mantis less so), seem to be embroiled in their own version of \"The Red Bull Chronicles.\" Their overly caffeinated, confrontational behaviors paint them as one-dimensional space rednecks, sidelining their previously established character depth. It's a sad sight as they devolve into irksome caricatures of themselves.Perhaps the biggest blow comes from the stark departure from the first two films. Our familiar guardians have been replaced by alien (and not in a good way) versions of themselves, creating a disconnection that has all the subtlety of a supernova.Despite its stumbles, the film does manage to mine some gold from the asteroid field. Drax delivers his usual razor-sharp humor, Mantis shows a glimmer of depth, and the cameo adds an unexpected twist to the cosmic soup.In summary, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 might appeal to those with a taste for narrative chaos and character disarray. However, for this viewer, it was a leap too far into the galactic unknown, leaving behind the charm and balance of its predecessors. The score? One star for Drax and one for the cameo, but overall, this is one sequel that fails to launch.", "rating": 2, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3: An Astral Misadventure", "date": "2023-05-18T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9062856", "sentiment score": [0.0478, 0.3696, 0.3919, 0.1769, 0.0137]}, {"content": "The third installment of the Guardians of the Galaxy franchise does not disappoint.

In spite of being a part of this universe, \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" have always stood apart from the rest of superhero movies. It's because of the heartwarming atmosphere, amazing soundtrack, humor, ironic attitude of the characters and exciting space battles.It is all the more surprising that the final part of the trilogy, directed by James Gann, turned out to be darker and more dramatic than expected. The film raised essential questions about the place of individuals in a huge evil world, the absurdity of the idea of an ideal society, and the importance of the life of every species as well. Even though the creators used obviously manipulated techniques to play on the emotions of the viewer, I would say that storyline of Rocket the Raccoon is the main advantage of the film and it really touches you. And I can't help saying that story wouldn't be so emotional and terrifying without an amazing voice acting cast.However, the main theme of the third volume is definitely friendship. Star Lord is no longer the main character and Gann has focused on developing all the team characters.The main cast, Dave Batista (Drax), Mantis (Pom Klementieff), and Karen Gillan (Nebula), got more screen time, they performed brilliantly and look very harmonious. Above all, Chukwudi Iwuji was fantastic as the villain. The High Evolutionary, creating a new world inhabited by a perfect race, makes you hate him. Although he is absolutely disgusting because of his actions, he is still attractive at the same time. I could add him to the collection of the most unpleasant villains from the comics.'Guardians' cause empathy and they sincerely please you with their appearance on the screen. The visual effects team did an amazing job bringing to life the fantastical universe. And what's more, the view of bio-structural planet was breathtaking and I felt like a child looking at the pictures in an anatomy book for the first time. The film ends very poetically with the song that opened the first film.In my opinion, this is a very worthy conclusion to the story, the best film of the trilogy, and one of the best films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 4, "votes": 4}, "heading": "89P13", "date": "2023-05-18T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9062661", "sentiment score": [0.0066, 0.0362, 0.1111, 0.5422, 0.3039]}, {"content": "I agree wholeheartedly with those reviewers who cite Vol 3 as the weakest of the GotG trilogy, which is a shame, because it could have been great.There was much to enjoy here, but equally there were elements that left me frustrated over what were, in my view, some poor choices of tone and direction.The main problems I had with this outing were two-fold: too much shouting (like being subjected to an episode of a cheap soap opera); and some horrendously mawkish sentimentality, which frankly made me want to vomit.I found the principal villain to lack depth of character. I don't believe it was the fault of the actor, having seen him in other things, rather the character's motivations were largely ignored by the script and direction. There is a moment between Rocket and the Evolutionary which could have acted as a trigger of a personality change, for example, but the Evolutionary seemed just as depraved and heartless before as after. Actually, this is a common complaint I have with villains in general - if they're unremittingly cruel and horrible to everyone, why does anyone follow them?Having laid out what I didn't like, there were some things which worked. I personally had no expectations of newer characters like the Space Dog or Adam Warlock (these are things which seem to preoccupy comic fanboys on the whole), but they were entertaining additions to the canon. The Guardian who amused me most consistently was Drax (he certainly did a lot less angry shouting than the others), and Groot was reliably entertaining. You might be forgiven for thinking that I am a person who lacks emotional depth, whereas in fact I found a lot to applaud in the way Rocket's back story was handled, but for me it got unnecessarily over-sentimental at times, and it would have been much more effective if that particular instinct had been reigned in.On a final note, I think the 2.5h run time was in danger of outstaying its welcome, which I would never say of a film I thoroughly enjoyed. A slightly trimmer and more tightly scripted and story-boarded film would probably have served the franchise better.", "rating": 6, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 3}, "heading": "MCU equivalent of a bag of Revels", "date": "2023-05-18T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9062503", "sentiment score": [0.0351, 0.6137, 0.3159, 0.0337, 0.0016]}, {"content": "Okay, here we have the newest installment to the Marvel franchise and the official title is \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\". I guess I will just talk a bit about the basics here and then move on in brainstorming fashion to some of the aspect of the plot of this movie. With the Avengers films over, of course we are getting closer to the end of the entire franchise, but a few more films are surely going to happen. This one here could be the one that is going to end the Guardians of the Galaxy sub-franchise then and it felt a bit strange to finally have a movie from the Avengers universe that does not have Dr. Strange in it. He has been everywhere literally before that. But yeah, this one runs for almost exactly 2.5 hours and this is the expected running time for a film like this I would say and overall I would also not have kept it much shorter. The scenes made sense. The one who wrote all those and is also once again the director is of course James Gunn. He has been part of the GotG films since the very beginning in both positions, so no surprise he is back here as well. I mean there was even a short holiday special last year I think and Gunn was on board there too, so no way he would miss out here. I am still curious about what he is going to work on when/if the GotG films really have their closure. Now? As for the cast, you will be getting all the familiar faces and voices again from the previous movies. I will not mention all the names now, but the one leading the gang is of course once more Chris Pratt's character and Pom Klementieff is also growing on me more and more. Interesting actress and with her I am also curious what she is going to work on next. Really nice to get a relatively unknown actress for such a key role, even if she had not been in it from the start. I also loved her little Fantasy Football endeavor song in-between.But yeah the guys are all really big names and the one of them with the most awards attention in the past is probably Bradley Cooper with all his Oscar nominations. Him we do not see here, but he is the one giving his voice to the racoon that does not want to be a racoon or actually he finally accepted his identity at the end of the movie here. Maybe not as much of an emotional and kickass movie as they wanted it to be, but it was alright. I love racoons anyway, so I am a bit biased here. This movie is a lot about this racoon character now, which made me especially curious to watch it as I knew beforehand, even if said racoon is mostly unconscious for the vast majority of the film and his buddies are trying everything they can to cure him and thus have to take a deep dive into the little creature's past. He is also called squirrel on one occasion, but not by one of the good guys. Anyway, the raccoon('s) story is so much at the center of it all that Pratt hardly felt like a lead character anymore. But that is okay. I am not a big fan of him either and always found him on the overexposed side. I mean good for him he managed such a big career coming from the (comedy) small screen initially, but yeah, not a fan here. Also not too much of Cooper by the way. Pratt/Quill then still gets a few big moments like when he is not ready to let the coon depart or when he almost dies towards the end then, but is saved by a new face of the franchise. It was alright. I still wondered how Quill recovered so quickly from this. Said new face is played by Will Poulter (always great recognition value, even if you cannot come up with the name immediately) who seemed like the main antagonist early on with his pretty quick showing in this movie as he attacks our heroes, but turns out he is just an aide of the real villain. And as you may have guessed at some point when he started treating this pet (in a way he is one himself) in a nice and caring fashion, he gets his second chance from the Guardians (I always keep writing Avengers almost, but oh well they are part of those too I assume) and even becomes one of them in the end and finds real friends. What happened with this female character there by the way who also belonged to the bad guys, was his instructor or mother or whatever?It is once again the bad guys where the film gets in new faces that have not been part of the franchise before. The lead antagonist is played by Chukwudi Iwuji. Big role for him and just like the main antagonist for the probably next Thor movie, this actor also proved himself worthy of a major big-screen role through his turns on the small screen. There is not much more to say to him. A touch of God complex and we have seen that in Thanos of course already. Overall, he is not the most memorable antagonist. What stays maybe most in the mind about him is the scene in which he loses his mask and we see what the young Rocket did to him back in the day. Bloody mess. The scene in which he blows up his revolting squad stayed memorable too. Honestly, for a little while here and there I felt as if I was watching Samuel L. Jackson. Where has he gone by the way? Anyway, what really makes you think at the end then that the GotG films may be over is the fact that two key characters decide to leave. Or actually three if you count Zoe Saldana's character among them already too. I mean she is not the Gamora she once was, but yeah in the end she returns to her bunch of criminals that also include Sylvester Stallone's character, even if he is seen only briefly. Quill and Mantis are the other two leaving and I find it almost sadder in terms of the latter, but who knows they might be back. Mantis' leaving also means at least a temporary delay to her potential love story with Dave Bautista's Drax. Pity. I like both characters. With Bautista I am also curious how he will keep going after this franchise. I mean if you look at all the stuff (Avengers, Bond, Blade Runner) he has been in by now, you can even say he has made it bigger than The Rock. At least if we look at the now. Should be interesting to see how this turns out. In any case, there is still a lot of work to be done and we see it a bit in the closing credits when Rocket Raccoon, the new leader, takes care of some alien creatures there. Two post-credit sequences may be one too many, however.What else? I liked how some characters had their special moments here where they once more could show us their talents. With Mantis it was how she makes some villains useless early on, but especially the scene in which she tames these creepy creatures that in the end even join her on her journey. How about a film about her future maybe at some point? I would love such a spin-off. And with Bautista's Drax, he is the one who makes sure all the children are safe when the two females are just arguing. That was also kinda nice and used to show us that he is not a likable fool or idiot, but much more than that. I indeed felt until that point that he was just brought in for some funny lines before that like the talking about who Quill's best and second-best friend is and way more than that, which was still so much funnier than Quill's allegedly funny lines when he asks if something was cool or also the usually failed humor from Tony Stark in this universe. So yeah, Drax may actually be my favorite funny character from the Avengers universe thinking of it. Nice delivery there from Bautista and good writing of course too. His moments make the film (or these films in fact) a lot lighter and will bring a smile to your lips here and there. Just some more brainstorming now: What is up with Sarah Alami in here and her character or the character's name? It was not even a S. Alami joke, was it? Man I would love to be named like this. I realize some former Moroccan tennis player came pretty close. Never thought of that. Oscar nominee Maria Bakalova is also in this film and I am not so sure if I really like her character too much, but it is a cute dog, so she can get away with it. But the \"bad dog\" joke they went with for a little too long maybe. The scene when she and her owner take care of some of the bad guys with their telepathic abilities was still cool. Said owner was played by Sean Gunn if I see it correctly, so this was indeed a bit of a family affair as he is of course the brother of the man who is the driving force behind this project. I think during the film itself the late Stan Lee was also credited as a writer or at least credited some way, but on imdb Gunn is the only writing credit. Oh well, nobody will forget about Lee anyway.There's surely more scenes and inclusion I can talk about here, like how I am still a bit surprised that Nebula is played by a White actress, that Nebula was also really close with Rocket looking at how she reacted when she found out he is alive or in general the scene when he almost dies. That was touching how there he sees his friends from his childhood, the other deformed animals and it was nice to see they were doing fine and also that they did not kill him off. I definitely want a Guardians movie with Rocket leading the gang. Or at least another 40-minute special. Make it happen! Other than that, it was once again maybe not too realistic how all the heroes survived this movie despite occasionally hopeless situations and the antagonist, if we look at his powers when he is presented to us as some kind of god almost, was also defeated a bit too easily for my liking. Quite the team effort though. That is almost all then as the character limit is close. That gigantic pig creature from the bad guys was interesting, but sadly dead too quickly. I also felt sorry for the spy or what it was and how he is bullied on one occasion and killed not much later. Nathan Fillion played the bully there. That actor also has great recognition value always. That is really it now, the newest Guardians of the Galaxy movies is a good watch, but not a great one. You get exactly what you came for here. Plus some drop-dead gorgeous baby raccoons already in the first shot.

And the film itself feels like a reduced copy of what's gone before.The formula from the first two films is there, and writer/director James Gunn's style and approach is evident at various points throughout, with some funny moments and quite a funky soundtrack. Yet somehow, it also all feels like a more heavy and solemn affair, without the carefree spark and joy of the first two. The story feels a little piecemeal, and at an indulgent two and a half hours, it can feel like a bit of a strain. The usual gang, including Pratt, Cooper and Dave Bautista as Drax, have developed their own chemistry over time which rolls on here, however, Iwuji is overly hammy and theatrical as the villain (in spite of Starlord's humorous observation of his resemblance to Robocop), whilst Will Pointer's role seems kind of pointless.This is what average Guardians looks like, I guess.

What I'm about to say might seem a little naive, but I hate how they ended ALSO Quill and Gamora's love story.Starting with the fact that of all the couples in the MCU, theirs was my favorite, I point out that the ending of the movie, where Quill stops chasing the \"new\" Gamora, was maybe the only reasonable one. For her to fall in love with him again would have been ridiculous, to say the least. However, I kept hoping that their story would continue, because their saga, the Guardians of the Galaxy saga, has always been, for lack of a more specific term, the craziest. But most of all, what pissed me off was the fact that their story is just the latest in the list. So far, the only couple in the MCU that has actually ended well is Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter. In all the others, either one of them dies (TS&PP, WM&V, NR&BB, T&JF) or, as in the case of Peter and MJ, he decides to let her go. I don't know why exactly. Maybe not to play with the happily ever after, or maybe because movie sagas are now like drama TV series, where no couple can end fine unless the actors stay together until the end of the series. Zoe Saldana stated that while she hopes the producers can find an actress to take over the role of Gamora, she made it clear that this is her last movie in the MCU. Basically, I resent the fact that Quill and Gamora could not end their story on a positive note. It may be a little childish, but for me, that's one of the main reasons I didn't walk out of the theater thinking, \"Wow, I've never seen a more perfect saga ending!\". I admit I have no idea how James Gunn could have saved their story, but after more than 30 movies with basically the same scenario, the ending that cannot be positive about a relationship is now the real clich\u00e9 ending, for me.So while I still regard this as the first good movie, along with Spiderman No Way Home, after Avengers Endgame, I still note that the drama put on it ruined a little a saga that shined also for his lighter tone, with lots of fun and not too much tragedy.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "A great finale, but with an ending I didn't appreciate much.", "date": "2023-05-17T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9059994", "sentiment score": [0.0025, 0.011, 0.0684, 0.6908, 0.2272]}, {"content": "The MCU lately has definitely had its ups and downs.

To me the biggest issue is them trying to force in too much which causes a lot of character issues as well as rushed plots and resolutions. Even the films that and shows that said were great were brought down a notch because of those issues. But here we have Guardians 3, made by James Gunn who is one the only filmmakers that Kevin Feige and the rest of the studio for the most part can't influence and that is why This film is above everything released since Endgame.This film is the perfect conclusion to the trilogy, it raps up storylines for each character all while delivering an emotional roller coaster packed with comedy, action, and all around great storytelling.The performances are some of the absolute best in the MCU including Chris Pratt who definitely stepped it up for this film. The Villain played by Chukwudi Iwuji is top notch and I would consider him to be the best in the trilogy.This to me is the best film in the trilogy and I hold Guardians 1 very highly. But this film elevates in every way and makes for one of the best films in the franchise.My only gripe is one that I am guessing may not have been James Gunns choice. Adam Warlock was bad, I mean really bad. He was used for nothing but comedy and most of it wasn't that good. He didn't have any real impact except for at the beginning and he didn't have an impact again until a certain spot towards the end but other then that he felt very much like a characters that did not need to be there.But overall this is an excellent film and I hope that one day we will at least see these characters return in another film.A.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 5, "votes": 7}, "heading": "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 review", "date": "2023-05-16T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9059894", "sentiment score": [0.0044, 0.0296, 0.1876, 0.6933, 0.0851]}, {"content": "I am 100% aware there were no real animals in this film, but the torture and killings of the animals in the flashbacks were too much.

With its infectious blend of humor, heart, and cosmic action, this film proves to be a worthy addition to the Guardians' legacy, delivering a satisfying farewell to our favorite ragtag team of misfits.The story picks up after the events of Vol. 2, diving deeper into the origins and personal journeys of our beloved Guardians. From the very beginning, the film strikes a delicate balance between lighthearted comedy and poignant character development. The witty banter and offbeat humor that defined the previous installments remain intact, keeping the audience thoroughly entertained throughout the entire runtime.Chris Pratt returns as the charismatic Star-Lord, leading the team with his irresistible charm and quick wit. Zoe Saldana as Gamora, Dave Bautista as Drax, Karen Gillan as Nebula, and Bradley Cooper as the voice of Rocket Raccoon all give standout performances, effortlessly capturing the essence of their characters and showcasing their growth since their first adventure.One of the film's biggest strengths lies in its exploration of familial bonds and the power of redemption. The complex dynamics between characters, particularly the relationship between Star-Lord and his father, Ego (played brilliantly by Kurt Russell), provide an emotional core that adds depth to the intergalactic spectacle.The visual effects are nothing short of breathtaking. From the vibrant and imaginative alien landscapes to the thrilling space battles, every frame is a testament to the creativity and technical prowess of the filmmaking team. The seamless integration of practical effects and CGI creates a truly immersive experience, making each action sequence a visual feast.James Gunn's direction is masterful, effortlessly blending the film's various elements into a cohesive and satisfying whole. The Guardians' trademark soundtrack, featuring a fantastic selection of '70s and '80s hits, perfectly complements the exhilarating action and injects an additional layer of nostalgia into the narrative.Without giving away any spoilers, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 delivers a conclusion that is both emotionally resonant and filled with surprises. It ties up loose ends while also leaving room for future possibilities, a testament to the care and attention given to the characters and their journeys.In conclusion, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a stellar and fitting finale to the beloved franchise. It strikes the perfect balance between heartwarming character moments, side-splitting humor, and dazzling intergalactic action.

Ergo, he delves in to truly DARK subject matter & consequently, his progression allows him to intimately explore more meaningful themes of identity & morality, challenging every member of the team personally (seriously, the stakes have never been so personal) until they reach the crux of their destined emotional journeys (satisfyingly paying off established arcs, a decade in the making) - & using the lessons learned to artistically reflect ourselves back at us (the viewers), purposefully reaffirming how humanity is ultimately flawed, doomed to chase an abstract concept which is never achievable; perfection - refuting that endeavour (despite the acknowledgement many shall never relinquish the fruitless pursuit) & authentically embracing its bizarre quirks (shining like much needed bright lights against the grim bleakness) in one of the best & most macabre dystopian works of fiction I've seen put to the screen in ages.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 5, "votes": 7}, "heading": "Poignant.", "date": "2023-05-16T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9058735", "sentiment score": [0.063, 0.2667, 0.2916, 0.3023, 0.0764]}, {"content": "My Review- Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)\nMy Rating 7.5 /10I'll admit Cartoon Super heroes are really not my specialty and a little out of my comfort zone however I was entertained and enjoyed the escapades of Star Lord Peter Quill played by Chris Pratt as well as my favourite character Rocky Racoon sorry Rocket Racoon voice supplied by Bradley Cooper ,Drax the warrior played by Dave Bautista ,Nebula the adopted sister of Gamora played by Karen Gillan and my 2nd favourite character Groot a member of the Guardians who is a tree-like humanoid and the accomplice of Rocket .I mean it as a compliment that Groot Played by Vin Diesel gave a very wooden performance in a role that gave him plenty of opportunity to branch out .I enjoyed the light comedy touches in Galaxy 3 and the chemistry that the comrades in arms had together it gives the story a human touch .Although saying that the humans or humanoids are few and far between ,especially on Counter Earth a planet created by the villain of the movie titled The High Evolutionary a scientist played by Chukwudi Iwuji . This Classic mad scientist has populated Counter Earth with his created anthropomorphic animal creatures that mimic the everyday lives of our planet Earth which has destroyed itself with corruption and War.The movie opens on a planet or place called Nowhere which reminded me very much of the seedy Cantina bar scene in Star Wars where we're introduced to characters just as strange and just as seedy.The action begins with an attack from a warrior Adam Warlock who critically wounds Rocket which sets the action when the Guardians are unable to tend to Rockets wounds prompting Peter Quill to sets off find the combination of the kill switch embedded in the beloved raccoons head to save his life .It's a fun and exciting romp of a movie reminding me of the Saturday matinee movies I grew up watching .Whether it's Our Gang, The Three Musketeers, Harry Potter and his Gryffindors or The Magnificent Seven buddy movies have audience appeal so I suspect this is the case with The Guardians.Where todays Saturday matinee movies differ of course is due to the technology as they are certainly more spectacular of course .They are far more innovative as they would be with a Production budget that any treasurer would be envious of .\"Guardians of the Galaxy 3\" cost $250 million to produce and roughly $100 million to promote fortunately for Disney its a huge box office hit already with a $528.8 million in global sales in its second weekend in theatres.There's fortunes to be made for all in The Guardians of the Galaxy movie franchise including it's star Chris Pratt . His father in law Arnold Schwarzenegger put his full support behind his son in law and was very proud of the result.Chris Pratt's estimated net worth to date is $80 million not bad since his first Galaxy movie was filmed only nine years ago.I imagine Disney were pleased to welcome Director and screenwriter James Gunn back to the fold after his dismissal in 2018 his contribution is obviously crucial to the box office success of Guardians of the Galaxy.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 5, "votes": 7}, "heading": "Spectacular Saturday Matinee buddy movie", "date": "2023-05-16T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9058715", "sentiment score": [0.0095, 0.0447, 0.3115, 0.5921, 0.0422]}, {"content": "What an amazing movie this was.

{"content": "I went into this film with really low expectations since the last couple of movies films have been more than forgettable but this movie was something incredibly different, James Gunn was able to make a great ending for such an amazing set of characters by expanding on everything we thought we knew about them the main example would be rocket raccoon (which once again was played brilliantly by Bradley Cooper) and how the plot and the villain revolve mostly of his back story which was an incredible story to show how he became who he is all while making the audience tear up.Chukwudi Iwuji did an incredible job of selling the threat the high evolutionary was and frankly, I found it refreshing that Marvel is doing villains who are just pure evil where I feel like in the past couple of movies they have made they have tried to make you feel empathetic for the villain wherever it's the villain trying to reconnect with their family (Doctor Strange: Multiverse of Madness) or whether they are avenging their family (Thor: Love and Thunder) so it is nice to see a villain who you can see as just pure evil and completely deranged.Once again every member of the guardians were played so well by each actor with some old side characters such as nebula taking centre stage this time which I thought was really enjoyable and nice to see such a good character being put into the spotlight and the same with kraglin who in the past was just a background character behind yondu but now hes a full fledged character trying to prove to the team he can be useful like yondu was and the new character introduced being adam warlock (whos played by the comedic genius will poulter) was a fun and charming character my only problem with him and really the whole film is that hes called this top of the evolution chain superhuman but really throughout the film he does not do much hes just there and the only relevance he plays to the plot being at the start after that he just pops up every 20 or minutes (side note: I personally wasn't the happiest with how they used him overall as in the original comics hes this powerhouse who was used to take down thanos so to reduce him to just some little side character who doesn't show off too much power just feels like a injustice to a very important character in the marvel universe but is coming more from a comic fan then a movie critic).Any film following a team that's directed by james gunn whether they are a group of renegade heros trying to protect the cosmos, a team of criminals sent out to be toys for the government to earn their freedom or a team of young mystery solvers, he always knows how to capture that team and/or family feeling with the bond between them all whether it's the serious moments where lives are on the line or just sitting around having a banter james knows exactly what to have them say and do to make to make them feel like they are all a real family and the same works with how he makes the films this film was such a bright and fun bit of entertainment for all the family to enjoy which knows when its time to be dumb and silly and when to be serious and it all works so well with eachother where like more recent marvel movies you could have a serious and tense scene but then all that serious feeling be taken away by a badly timed joke which hasn't landed well but that's not what happens here all the jokes and funny moment stay to their own parts to not ruin the impact the seriousness some of the moments in the film had.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 2},

We dont need to be spoon-fed the fact that rocket is in danger, we couldve completely understood that without it. Its pretty obvious that it is just a useless plot tool so the the writers can be lazy and have characters get into fights with no consequence on their health to be able to do another one right after. If youre going to write a story where you dont have time to include any injuries or deaths, then just dont let them get hurt in the first place??Secondly, since the main villain had these incredible powers capable of stopping all his guards who were pointing guns at him ready to shoot.

It seemed like he wasnt using the full potential of his power because the movie was already too long and the lazy predictable plot just HAD to have all the heroes beat him right? This is not the only time the plot has problems with lazily crunching important moments into a smaller timeframe; it can also be observed in the last few scenes where Quill is about to die then is saved in seconds and is COMPLETELY UNHARMED 1 MINUTE LATER! This could have been a sad death scene to naturally end an era, but no, they just had to add this for no reason just for him to end up leaving for earth anyways with his happy ending hero story because thats what always happens!!Finally, the villain is so one-sided, predictable, flat, and provokes no thought or moral conflict in the viewers minds at all whatsoever. It does not challenge your point of view on anything at all. Heroes good villain bad, hurt animal bad, hero always win. Marvel should know we are not little kids judging by the fact that they put in the F bomb and very disturbing scenes of animal cruelty. So, if marvel knows we can be adult enough for that, why are we not adult enough for a story that actually breaks the mold and makes the audience think?In conclusion, yes this movie was good for PHASE 4 (the worst phase ever!!) That does not mean it deserves to be called the best MCU movie by a lot of people. I really think people are overhyping it because they have been so deprived of above horrible content for so long that they think this is somehow a \"masterpiece\" in any way. They introduce new concepts as a lazy fix for their plot holes, make the villain not show his full power just for the point that the hero must always win even if it shouldnt be that easy, and show problems in the world (animal cruelty) without provoking any thought or change in perspective about it into the minds of the viewers at all. People need to take a step back from the hype and realize that hidden behind the tear-jerker backstory of Rocket is a movie that is objectively JUST AVERAGE...thank you for your time.", "rating": 5, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 12}, "heading": "I dont understand why everybody else likes it so much", "date": "2023-05-15T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9057795", "sentiment score": [0.3581, 0.4202, 0.1265, 0.0656, 0.0296]}, {"content": "Sat through about 3 hours of a movie that was so Disconnected to anything previous in this gern.

So far this has been the best MCU movie out of anything that has come out since Endgame.Thor: Love and Thunder and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania have been such disappointments that they left a bad taste in my mouth and this movie washed that away fortunately. That's not to say it made me regain my trust in the future of MCU and the new movies, not at all! This movie working and having an actual competent script and narrative is all because of James Gunn.You can always rely on Gunn to deliver a movie that has a decent plot, actual character growth and arcs, and actual character depth. He's a master at balancing the comedy and the serious emotional parts, though he may sometimes overdo the comedy, not one comedy bit in this movie was cringy or unfunny.He didn't turn his protagonists into complete buffoons so he could get a laugh out of the audience and fail miserably at it like Love and Thunder. If the characters like Drax and Mantis are mostly comic relief, it's ok in this case since it's their characterization. They were always like this. He didn't turn a serious mythic god into a clown. He didn't ruin the emotional and heartfelt scenes with one-liners and cringey quips.He knows how to make his movies fun and not make them take themselves too seriously, but make them be serious enough to give you actual characters you care for and an engaging and competent story.The pacing in this movie is pretty decent and even though you might sometimes feel the runtime in the middle, personally I don't think any scene from this was unnecessary and could've been cut. Some could argue they could've cut down on the comedy scenes, but I didn't find them annoying at all and they weren't persistent or long enough to ruin a scene or the pacing. From the beginning we jump quickly into action and the story begins, and the movie jumps between the present and flashbacks for quite a while throughout the whole movie.And even though I'm usually not a big fan of excessive amounts of flashbacks in movies to tell a story, I think this was much needed and made the movie better. Since the Guardians themselves don't meet the antagonist until halfway through, the flashbacks do a good job of introducing him to us without someone just expositing the backstory and the villain.Through the flashbacks, Gunn does a great job of giving more depth to Rocket Raccoon and making you care about him more than you already do. It is just beautifully done.For character development and arcs, I actually expected to see more from Gamora and Quill's relationship and how Gamora changes throughout the movie. And she does change a little, but I guess I expected more focus on their relationship than what we got. But I liked what they did with Gamora and Peter at the end and gave a pretty refreshing conclusion to them.As always it is with Gunn's movies, we can see that he actually likes and cares about his characters. That's why even Drax who's been the clown of the group and the bottom of the joke also gets a beautiful (semi) arc too and he's given more depth too.Mantis gets decent character development too and all of the members of the Guardians get their own ending and all of them fit their characters.Even Kraglin has somewhat of a character arc in the movie.I think Peter Quill probably gets the best and most emotional ending out of all of them.I do feel like though, that Groot didn't get much screen time and character depth as much as every other member of the group. It would've been nice if we got to see how Rocket and Groot first met or even some backstory for Groot alone, but the movie would've probably been 3 plus hours.I also think Nebula became my favorite in this movie.As for Adam Warlock, I think he was a nice addition to the movie, but he wasn't fully developed (literally). He's mostly a plot device. But it is nice to have him here and not let the post-credit scene of the last movie be for nothing and a loose end. Some would say he should've been already introduced in IW and Endgame, but I disagree. Those movies were already packed as they were, I don't think Adam Warlock would've gotten any more characterization than what he got here. He would've gotten the same treatment as Captain Marvel in Endgame. He does have a direct link to the villain of this movie and the golden people of the last one, so it makes sense for him to be in the last movie of the trilogy, though I expected more focus on him. Nevertheless, he is still a decent character with his own little character arc too. Seems like Gunn stole all the character arc ink from the writers' rooms of Love and Thunder and Quantumania and gave each and every one of his characters some amount of depth and arc and left those movies to have nothing. Though Adam is the least developed.There are also actual stakes in this movie and you care about all these characters and you can feel that any of them could die at any time, something that hasn't been felt in Marvel movies for a long time now. Now it's true that most of it is thanks to the previous movies characterizing these characters and making us care about them, it's a trilogy anyway, but this movie does a great job of making us care again after a long time of not having seen them, at least under Gunn's direction and writing.High Evolutionary is an interesting villain that might not be as memorable as some other MCU villains, but I think he's a pretty good villain with tangible motives and one of the most irredeemable villains. They actually do a good job of giving his character more depth through the flashbacks with Rocket and not have a disposable villain that is not even present till the final act and you don't know or care about his motives. His motives might be somewhat similar to Thanos, but I think it's somewhat original enough to not say it's the same thing over and over and we've seen it before. Although I do think that they kinda don't even explain what his actual powers are or show much of it at all. So I guess my only nitpick with his characterization is that. And even though he does a lot of expositions about his motives, they don't sound too expository and the dialogue feels natural too. And not all things about him are outright said through exposition, the audience themselves can pretty much guess why he does what he does at the end.The dialogue in general is pretty good honestly and James Gunn has proven himself several times in the past that he's a pretty competent writer and his movies and show have decent non-cringey dialogue.The plot itself isn't that complex or even perfect, but it is pretty good, and compared to whatever the scripts of Thor 4 and Ant-Man 3 were, it is a masterpiece.As for this movie being the last in the trilogy, I think it does an amazing job of wrapping up every character's story and giving them new journies to partake in. It is an extremely emotional ending to the trilogy and despite there being a lot of fake-outs, at least personally for me, they didn't feel like cheating at all (except for the last one) and didn't feel like the movie is artificially trying to make you sad and emotionally manipulate you. (Which well duh, that's the whole point of a movie). This is probably the most complete and best trilogy in the MCU next to Captain America's. Although you do actually need to watch Infinity War, Endgame, and the Holiday Special or you will definitely miss a lot of character developments and events, it is still a pretty solid trilogy that you can watch without having the need to watch 2 morbillion movies before it.And I don't think I even need to talk about the music. You know that James Gunn always delivers with the music. Even though there are a lot of licensed songs in this movie, he doesn't play them every five minutes and it's not a music video compilation of the worst pop songs you've ever heard like David Ayer's Suicide Squad where you wanted to shoot yourself to make it stop. His taste in music is great and all of the songs he chooses match the feel and the tone of the scene. Though it can be sometimes jarring to hear a song immediately be played after a serious moment so we can transition to the next scene. But overall, I think the music in this movie is brilliant, and John Murphy does a great job with his original soundtrack for the movie. The movie's soundtrack is not all licensed rock and pop songs, it actually has a lot of great themes that won't be missed while watching and elevate the scenes really neatly. The movie actually had really good original music pieces that I will be definitely getting and listening to multiple times.The movie is an amazing end to these characters' journey, it has a pretty decent and engaging plot, the script is really good with decent dialogue and great character arcs and developments, Rocket Raccoon gets a great backstory and character depth, the villain is not one-dimensional and has pretty good motivations, it acts as a great final movie in a trilogy and completes pretty much all the characters their journies they had since they first met and is a breath of fresh air after dozens of disappointing and outright unwatchable Disney Plus shows and MCU movies.It is sad that this is James Gunn's last movie in this universe, but at the same time, I'm happy that he actually got to finish his vision for these characters and complete his trilogy, and got to be at the helm of DC which I'm sure the movies are gonna be great under his helm.Thank you James, very cool!", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Looks Like Kino Is Back on the Menu Boys!", "date": "2023-05-15T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9057429", "sentiment score": [0.1032, 0.1773, 0.1681, 0.2924, 0.2591]}, {"content": "This is a good swan song to the original crew of Guardians.

Basically, the Guardians of the Galaxy: Peter Quill aka Star-Lord (Chris Pratt), Drax (Dave Bautista), Nebula (Karen Gillan), Mantis (Pom Klementieff), Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and Groot (Vin Diesel) have established their new headquarters on the rebuilt Knowhere. During the night, they are attacked by Adam Warlock (Will Poulter), a Sovereign warrior created by their high priestess Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki). Rocket is critically wounded during the attack; Adam overpowers them but is forced to flee after being stabbed by Nebula. The Guardians are unable to heal Rocket's wounds due to a kill switch, implanted into him by the company Orgocorp. They travel to Orgocorp's headquarters to find the override code. While Rocket is unconscious, he recalls his past, shown in flashbacks. As a baby raccoon, he was experimented on by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji), a scientist who sought to enhance and anthropomorphise animal lifeforms to create a Counter-Earth. Rocket formed friendships with the High Evolutionary's other test subjects: the otter Lylla (Linda Cardellini), the walrus Teefs (Asim Chaudhry), and the rabbit Floor (Mikaela Hoover). The High Evolutionary was impressed by Rocket's developing intellect but became furious once it had exceeded his own. Rocket helped tThe High Evolutionary to perfect his experiments but ordered Rocket's brain to be extracted and his friends incinerated. Rocket freed Lylla, only for the High Evolutionary to kill her. Rocket mauled the High Evolutionary and shot his guards, but Teefs and Floor were killed in the crossfire. Alone, Rocket stole a spaceship and escaped. In the present, the alternate version of Gamora (Zoe Saldana), who has joined the Ravagers, helps the Guardians infiltrate Orgocorp. They retrieve Rocket's file but discover that the code has been removed. The group speculates that Theel (Nico Santos), one of the High Evolutionary's advisors, has it, so they depart for Counter-Earth. They are followed by Ayesha and Adam, who are ordered by their creator, the High Evolutionary, to retrieve Rocket for his brain. Upon arriving, they are greeted by an array of anthropomorphic animal residents, they are initially startled by them but help the team to find Theel and the High Evolutionary's ship. Drax and Mantis stay with Gamora and Rocket while Peter Quill, Groot, and Nebula travel to the High Evolutionary's ship. Nebula is forced to wait outside by guards as Quill and Groot board. Drax and Mantis pursue Quill's group. The High Evolutionary initiates his destruction and planned recreation of Counter-Earth, which kills all life on the planet, including Ayesha. As his ship enters orbit, Quill and Groot leap off and kill Theel, retrieving the code from him. Gamora arrives with their ship to rescue them, while Nebula, Mantis, and Drax board the High Evolutionary's ship to escape the planet. As Quill's group attempts to use the code, Rocket flatlines and has a near-death experience, where he reunites with Lylla, Teefs, and Floor in the afterlife. Lylla tells him that it is not his time yet as Quill uses the code to disable the kill switch and save Rocket's life. Nebula, Mantis, and Drax come across hundreds of imprisoned humanoid children on the High Evolutionary's ship before being captured. Quill's group sets out to rescue the trio, who are placed in a chamber with monstrous Abilisks. Mantis befriends the Abilisks, allowing the group to escape and reunite with Quill's group, together overpowering the High Evolutionary's army. Kraglin (Sean Gunn, James's brother) and Cosmo (Maria Bakalova) arrive on Knowhere, and the captured children are freed through a telekinetic tunnel created by Cosmo connecting the High Evolutionary's ship to the planet. Rocket discovers imprisoned animals on the ship before being attacked by the High Evolutionary. But the rest of the Guardians arrive to help defeat him, leaving him to perish on his ship. The animals are released by the Guardians and lead them aboard Knowhere. Quill nearly dies trying to cross over but is saved by Adam, who had a change of heart after being saved by Groot. In the aftermath, Quill leaves the Guardians, passing the roll of captain onto Rocket before leaving for Earth to reunite with his grandfather Jason (Gregg Henry). Mantis embarks on a journey of self-discovery with the Abilisks, Gamora reunites with the Ravagers, and Nebula and Drax remain on Knowhere to raise the rescued children. The new Guardians, consisting of Rocket, Groot, Cosmo, Kraglin, Adam, rescued child Phyla (Kai Zen), and Adam's pet Blurp (Dee Bradley Baker), take on a new mission. Also starring Nathan Fillion as Master Karja, Sylvester Stallone as Stakar Ogord, Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex, Christopher Fairbank as the Broker, Karen Abercrombie as Grandma Quill, Michael Rooker as Yondu Udonta, Judy Greer as the voice of War Pig, and Tara Strong as the voice of Mainframe. Pratt, Bautista, Gillan and the rest of the gang all get their moments, Cooper obviously stands out with the his origins story, Cardellini makes an impression as a kind-hearted talking otter, Iwuji is reasonable as the obsessive villain, and Poulter and Debicki are alright as well. The movie is the usual mix of heroes and villains battling each other, high-speed fights and chases, brilliant special effects and CGI, and amusing moments, but it also has it darker, melancholic moments as Rocket becomes the central character and it has his backstory being experimented on along with other animals, this is most interesting. As before the soundtrack of \"awesome\" songs adds to the fun (including \"Creep\" by Radiohead, \"Since You Been Gone\" by Rainbow, \"No Sleep Till Brooklyn\" by Beastie Boys, and \"Dog Days Are Over\" by Florence + the Machine), it looks like this is indeed the conclusion to this trilogy, but the characters can always come back elsewhere in the Marvel series, this is a terrific superhero science-fiction action adventure.

It's not different with director James Gunn finalizing his time with Marvel/Disney. A lot of you enjoyment may have to come with whether or not you like Gunn's mix tape here. It is decidedly a flick that requires you enjoy needle drop music. To me, it gets tedious. Somewhat like a teenager attempting to show you the new music he found. You must have the patience for these moments.Tens years of GOTG and it ends with an origin story of Rocket. The core of the story is that he is an elevated experimented upon animal that is the goal of The High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). A part android (I think) who is desperate to create the perfect society where it has no violence or ugliness. While the idea of it is great, the execution of his plan is ugly. And he is not afraid to sacrifice. He is much like a bully who has toys and abuses him to his whim. Though he is brilliant beyond words, he also lacks empathy. And to the stories credit, he understands he is much like the monstrosities he creates. The experimented upon animals are also somewhat elevated. Though painfully slapped together clumsily, they are the land of misfits who become friends at the lab.Meanwhile, Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) and the Guardians Mantis, Drax, and Nebula, need to save Rocket. The High Evolutionary put a failsafe in Rocket that could destruct in him. They need to operate to take it out.There is a lot of fun to be had here. Typical James Gunn silliness in their banter is peppered throughout the movie. It's refreshing that he is taking a more mature approach. Unlike \"The Suicide Squad\" which decidedly was crass and dumb. This gave us a softer landing when it comes to the self-awareness comedy that prevails in his flicks. This comedy stems from his years at Troma. Obvious in shoehorning all the lively jokes. It is to the credit of all of his talent that they make it work.I enjoyed this volume a lot.

The first 2/3 of the film is pretty much MacGuffin after MacGuffin as the crew rushes to complete missions in new exotic settings.But the music is punchy, well fitting. The soundtrack has been a part of the GotG DNA since the first movie and it's reassuring that Vol. 3 is no different in this regard.The new characters are magnetic, Will Poulter really shines as Adam Warlock in a way I wasn't quite expecting. I haven't really seen much of Chukwudi Iwuji's work, but he's quite incredible as the High Evolutionary here. Really brings an insanity with the right amount of deranged intensity. Cosmo returns from the holiday special as the wonderful side charcter/guardian. Really really loved the inclusion here, what a wonderful treat for dog-loving audiences.And the visuals. Marvel gets flak, rightfully so, for some of their 3rd act action sequences being an unintelligible blend of weightless polygons rendered on the sweat and tears of hundreds of VFX artists, but GotG Vol 3 really has a masterful balance between complex, overwhelming VFX & still strong cinematography and very coherent action pieces. Fights are often chaotic, but still retain their visual clarity.Lastly, the sequels cliche main stay: exploring the past of a character. Rocket's origin is a heartbreaker no doubt. It's not a new concept, but it is done quite well. We get the set up for who Rocket is, why he's rejected the Raccoon portion of his identify, the loss he's felt, and all at the same time, we get a well developed, fleshed out antagonist in the High Evolutionary. There's meaning to WHY Rocket is so important in the story. Despite being a very sad origin story, they cap it off perfectly with the final action sequence where we see Rocket has been prepping for revenge the entire movie. Gravity boots, his new family coming back to help him, and the wonderful chain combos they pull to take out the High Evolutionary. Generic 3rd act of a Marvel film?

This film has a brilliant Soundtrack.The only problem I have with this film is Adam Warlock. He just seems like a typical Marvel Villain, bland and generic with no real motivations apart from trying to get Rocket and he has no character development. No traits.Drax was the best character. His one liners are so funny in this film, and the Marvel quips were better this time.Rocket,We get to see his backstory. And how he became who he is today. Captured by high Evolutionary. He makes friends with the animals, that seem to be trapped with him. As there not ready to go to the Better world, Earth yet. The problem being Rocket is dying due to Warlock throwing him around. And the Guardians try to get him back, and restore his life. But Rocket is trapped with strange looking Animals that have been made to look weird, by High Evolutionary himself. And until they are ready, they will go to this supposedly Better Earth. In order for the Guardians to restore Rockets life they need a key. Which High Evolutionarys partner has. They need to kill him in order to get the Key. The Animals plead for Rocket not to kill High Evolutionary in a fit of rage, to being trapped. He shoots him, and the animals fade away. This scene is so emotional because we've got to see there interactions with each other, and how they had an impact on Rockets life.Gamora,Gamora is dead to the group. Quinn doesn't know that she's still alive. So when Nebula, Gamoras sister says her name he's like WHATTT?. As they were just about to be killed. Drax loving the fact he's strong and can fight tries to but is held back by the group. They need Gamoras help to find Rocket as well. However she is completely different as to how she was before. She keeps on emphasising the fact she's not the one that loves Quill/Starlord. This is really sad and emotional as we've grown up with these characters and loved them, so to see this change is upsetting for the viewers, as we know Quinn and Gamora loved each other. The planet that Gamoras on is rather strange looking as well, looks like a type of cheese which makes it a bit Cheeesy.The effects were great, had great use of colour and lighting. The cinematography was also really good, lot's of shots from a distance.Before the End,Rocket and the group reunite again, and fight High Evaluationarys men. And try to save these animals that have been held hostage on the space Ship. The fight scenes are well put together, and choreographed really well. The emotional scene where we get to see Rocket and his friends again is really emotional, and he goes to get them. All whilst Nebula, Drax and the Mantis help get the kids out, as the New Earth has fire and all life will be destroyed as the space ship is also falling down. Quinn gets stuck and falls, with the new perfect Earth, as the Villain couldn't accept them for who the animals were. And now that world is dying and Quinn gets frozen.

HOWEVER, I'm very sad to say I did not like it and felt extremely let down...and it's James Gunn and what he did so amazingly well in the first two films that is to blame. I enjoyed the first 2 so much that changing gears so dramatically just did me in. Whatever special sauce that went into the first 2 movies that made me feel so good was so glaringly withheld from Volume 3 that it just left me feeling empty.The first two movies have the perfect balance of laughs, intensity, and music. It never went too far in any one direction. This movie on the contrary is dark...very dark...and it overshadows the feel of the film from beginning to end. After the first 20 minutes I thought, \"Boy I hope the rest of the movie isn't like this.\" - but it was. Oh man was it ever. The tone of this movie is just so overwhelmingly different this time around. Gone is that \"fun\" teamwork feel that we've come to love so much. Gone is the crafty decision to not take the whole thing too seriously.One of the film's biggest ironies is that even though they go to such great lengths diving into Rocket's back story that you actually miss out on enjoying the fun, wise-cracking, kick-ass character from the first 2 films because that persona is completely missing in Volume 3.There are those occasions in film when the director breaks a very crucial, yet unspoken rule about a viewer's emotional bond and affinity with the characters. By choosing to not reunite Peter and Gamora (in what would have been a magical note to end on), I believe many viewers will be left unsatisfied. (And yes it is important sometimes to give the viewer what they want - especially if they have already been on this rollercoaster for so many years now.) Yes, I realize Gamora has no memory of her past but this film teased us with opportunities for a rekindled romance. To not bring them back together to me, was a crime.I'm bummed out for my kids. They loved the first 2 movies and could handle the killing and violence pretty well because many times James Gunn brilliantly made killing bad guys FUNNY. There's no way on earth they could watch this movie. It's got too much sadness, too much torture, too much emotional damage, and it has parts that are just plain gross - like almost horror movie type grossness.And what happened to the great music from the first 2 movies? Volume 3 has a few good songs but it's nowhere near the caliber of the first 2. Not even close.Lastly, this movie is at least 30 minutes too long. I felt like the big ship (or whatever that thing was of the High Evolutionary) was on fire for the last half of the movie. The film felt like it tried to end about 5 times.::sigh:: It's time for me to go back to watching Volumes 1 and 2.

Thank you to James Gunn for creating such a beautiful film.When watching a movie, we sometimes feel as if we are riding an emotional roller coaster. There are moments that make us laugh, and there are also moments that make us cry. However, when the ending of the film we are watching ends well, we feel touched and happy.That is exactly what happened when watching the trilogy of films produced by James Gunn. The films are Guardians of the Galaxy, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. These three films have an interesting storyline, accompanied by exciting action, and also full of humor.The first time I watched the film Guardians of the Galaxy, I was amazed by the unique and different characters. There's Peter Quill, the leader of the Guardians of the Galaxy, Gamora who became his first love, Drax who always makes funny comments, Groot who has the ability to multiply himself, and Rocket who is a very smart raccoon. All of these characters have their own characteristics that make them so interesting to watch.When watching Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, I felt closer to the characters and understood how important the meaning of a family is. The presence of Peter Quill's father, who turned out to be an alien, was the beginning of a climaxing conflict that touched my heart. I was impressed by how James Gunn presented the story of a family in such an emotional yet not exaggerated way.And finally, when watching Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, I felt satisfied with the ending that was so touching. After years of adventuring together, the characters reunite and complete their final mission. The beautiful ending made me touched and satisfied with the end of this extraordinary film trilogy.James Gunn's work in the Guardians of the Galaxy film trilogy is truly worthy of appreciation.

However, after the solid but not spectacular 'The Guardians Of The Galaxy: Holiday Special (2022)' and the general lacklustre nature of the MCU's fourth phase, I certainly had my doubts. Not that I thought this series finale would be bad, per se, just that I had tempered my expectations and didn't expect it to be something truly special.But, boy, was I wrong. I'm glad to say that 'Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)' puts every single one of Marvel's post-'Avengers: Endgame (2019)' efforts, even the good ones (with the possible exception of 'Spider-Man: No Way Home (2021)'), to shame. It positively blows them out of the water and, in fact, it's easily the MCU's best movie since the original 'Guardians Of The Galaxy (2014)'. James Gunn once again proves that character is king, delivering an experience that prioritises emotional growth and interpersonal dynamics over all else. His picture is surprisingly dark from the moment it begins, delving into the traumatic origins of its most interesting character in a number of genuinely upsetting sequences. I'd heard this piece packed an emotional punch and the previous two entries certainly had their tearjerker moments, but my goodness this hit hard. Be sure to bring the tissues because there are a number of moments that may just necessitate their use. It's a truly affecting experience. The excellent characters and their evolving relationships are the bedrock of the affair, which is mature and sincere throughout. Although its tone is relatively downbeat, the series' signature humour is still present. While some of it feels a little out of place, its inclusion is always appreciated. Not only is it often funny, it also signifies that the comedy is a crucial part of the character work; these people can't just turn off their personalities when the going gets tough.Despite its inherent darkness, the feature is still a ton of fun when it needs to be and includes a number of fantastic set-pieces that put a smile on your face. The action is exciting, energetic and expert crafted. There's a one-take sequence in the third act that's absolutely phenomenal, easily one of the - if not the - best action scenes in the entire franchise. The picture also looks great, with vibrant cinematography and a solid mix of practical and visual effects. It never feels like the actors are just standing on a blue/green screen set, even though they clearly often are, and the CGI is actually really convincing, almost like the the effects houses had enough time to properly do their work. Basically, it feels like a real movie, with purposeful shot composition and considered blocking. This really is a miracle given Marvel's reputation for rushing and generally mistreating those doing the legwork in creating their fantasy worlds, which - in combination with some lacklustre cinematography - has resulted in their recent efforts being hampered by some truly awful aesthetics.Another element that enhances Gunn's film is its enthusiastic acting, which is honestly really good across the board. There's no sleepwalking John Krasinski's here, that's for sure. The brilliant writing makes sure that pretty much everyone gets quite a bit to chew on and they all chew it exactly the right amount. Their convincing, often moving work adds believability to each and every moment, no matter how wonderfully outlandish it may. They all strike the perfect balance between humour and heart, reflecting the screenplay's own prowess in that department. This entry is arguably the most sincere in its series. Though the prior entries certainly have genuine heart to them, this one seems to wear it on its sleeve just a little more. Its occasional bluntness doesn't dampen its effect, though, because the piece never feels cheap or manipulative. It seems to honesty believe what it ultimately preaches, building upon the warmth the audience already has towards its key players to deliver a powerful finale that wraps everything up almost perfectly.Although the plotting is a little messy, the flick flows nicely and there's never a dull moment. It's arguably slightly too long, but it makes good use of its runtime and is constantly engaging. The villain is seriously menacing, one of the best antagonists in the MCU not for the complexity of his motivation, but for the vicious single-mindedness of his cruelty. The stakes are arguably the smallest in the series, but that's kind of what makes them the most impactful; for most of the movie, they're entirely personal and focused on the survival of a single character. The narrative goes in somewhat of an unexpected direction, yet remains satisfying throughout by leaning into its unconventional elements and providing a powerful look into events previously only alluded to. It's really compelling overall.In the end, this is an absolutely amazing film. Thanks to its unrivalled character work, effective humour, unflinching darkness, spectacular spectacle, energetic action and impressive aesthetic, it stands head and shoulders above most of the MCU and basically hammers the final nail in the coffin of movies like 'Doctor Strange In The Multiverse Of Madness (2022)' and 'Thor: Love And Thunder (2022)'. This is what happens when you hire a filmmaker and actually let them make the film they want to make. Kevin Feige really should take notes. Emotion and character are the key to good stories; it's a shame Marvel seems to have forgotten that. 'Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023)' is honestly one of the best superhero movies ever made. Given its recent disappointments, I didn't think I'd be saying that about an entry in the MCU anytime soon.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 9, "votes": 17}, "heading": "My beloved raccoon.

It was definitely a more darker approach to the MCU while maintaining a lot of humor in it, and overall Gunn managed to mix the two aspects really well.I will say that if you if you have a soft spot for animals and disturbed by cruelty towards animals (like myself), then you may have a hard time sitting through this movie. The main villain is easily hatable, and similar to Thanos, has a genocide complex (minus the interesting part).Rocket was easily the heart of this movie, and Gunn did an excellent job fleshing put his character. While hard to experience at times, it was sad, dark, and traumatic. This was ended up being the most horrific Marvel movie I have ever seen, and I'm not alone on this stance.The writing was good too. I don't think it was dry like the other more recent Marvel films, so it's really just a breath of fresh air to watch a Marvel movie that makes me care about these characters, and I haven't felt that since Wakanda Forever. The humor is freaky funny at times (especially with Drax), but at others it just fell flat to me (which has to happen at least once in a Marvel movie, but I'm glad the humor wasn't as bad as Love and Thunder). The action was great, and the film has a lot great camera angles that i really appreciate a lot more than most people will.Adam Warlock has always been an interesting character for me. I'm not too familiar with his role in the comics, but I have read a fair amount where he is featured. Warlock just doesn't really have a purpose in the movie, he just causes some chaos, leaves and then 40 minutes later causes more chaos. I get that he was setup from Vol. 2, but he's just so underdeveloped to the point that he probably shouldn't've even been in this movie. I do hope Marvel does more with this character as he definitely didn't serve justice for this movie.While Rocket did steal the show, I felt like every other character in this film was written pretty well. Quill had his moments, and I felt like he was really fleshed out a lot in this film too. The other characters were just as good too, some of them may not be as fleshed out as I hoped them to be, but that's ok as that is made up through their charm.This movie has once again given me hope for the MCU. It was a really emotional movie that had a nice blend of action, darkness, and humor, and you can tell James Gunn really cares about these characters, and I wish him the best of luck for future projects he ends up working on in the future.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 5, "votes": 9}, "heading": "James Gunn Saves the MCU", "date": "2023-05-14T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9054391", "sentiment score": [0.0189, 0.1514, 0.4163, 0.3832, 0.0302]}, {"content": "Thank you, James Gunn, for creating an actual good MCU movie post Spider-Man Far From Home.As much as some jokes were cringe, I can say I managed to handle the weakest jokes.

After a series of underwhelming releases, It was a fresh air of a movie after all the trash that MCU has been given us like LAT, Ant-Man, Wakanda Forever, Eternal, MOM, Black Widow. This film emerges as a refreshing departure, presenting an actual movie experience rather than relying solely on fan service. Most importantly, it was free from cringe-worthy, over-the-top unfunny jokes.From the beginning until the end, with every seconds and every minutes, it was incredible. The film boasts a compelling plot that keeps viewers engaged, thanks in large part to a formidable villain. Additionally, the introduction of Adam Warlock is executed in such a cool way that it become a meme.One of the movie's standout moments comes in the form of an emotionally charged rocket flashback scene. The fact that an MCU film can make such a heartfelt response from audiences is a testament to the exceptional storytelling prowess of director James Gunn. Furthermore, Bradley Cooper's remarkable performance as Rocket deserves special recognition, as he brings depth and authenticity to the character.Each character in the film shines, undergoing significant development that adds layers of complexity to their personalities. Nebula and Rocket, in particular, experiences a noteworthy transformation that showcases the film's commitment to character growth.Another brilliant aspect of this movie is the clever use of the soundtrack enhances the overall fun and immersive nature of the movie.Furthermore, the visual effects are a true marvel, surpassing the shortcomings of previous MCU releases. The CGI is impeccably executed, and the vibrant color contrast beautifully captures the awe-inspiring wonders of the galaxy. Lastly, the movie's breathtaking visuals are complemented by astonishing makeup work cant be overlooked.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 solidifies its place as the best Marvel trilogy to date, I think it even surpassed the Captain America trilogy. As the final chapter in the Guardians saga, it delivers a poignant and satisfying ending that leaves viewers with a sense of bittersweet melancholy. The realization that we won't see the original Guardians ensemble again is truly sad. This movie is truly a cinematic gem. Director James Gunn's visionary direction, coupled with outstanding performances and remarkable visual effects, creates an unforgettable movie experience.

Art--movies included of course--loves its outcasts. \"Star Wars\"--arguably the most iconic sci-fi series of all time--was all about rebels fighting against oppressive imperialism. This ideology is picked up further even by blockbuster-oriented projects like the MCU and is at its most visible here, in \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\", at least since Ryan Coogler's 2018 \"Black Panther\".The movie's villain is known only as The High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji)--a compulsively obsessed scientist with a God complex driven by nothing other than perfection. He has developed a scientific (well, sci-fi) method of speed-running lifeforms through millions of years of natural evolution in order to create a perfect civilization. I think the authoritarian approach--depicted in such an extreme view--is visible here. Obviously, the movie doesn't get too deep about it. But while it keeps a safe distance from politics, it touches a bit on psychology. The High Evolutionary comes out as an insecure villain, one who is frustrated when one of his creations outsmarts him. Again, the movie doesn't delve deep into these ideas either, as this is not its purpose. Still, the simple fact that they are being touched upon is enough.Probably what you're most interested about is whether this is a proper Marvel movie. Which means: is it funny, is it visually stunning and is it entertaining? The answer to all those questions is yes even if not in equal measure. The comedy still lands most of the time, with each member of the gang filling their role as they should: from Chris Pratt's loveable and dorky Starlord, Pom Klementieff's awkward Mantis and not to mention Dave Bautista's Drax the Destroyer--he is still the whole-hearted big guy we all love. Actors will always improve at their role if they play it long enough. Directors know this, and James Gunn really puts his characters through many interactions, contradictions and heated arguments. The amount of characters the movie tries to juggle can make it unwieldly sometimes, but nonetheless they are all comfortable in the positions they are in. Visually, it's still a treat. Except the Dr. Strange movies, the Guardians series offer the best visual set-pieces and each movie ups the previous one with this one being no exception--that's entertainment.That being said, this is also the most tear-jerking of the three movies--and also among the entire MCU franchise--it revolves around Rocket (Bradley Cooper) and his tragic and disturbing origin story. At the beginning, he is attacked and spends most of the movie on life support. From there, the movie forks into flashbacks describing his creation. While those flashbacks, depicting him in cages recall dark ages in humanity's past they also cheat a bit into getting to you. Here, James Gunn uses the fact that humanity tends to show more empathy towards animals than fellow humans even though we should consider humans more precious--if you saw the movie, you will know what I mean. There is something about the purity and innocence of our less sentient friends that we feel we must defend. It's a cheap shot, but I admit it got to me.But of course it did. This is \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\", the third installment in the Marvel's \"Guardians\" sub-series so why did it not feel special? It has nothing to do with the movie and I apologize if you find this answer ambiguous. What I mean is that while the first two movies felt like an event, this one feels like just another one in an ever-growing expansion. A drop in the ocean. Maybe it's simply because the MCU has become increasingly big, with more plotlines moving in parallel than ever before. Or maybe, we've gotten used to the experience of Marvel movies after more than a decade of them.

It's time to add another one to that list. \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\" is a more than fitting conclusion to the narrative of these characters. James Gunn (writer/director) took his time creating connections and depth to each of the individual story-arcs.While recent films in the MCU have felt like \"filler episodes\" whose purpose is solely to set up a future entry in the franchise, this film stands on its own. The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality. In more ways than one, \"Guardians 3\" is a unique entry in an otherwise convoluted extended film universe.The filmmakers were not afraid to take their time telling this story, which caused the film to drag at times. Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie. A headache was imminent, as much of the third act was screaming match after screaming match. While these scenes were emotionally heavy, the yelling distracted a bit from the strong acting.\"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\" is one of the better entries in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since \"Avengers: Endgame\". Though more chaotic than the other two films in the trilogy, it is a beautiful conclusion to the Guardians' story.

Luckily, on this one, his imprint is marked all over this thing.For starters, this movie flies by, I didn't even feel the run time in the slightest. Maybe some scenes could have been chopped out, but I wouldn't know which one to choose. Sometimes the film can be a bit confusing, but I feel like thats just because the movie is really chalked full of stuff.Loved the action, some very fun cinematography. There were some VERY fun long takes that looked incredibly well choreographed. Boring soundtrack, kinda exactly what you would expect tbh. It was standard Marvel and standard guardians of the galaxy soundtrack. Radiohead's creep is the most overrated radiohead song.Thought that some of the performances could have been a bit better. Mantis occasionally made me cringe but was overall fine, Chris Pratt kinda the same. There was a scene with Rocket where he was talking at a higher octave and it sounded like an adult trying to imitate a child's voice and it was abhorrent. Usually Bradley Cooper does fine, but honestly he felt like he kinda phoned it in on this one through the whole movie. Cgi was mostly awesome, but there was a scene when they were in space suits that looked oddly gummy. Like their suits were very weirdly stretching around and being funky. Looked like a computerReally why this movie works is the combination of high stakes intensely well made action, coherent story telling and relatively funny jokes. The film also does a good job at tugging at your heartstrings... Pretty tightly I may add. This is definitely the most intense emotional driven Marvel movie since infinity war imo, there are some heart wrenching scenes in this one and seriously great character growth through the film.Overall, even though this is a bit formulated, its my favorite Guardians movie and my favorite Marvel movie since Infinity war. I love the direction James Gunn went here and I'm glad to see him have a bit more creative freedom on this one. A lot of the falling flat here is so menial it barely effects the movie.

They were an unknown group with heroes that were even more unknown than Iron Man (at the time). However, thanks to director James Gunn, he made them one of the most popular Marvel characters and team. I loved the first one and it is still up there in one of my favourite Marvel films. The second one is a great movie but not as good as the first one. There is a joke that the 3rd movie is always the worst which did occur with Ant-Man recently. Does Guardians of the Galaxy fall into this or does it deliver an epic trilogy?One of the core themes in the Guardian of the Galaxy movies is family and loss. This is still prevalent here and still as powerful. We see the Guardians feel closer as a family than ever but also argue a lot like family too. In terms of character arcs, Peter is still reeling from the loss of Gamora, Yondu and even his mother which is making him go to the bottles. His struggles stem from self-blame for those losses and becoming more protective of his current family, The Guardians. He has conflicts with alternate Gamora who he still sees as his Gamora which she is having none of. Nebula is also a stand-out character this time with her being a member of the Guardians and not an antagonist. She has great interactions with everyone and her character arc is a great one. The character that is the major focus of GotG3 is Rocket. We finally get his backstory which is so dark and heartbreaking that it genuinely brought a tear to my eye. Mantis and Drax are still the idiot duo but they get some emotional moments and even cool scenes where they shine. Likewise, Groot, Kraglin and talking dog Cosmo are mostly just there but they get moments to shine too.On that note, the return actors continue to do a great job in the role. They all get to flex more of their emotions due to this more emotional entry. Special praise to Bradley Cooper as Rocket who gives a stunning voice performance. Additionally, I must praise Chukwudi Iwuji's performance as the villain High Evolutionary. He gives a full-on narcissistic, zealous and unhinged performance that makes him so hateable. Another standout element from this series is the music and its incorporation of non-mainstream pop songs. James continues to use great songs such as \"In the Meantime\" by Spacehog and he uses them in great ways that benefit the movie. One difference this time is the use of some more popular songs such as \"Creep\" by Radiohead and \"Dog Days Are Over\" by Florence and the Machines. Nevertheless, they are used satisfyingly that I don't mind their use.There are a couple of awesome action scenes. The ones that come to mind are the fight against Adam Warlock where we get to see the guardians struggle against a powerful foe. Moreover, there is a phenomenal one-shot-looking action scene that illustrates all the Guardian's fighting prowess and it was so cool. The costumes and set design are well-designed. I love how creative the world is with the unique-looking planets and different alien species. Most of the aliens are done using prosthetics and they look great! The story itself is quite basic as it is mostly a fetch quest but the emotional payoff to all the characters' arcs is extremely satisfying. We get what feels like a proper ending to the original Guardians team that I wouldn't be angry if this is the last we see of these characters.However, I do have some minor gripes with the movie. Adam Warlock who was teased since Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2 is finally here but he doesn't feel that meaningful to the plot. He is just there to be a nuisance rather than a significant antagonist. Him having the mindset of a child just makes him slightly lame. One common superhero movie issue is the vague villain powers which are also here. The High Evolutionary seems to be able to use telekinesis or emit giant energy blasts but never seems to do it against the Guardians when he should. Alternate Gamora was one of the biggest challenges as it was a Gamora with none of the character development from the first 2 films. In this film, she comes off as way too cold and aggressive than the Gamora of previous films which makes her not that likeable. Although, you could argue that was the whole point as she isn't the same Gamora, plus she does have her character arc. There is also a weird Nebula and Peter subplot that is hinted at but never amounts to anything.Overall, what an amazing end to the trilogy! With MCU projects lately being kind of subpar, it was great to finally have an entry that delivers. We now have another entry in great MCU trilogies with Captain America, Tom Holland's Spiderman and now Guardians of the Galaxy. I don't know what is going to happen with the Guardians of the Galaxy movies now that James Gunn is done and moving to DC. Nevertheless, I am looking forward to what James does as head of DC and I can't wait to see what new direction the Guardians go in.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 6, "votes": 11}, "heading": "Yes I am crying about a CGI raccoon", "date": "2023-05-13T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9053169", "sentiment score": [0.0074, 0.0456, 0.1489, 0.6119, 0.1863]}, {"content": "Look it wrapped up the guardians and tied things up in a pretty bow....

The theme of the movie is very dark yet balanced with enough humor and heart. The third installment shows how much James Gunn loves the franchise. Gunn earmarked his viewers to understand the monstrosities of being unmade and converted, imposing a story of empathy and heart that only few Marvel movies have accomplished and making every bit of natural humor to lighten its heavy theme. Gunn masterfully explored a new team dynamic.The last great Marvel movie was Spiderman: No Way Home, and after that, everything turned out chaotic and disinteresting. Volume 3 is a perfect send-off for the GOTG franchise, a perfect film to conclude an incredible Marvel trilogy. What I love about this movie is how every character is well-realized. We get to see each character go to emotional places that they haven't gone to before. Every character is well utilized and even the side characters have their time to shine.Chris Pratt, as always, showed charm and humor that is true to his character, which works every time. The chemistry between Nebula, Drax, and Mantis is well delivered; we discovered new things from these characters. Zoe Saldana as the new Gamora was also great and I appreciate how they did not compromise her character. Instead, they demonstrated that the new Gamora was different from the Gamora that we loved. And Rocket is the heart of GOTG Volume 3, everything about Rocket is the core of this film. One subtle thing that I also love is the ending, when Groot said, \"I love you guys,\" this means that, as an audience, we finally understand Groot after all the \"I am Groot,\" this supports how Gamora finally understands Groot in the end. These subtle details make this film a perfect conclusion to the whole franchise.The only problem I have with this film is how wasted Adam Warlock's character is. Adam Warlock was introduced as this strong creature during the first half of the movie, and I even thought that his character will become pivotal to the movie, but they kinda wasted it. Some choices made to his character along the way were neglected, which resulted in his character looking like an immature creature, with no direction or proven power. This is not even Will Poulter's fault; his character was just not given enough recognition when it comes to the script.When Layla said, \"You were right, the sky was beautiful,\" I cried so hard because my dog just died last week, and it gives me assurance how happy he is now that he was in the sky. Despite its dark and heavy theme, it is still a very funny and entertaining movie to watch. Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 is, by far, one of the strongest entries in the post-Endgame epoch.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 takes audiences on another wild and wacky ride back to space - but does it soar as high as its predecessors?

That's the first song you hear in GOG vol. 3 and it is a fitting song for a group of characters that embraces weirdness, silliness and pure leaded rollercoaster fun. James Gunn perfected the summer comic-book formula and stuck to it. The tone is darker, which is unavoidable given that the origin story present focuses on animal experimentation, but it gives weight to the movie, which has been lacking in the MCU.The general opinion I heard was that this was the best MCU entry in a long time, because it was so fun to watch. The humor, the music, the over-the-top characters and settings. Is not a cinematic masterpiece but is a solid MCU film and definitely worth it if you are a fan of James Gunn style and the GOG characters in particular.In comparing the 3 volumes, I would say the 2nd is definitely the slowest paced and the least fun. I found 3 to not be that behind from no 1, perhaps the first being better just for its freshness and less worn-out humor. I found the villain in 3 to be better. The performance is over-the-top and pure evil with a solid motivation, lacking just a touch of depth. I don't remember the villain from n\u00ba1 at all.THE BAD\nSome elements are wasted, though, such as Adam Warlock and the sovereigns, which are used just as a segway for the main plot to unfold. Also, Contra-earth gets a lot of screen-time with the bat-characters, supposedly to give weight to its destruction, but lacks depth, since these characters didn't talk at all. I didn't care at all about contra-earth, it was just a filler for the villain evilness. Other characters that could been fleshed out were the villain's supporters, the betrayal in the end felt adequate, but quite hollow as well.CONTROVERSIES?I can't imagine being able to find any controversy in a silly summer film, but since it's 2023, everything is political now. Animal experimentation seems to me to be the only theme that can rustle some feathers, but I felt the way the film presented it was correct, focusing on the characters' emotions. We never hear any character commenting on the particularities of the hard topics other than \"he is just evil\". The topic is not the focus, just a connection between the protagonist and the antagonist.THE CONCLUSION\nA fun, silly and entertaining final(?) entry in the Guardians saga that's definitely worth a return to the cinema, if you have been away from MCU for some time.I reckon that fans of the Guardians (not counting trolls) that didn't enjoy particularly this entry is because they don't like Rocket that much, and the humor/formula is getting old to them.Grade Solid 8, perhaps 8,5.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "TLDR: Solid MCU film, darker, with some filler characters but fun to watch.", "date": "2023-05-12T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9050586", "sentiment score": [0.0082, 0.0782, 0.4516, 0.4312, 0.0308]}, {"content": "Hopeful movie in the last unfortunate MCU.

Rocket suffered from animal testing, and how terrible it was for Guardians who watched the surgery to the end, and Nebula said that Nebula was even more terrible than him. Not only Rocket but also various animals have been tested, and their appearance is hideous. It seems to have clearly conveyed a negative image of animal testing with a High Evolutionary that ignores animal ecology and incredibly belittles life.

The way he has realised every one of these characters is just very admirable. And that's how he's able to make an emotional script with these characters. This can be said again for the 3rd movie. Once again all these characters are very well realised, and there's just something funny, adorable and family-like about their interactions. But I don't like how the second half concluded this movie.The visual effects are brilliant once again, and it feels a lot more cleaner and colorful this time around. The soundtrack is different in this movie from the previous ones. And that's because the tone too is a lot more serious and emotional this time around.But my favourite part about this movie was how these characters interacted. Most of the time they just argued with each other and that's what made their bonds so precious and genuine. I loved how Nebula's and Mantis' characters were realised.And I love how James Gunn handled the character of Rocket. I know he gets a lot of the spotlight in this movie, but even in the previous movies, James Gunn used to build his character up in a very subtle way. As if it was all leading up to this moment.I did say though that I didn't like how they wrapped up the movie.I think a lot of potential was wasted, which is why I wasn't that impacted with how this movie concluded. I personally would have loved for this story to be split up into 2 parts. I would've loved to see so many things explored in depth. Because there's a lot going on in this movie. Along with handling all these characters individually, this movie also tries to build many conflicts and bonds between them, while trying to fit in some new characters at the same time. So after setting up everything brilliantly in the first half. The second half just wraps up those plotlines, just like that.

Has it finally arrives in cinemas on the big screen & it's a swan song to the galactic universe. So let's get started, I adored this film from start to finish this has to be one of the best Marvel Studios films so far well I say that every time but it is tho. All of these characters and the team was created so brilliantly, it brought it all to life very amazingly. We get a very in-depth backstory once again to keep us up to date with its heroes, mainly one in particular Rocket Raccoon who has a very interesting, touching and heartfelt flashback sequences.As somebody who is a fan of the GOTG, this film certainly hits home hard with its loving friendship themes. Gunn does a fantastic job of doing so with the filmmaking. There was plenty of wowing moments with a little touch of horror sprinkled in throughout, in which I was so surprised to see it unfold.Watching Vol 3 these was not a dull moment throughout the entire film. Loaded with fantastic special effects, sentimental sturdy relationships and a solid storyline with plenty of space to laugh and cry.The director James Gunn has successfully built an unique personality's for each characters, I love to see a massive leap in Mantis characteristics she is funny as always and so is Dave Bautista as Drax really funny with so little words or phrases he says and trying to put metaphors together. Nebula is still angry and easily gets pissed off but deep down inside she's vulnerable and craving for a loving family. I don't know what to say about Rocket without spoiling it so I'm just going to say that he was presented greatly along with Groot.The music was so great that made the film more touching and entertaining the vibes were just pure entertainment.James Gunn has a clear vision to deliver on this end of an era for the Guardians saga for the audience and the long time Marvel fans and he overachieved this so fanatically.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 is everything and more from what I could of asked for to close a superhero trilogy, it's truly James Gunns best film to date and it's not even worth arguing.

The costume design, set pieces and visuals are spectacular and what you expect from this series.

You are just a brilliant director.Starlord (@prattprattpratt), Drax The Destroyer (@davebautista) and Rocket Raccoon (Bradley Cooper) have always been my favourites in this super-crazy team and all these three superheroes played their roles perfectly. The intelligence and bravery of Starlord, the technical genius abilities of Rocket and the physical strength of Drax have always been like the three batteries of the Guardians for ages.The only female character who did a good job was the blue daughter of Thanos.

You already might know the reason for that and I still miss him a lot after he had sacrificed himself to save Peter's life in GOTG Vol 2.

You may wonder if there even can be a Guardians movie without him at the helm ... the future will show us. The movie has it all - it plants and it sows. It has the humor you have been expecting it to have - and the characters are true to themselves. There are throwaway characters that get their moment to shine (looking at you carrot face), you have good boys and bad boys (and good boys being called bad boy - well you'll know when you watch the movie) ... and many other things. Oh and we get a lot of cameos - one I almost confused with Stan Lee. They are allowed to use his image now - but it was Lloyd Kaufman. Good for him and Gunn to have him in this. Also Howard the Duck and so many other people/characters, that you probably will spot - especially if you are into the comics.The movie I expected nothing from grew on me - and if you have no emotions at all after watching this - someone has to check your pulse. Kidding aside, this is a love letter to Science Fiction, to comedy - and it has the very first \"f\"-word of the MCU ... one would expect it to come from Samuel L. Jackson .. but we get surprised (not just by this fact) ... and Chris Pratt is the one to utter it. And the great thing is, you may not even notice it - because it is just so fitting - the way it is delivered ... it just rolls of the tongue and the scene warrants it - it would have worked without it ... but I am not complaining they included it.Visual effects are good - something that many did complain about (rightfully mostly I reckon) in the previous movies. But it is the story that holds this together and makes us fall in love with everyone. Or to quote someone and bring my review to an end: I love you guys - another one you may not entirely notice, but a big moment! I am ... satisfied!

Rocket takes most of the spotlight in this threequel, but every character manages to get their shine and receives a suitable sendoff.

In this case, I am torn, in that while this is of course a fictional tale, how far is it from the reality of the lives of so many animals even in this day and age?

Marvel, take what has worked in the past, take notes, hire some talented writers/filmmakers, and stop making everything have a social or political message.

I hope someone reads it and shares the same intensity as me, maybe someone has already shared it. I have been a Marvel fan for a long time, and I can easily say that this movie is good, but it is also sad that it took me 3 days to post this review, and I am really overwhelmed right now, let me start.First of all, I want to talk about the team and harmony. I cannot list the actors one by one, nor the technical team, but I can easily say that everything was good, even though it sometimes tended to be too clich\u00e9, I think the script was not bad; it was even much better than the last 7-8 Marvel movies. I thank James Gunn for making me feel these emotions and for writing a good ending for the original team.Let me explain my favorite part, Rocket... The story of Rocket was well-incorporated into the plot and the script, and it was extremely critical for a superhero movie. I think it was also very strong and special because it contained animal rights references with the backstory of our character who suffered torture, and it made me feel very emotional, especially when he became the leader of the new team just like in the comics.If we look at the overall movie, there are 2-3 plot errors, but they blended 2 storylines very well. Additionally, the action scenes were quite good, and although I read a lot of comments stating that there was not enough action in some parts, I disagree; the action was appropriate. Although Gamora's story did not satisfy me much, I don't think it was bad either. However, I think the stories of Drax, Groot, Mantis, and Nebula were quite normal and good, and the idea of not killing anyone in the team was also good; it was appropriate for them to lead a normal life. I do not know if the new team will make us feel as emotional as the old team, but it is definitely exciting.My disappointments were the portrayal of Adam Warlock and our villain, High Evolutionary. Although the motivation of our villain was good, due to some bad screenplay choices, he did not fit perfectly as the clearest and well-intentioned villain of Marvel in recent times. (I would like to add a little note here: there was a bit too much over-acting sometimes, which bothered me.) Adam Warlock was a huge disappointment; they shaved off many parts of the character by taking him out of the cocoon early, while he was supposed to be a much more serious and harsh character, I hope his character development will be much better. Because his baby-like behavior in the movie was too long and boring, which was very frustrating. Gamora was also a bit different; in short, I don't know even the Gamora of the same timeline, they confused this issue a bit.The movie was good in terms of technical and CGI aspects. Although I have not liked the CGI that Marvel has done lately, it was quite good in this movie, which made me very happy. The use of music was also the best I've seen lately. It was a fantastic detail that was extremely well placed, despite a lot of music.In short, the place of this trilogy is very special for me. It was a good choice to make this movie emotional, and in some parts, it was really difficult to hold back tears, and I was amazed by Rocket's scene of losing his friends. Of course, there are minor problems, but I did not feel them because the strong parts were much better, and the movie flowed smoothly like water. I hope we will see these characters again...Note: I also thought Star-Lord's return to Earth was a great idea, Drax becoming a father, Nebula becoming a leader, Mantis being free, Rocket becoming a leader, and Groot accompanying him, all of it was fitting. When I left the movie, I felt strange because I didn't think about its missing parts, but rather how emotional and fragile life can be.

Well for me, this is the least \"Guardians\" movie in the trilogy, in the sense that when you watch it, you can't help but feel like there's something missing, i believe this comes from the fact that we are watching \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" without 2 guardians, namely Gamora which for me is perhaps the biggest disappointment of the film, they made her so unnecessarily agressive and evil, in GOTG1, while she was still working for Thanos there were already several remnats of kindness in her, plus she doesn't really serves a purpose on the movie, shes just there and at the end she chooses to live with the Marauders anyway so what was the point ?

That back-story is important, and it helps drive the dislike for the villains. But the amount of time spent focusing on it was not only unnecessary, but detracted from the rest of the story. This movie could have been great for everyone, but Gunn went too far with it and will alienate younger audiences, parents whose kids will be affected, and animal lovers.Not only does portray animal cruelty, but these animals are also kids themselves. So, Gunn's hubris has him not only pushing the envelope on cruelty, but also pushing the envelope on what happens to KIDS in movies! Let's find the cutest adolescent animals, give them human personalities and child-like voices, then put them in the middle of Halloween Town, make sure everyone is aware of the torture they've been through, create some empathy, then kill then anyway.

Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 (2023), will also answer some of the questions, about what the future holds for these cherished characters. It's safe to say, that it's not the end, but more of a transition, because the actors might change, but the characters are part of Marvel's canon of characters. They may come back someday, but this is the end of line for this group of filmmakers, performers and this particular storyline. The main ingredient being the real-world reality, that actors age and eventually need to be replaced. If there was no such thing as aging, this group could continue forever. That is a commentary on how loved they are to the audience and fans alike. James Gunn serves up a plate of emotions in this film, that helps the audience feel included in the celebrations.A very influential entity in Marvel's canon of characters is the High Evolutionary. He is responsible for the creation of many characters from Marvel's history, most notably, the creation of Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper). This is the point where the film takes root or maybe Groot (voice of Vin Diesel), as a launching pad for the rest of the film. It's the desire of the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji), to take his evolutionary science to the next level, no matter how atrocious it may be. He needs to capture Rocket, in order to solve the mystery of the racoon's amazing brilliance. It is this part of the film, that shows how good Marvel and Gunn are. Marvel has always been known for having an important message embedded into the plot of their films and comic books. In this case, it is a commentary on animal rights, being humane and that age-old science fiction example of not playing a god. The High Evolutionary thinks he is a god and therefore answers to no one. This is why the Guardians have to stop him and save Rocket.The set-up begins with Rocket, who becomes injured, after Adam Warlock (Will Poulter), the now, uncocooned super-creation of his creator/mother Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), tries to capture Rocket, from orders from the High Evolutionary. The injury to Rocket sets off a kill-switch inside his robotic implants, thus sending Star-Lord and the gang out to find the file download, that will turn off the switch. We are than introduced to a wide array of unique, sometimes frightening, genetically altered creatures, that the High Evolutionary has created. We also get to see what happens with all of our heroes and what their futures will be. The film has the emotions, the action, the plot, the Marvel magic and the performances of the cast, who express this intellectual property, the way it should be. The problem lies in the pacing, which slows the film down a little. It is still a very good film, but definitely ranks third out of the three films. This may be a good thing though, because the way they marketed this film as a finality, didn't really feel like an end at all, but more of a new beginning. That lack of ending made things feel more like hope. It was all in the emotions.7.8 (B- MyGrade) = 8 IMDB.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 4, "votes": 6}, "heading": "The Emotions Are High in the Third Installment", "date": "2023-05-10T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9045907", "sentiment score": [0.012, 0.0692, 0.3079, 0.5358, 0.0752]}, {"content": "I'm not one to cry at movies often, but this one broke me.

The next point regarding Rocket's origin connects well with the antagonist's motivations, since his reasons, plans, and vision are somewhat reminiscent of The Island Of Doctor Moreau.

Now, 9 years later, this unlikely crew has evolved into a family, and it's time for them to face the music. The \"music\" comes in the form of the High Evolutionary, the film's antagonist and Rocket's \"creator\". When one of the Guardians is wounded, the rest of the team must race against time to save their friend. Along the way, they're taken to some unique locations you won't soon forget.

Besides the Guardians themselves, another cheer-worthy aspect of the movie is the music. In true James Gunn fashion, Guardians Vol. 3 treats its soundtrack almost as a character itself, utilizing it in a way that elevates and enhances the entire movie. Also, I have to give specific praise to the ending. This film contains, without exaggeration, one of my favorite final scenes of all time. It's bittersweet, heartfelt, joyous, and beautiful. I seriously don't think I've been this moved by a movie since 'Avengers: Endgame'. As a whole, 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3' is a fun, action-packed roller coaster of emotions full of unforgettable moments, and easily one of the MCU's best installments.

I loved the first and liked the second, so my expectations were high but were blown out of the water for this one. In some way, it was similar to Thor Ragnar\u00f6k (2017), a third movie that had no right to be as funny and touching as it was.Firstly, this is Rocket's movie. Throughout the franchise, it's been alluded that our favourite raccoon has had a traumatic past, having been mechanically altered into a cyborg type animal. Here, the film doesn't stray away from the disturbing details, regarding his imprisonment, how he was used as a puppet for tests and the loss of his friends, explaining his attitude and trust issues. The flashbacks to his past were the most emotional for me. The audience could tell that Rocket's fellow mechanically altered mates weren't getting out of this alive, which might have been predicable but heart-breaking, nonetheless.Despite this, all the guardians got their time to shine in this film. Big ensemble films usually struggle to fit in the time for the side characters or they do, and it becomes muddled. In this film however, I felt satisfied with all the character's arcs, e.g Nebula finally appreciating her crewmates and Quill finally being able to let Gamora go and accept that he can't change her into the girl she once was. It felt mature, instead of changing the natural course of the characters just for the sake of a happy Hollywood ending.In regard to the writing and directing, it's regular scheduled programming for a marvel film. There's a bad guy that wants to take over the world and has emotional ties to one of the heroes. (GOTG 1 it was Thanos and Gamora, GOTG 2 it was Ego and Quill and now it's the High Evolutionary and Rocket). Pretty formulaic as far as marvel plots go. There are the quips, the funny one time side characters (Nathan Fillion's comes to mind), the faceless monsters that act as an excuse for a cool action scene, quirky side quests and the endless carnage with high amounts of collateral damage. But wait, there's an ending DANCE MONTAGE. That makes it a completely different and unique film, right?This leads me to my criticisms; it felt too safe. There were not one, but 2 occasions where they lead you to believe that a main character is going to die but they are miraculously saved. I understand there must be the cookie cutter ending that Kevin Feige orders but there could have been another Yondu moment instead of taking the safer route circa Stranger Things season 4. I can forgive this though as the emotional beats throughout the film were strong enough on their own.Final gripe was the soundtrack. Don't know if it was just me, but I felt it wasn't as memorable or good as the first 2 films. The GOTG franchise has been synonymous with a quality set list of old hits, but I thought the cuts on this didn't hit the same beats as the others.I had a blast watching this film.

There's more and more that's good to know before you see the sequel to such-and-such, and there's more and more teasing being done for stuff that's set to happen in the future -- coming soon to a Chromecast near you!But now, with the final (?) entry in the Guardians of the Galaxy series, I do declare that we have one. One solid trilogy that can be viewed just fine as its own thing and may be remembered as the best, most accessible one from the MCU. There's still stuff that will seem strange if you haven't seen Infinity War and Endgame and don't know of the demise of Zoe Salda\u00f1a's Gamora, or the time-travel nonsense that brought her back, but the film is written in such a way that this doesn't feel strictly mandatory.There's even a scene where Peter \"Star-Lord\" Quill, played again by Chris Pratt, references a slew of convoluted off-screen events to explain Gamora's resurgence and eventually gives up trying to make sense of it. For those who are only here for the Guardians films, it's believable that such a topsy-turvy adventure would've taken place in the years since the last movie; if you do know the other Avengers films -- and are as sick of it all as I am -- you'll appreciate the meta-humor. In true James Gunn fashion, there's more to the comedy here than you may expect from the MCU. (Some elements seem to lampoon not only the MCU project, but the very Disney empire itself.)What truly sets it apart, especially from the more recent titles, is the way Gunn treats his characters. Almost everything lately -- especially the nigh-insufferable Thor: Love and Thunder -- has leaned harder into the MCU's humorous side than ever. But this is often done in the form of characters treating everything, including themselves, as a joke.Gunn makes some of the weirder movies in the MCU, yet his characters never feel like SNL parodies; they're completely genuine -- at least, nobody is as much of a joke as Tazerface in the previous film. Yes, some scenes in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 are ruined by comedy, but they're usually jokes that make sense for the characters, particularly Mantis and Drax's absolutely hopeless social skills, and frequently get a laugh.The actors still seem to greatly enjoy the roles, as well. Pratt, Salda\u00f1a, Dave Bautista, Pom Klementieff, Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel, Karen Gillan, and Sean Gunn reprise their roles from the previous films, and Chukwudi Iwuji plays the twisted High Evolutionary, who has a decidedly dark history with Cooper's Rocket Raccoon. (These flashbacks constitute the best scenes in the movie, giving us one of the most memorably loathsome MCU villains in many years.) We also -- somewhat pointlessly -- get Adam Warlock, whose nature in the tapestry of the comics' reality I won't even try to explain (it involves cause-and-effect being wholly meaningless to him).Warlock does look fairly accurate (especially Will Poulter's eyebrows), bar the fact that his costume suffers the usual MCU-isms -- strips, pads, and anything that makes these costumes look over-designed and samey, as if all these different cultures and interstellar beings go to the same tailor -- where nothing pops or is \"too colorful\" or \"too goofy\". Still, like Vol. 2 (albeit not as much), the movie offers some of the more vibrant and interesting MCU sceneries, full of alien realms that look inviting despite the fact that everything probably wants to kill you. We even get some body horror and nasty critters (again: hilariously unsettling, yet cute and loveable), recalling Gunn's early days of B-horror nostalgia. Of course, Gunn also puts more thought into the use of licensed music than, say, the likes of The Super Mario Bros. Movie.All-in-all, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 may be exactly what the Marvel Cinematic Universe needs. The consensus seems to be that the MCU is riding on this film and that, following the less-than-desirable box office numbers of Thor 4 and Quantumania, it's all down to Gunn; if Guardians 3 fails to make bank, it may be time to accept that the MCU is finally done. As it seems, however, people are really into this movie.In between its annoyances, it hits that sweet spot -- while also being kooky -- like only Gunn knows how. Brian Tallerico correctly identified him as \"one of the few filmmakers who has operated in the massive system of the biggest movie money-making factory in the world without sacrificing his voice\" and was even more on-point when writing that he \"loves his outcasts\". The film is certainly not perfect (weird character decisions and wasted potential are its worst non-tone-related issues), but considering everything else that's being put forth by Disney as of late, \"not perfect\" seems pretty damn incredible -- and also, considering the themes of the story, pretty apt.", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Hooked on a feeling to the end", "date": "2023-05-09T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9045249", "sentiment score": [0.0134, 0.0601, 0.1647, 0.5501, 0.2117]}, {"content": "Apart from \"Spiderman\" and \"Guardians of the galexy\" i can either take or leave the marvel movies that get churned out one after the other these days.

Putting a tree, a raccoon and other random characters in a film was not the norm, not for a marvel movie anyway.That turned out to be a great decision on their part.Nearly a decade later, it may not have been as fantastic as they hoped.Lets begin.The premise of the movie is simple, and takes no time to get into. Rocket is injured, and they set off to save him after their emergency life kit cannot do so without killing him. This journey has them travel across the galaxy looking for a man called the High Evolutionary, who is hands down the best character in the movie.What follows is a heartfelt backstory into Rockets past, which was the most incredible part of the film.Everything else however, does not match up to this.The story and editing do not make much sense. Characters randomly pop in with no build up even after years of waiting, and do not add anything of note to the story. The editing is all over the place, with scenes just abdruptly going to the next without any smooth transitition or sequence to them.The characters are constantly being loud to emphasize the jokes, which are not good to begin with.This movie is surprisingly dark for a marvel movie, with some shocking deaths and scary scenes that feel like a dumbed down version of the suicide squad.I understand that being fired and then rehired would result in a haphazard production like this, but it's not an acceptable excuse though.The ending does not have any real buildup, and does not make sense as well. Gamora didn't have to fall in love with Peter, but her utter disregard for him is unfounded and served no purpose to the story. She could have been absent altogether, and nothing would change. Same for Adam Warlock. Such wasted potential.I suppose that there will always be an end to any franchise, and the movie does kind of send them on their own journeys quite well. I just didn't think a 2 hour 29 min runtime was enough for this, especially with how quickly they decide to split right at the very end.There are too many plots in this movie, and only one paid off; Rockets backstory.All in all, it was a decent time at the theatre, and a sweet farewell to our guardians.

So, after I saw \"Guardians 3\", I sat down to ponder why I love this trilogy so much - more than any other in the MCU. All these ingredients were evident in James Gunn's newest directorial effort, but a few key features were obvious to me this time around - silliness and idiosyncrasy.That's what makes the \"Guardians\" trilogy so enjoyable and unique. The characters have wonderful chemistry. They are fun and quirky, and they reverberate with my funny bone and my heart strings with a wide gamut of different emotions.Yes, it's true that \"Guardians 3\" is also probably the most touching of the three films. Often cruel, disturbing, and sad, the film focuses considerably on the origins of Rocket Raccoon and the brutal animal experimentation he endured. Yes, some scenes are hard to watch, but at the end of the day it's the loyalty, unity, and camaraderie of these superhero misfits that win me over.There's plenty of laughter in \"Guardian 3\" stemming from the dynamics between the characters, whether it's poking fun at Drax's gentle-giant ineptness, Mantis' turn as the empathic, explore-your-feelings therapist type, or Gamora's new bitchy, stand-offish nature. The best performance in the film belongs to Chris Pratt as Quill/Star-Lord, who manages to maintain his usual cockiness but also turns to great vulnerability and tenderness as he struggles reconnect with the \"new\" Gamora and save his best friend...or second-best friend...you'll know what I mean when you watch the film.Where \"Guardians 3\" gets a tad messy is in its fleshing out of many different characters including a goofy and confused Adam Warlock, played by Will Poulter, and an uber annoying megalomaniac in The High Evolutionary, played by Chukwudi Iwuji. The latter, even though a terrifying threat in the same vein as Thanos, must be hands-down the most irritating villain in the MCU. Both these characters, especially Warlock, are just sort of flat and trite in their development.Volume 3's soundtrack is also quite eclectic and memorable. There are plenty of awesome songs from several decades including the 2000s integrated to match the mood or conflicts in the film. The finale's tune is quite appropriate (I will not mention the song title for spoilers' sake), but the most memorable is the Beatie Boys' \"No Sleep Till Brooklyn'\" as the Guardians team up to siege a ship full of aliens in the film's most jaw-dropping, gravity-defying, camera-loopin'-n-waltzin' around the characters, bullet-time-inspired action scene extravaganza - quite simply the best in the entire series.There is plenty to get excited about and plenty to care about in \"Guardians 3\". There's a lot of talk about whether this movie has the potential to revitalize the MCU after \"Endgame\". Well, that's arguable, I suppose. At the end of the day, this is primarily a James Gunn movie in its sort of campy irreverence and oddities, and I am happy and grateful for that.

It will be right to say that this film is about Rocket Racoon in same way last one was about Peter Quill and first one was about Gamora. I never thought I would love this misfits this much a very very big thanks to James Gunn for making these characters so relatable that we actually feel what is happening to them in this universe.. I won't lie I cried many times throughout the movie because how beautiful this is.. It also has some amazing humour and jokes which lightens up our mood after any heavy moment.. Action is amazing as last 2 films, it has some really good jokes and comedy and a sense of end with these character's journey which was really beautiful.. Rocket Racoon and Nebula got most of the character development throughout this trilogy and the way they end Drax's story made me really cry.. There are some cute animals too like every other Gunn movie whoam you'll love, Will Poulter was also good as Adam Warlock and he has a long road ahead of him in MCU..Chukwudi Iwuji played main villain High Evolutionaty here and he will become one of the most hated villains in entire MCU I'm sure he has his own sense of twisted morality which'll give you hard time to watch just wished they ended him in some another way instead of any other average MCU villain but anyway he is great in his performance, rest of cast is also great in their role especially Zoe Saldana as Gamora.. GOTG trilogy is not just some space action adventure comedy but also an heartfelt drama which teaches us about importance of friends, family and life itself...

I laughed out loud at a lot of the humor. I felt a satisfying anger and need for revenge against the High Evolutionary, and that made it all the more rewarding when Rocket took him down in vengeance for his slain friends.The action is incredible. Brutal, over the top, and classic superhero fare turned up to 11.And the ending! The ending was marvelous. The perfect balance of humor and sadness, making one of the most bittersweet finales to a recent film.Overall, Guardians 3 is absolutely worth your time.

Given how cruel he is to animals surely makes him even more worthy of hating, but in a good way. The way in which you are supposed to not like the bad guy.2) The characters are at their most familial - one of the critics complained that the characters too often are just yelling at each other, but this felt like real family dynamics where the characters are really expressing their frustrations with each other as you would see in any household. Thus when they have moments of vulnerability, it really sinks in.3) Rocket's backstory serves as a much needed anchoring point for the story, something that the other films lacked a little bit as they were almost derivative of Dirty Dozen and Star Wars.4) Though there are some highlights, the soundtrack isn't as good on this one... but not deal breaker.5) I'm not sure if the ending stuck... the closing is fine, it's just that since none of the characters end up dying, despite expectations, I'm left wondering why exactly the characters are splitting up aside from the actors's contracts being up and James Gunn transferring to DC. The story doesn't really support them leaving one another giving how hard they all just fought to keep each other alive, but this is all typical Marvel fare setting the scenarios for future Marvel movies.

Do the guardians still keep up the streak of awesome films in their third and final stand alone outing? HECK YEA! Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3 is not only a fantastic send off to the original cinematic Guardians team but it also stands as one of if not the best Marvel film.Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3 is a film that is mostly centered around our favorite furry Guardian member Rocket Raccoon (who is my personal favorite Marvel character), which meant whenever Adam Warlock decimated Rocket and basically paralyzed him for the rest of the movie I was terrified. Before seeing the film i kinda dreaded seeing it cause I kept hearing online speculation that someone would die and I was worried that it would be Rocket, and I would be lying if I said that this was the least I've cried in a movie cause if I am completely honest I was bawling my eyes out at certain points in the film, especially during Rocket's flashback sequences with Lyla (which is Rocket's girlfriend in the comics) in some of those flashbacks it was pretty hard to watch seeing what the high Evolutionary did to him before he was the Rocket we know now. The part where Rocket is on the edge of death is one of the most emotional scenes I have ever seen in a film, with him about to be in heaven and he meets up with Lyla for one last moment before she tells him that it's not his time yet and that he still has a job to do alive, that scene is so beautifully done and is one of the greatest and most emotional scenes I've ever scene in a film.Now just because the films plot is centered around Rocket it doesn't mean that the other Guardians get their time to shine because each member gets not only their time in the spotlight but also they each get some form of character growth.Throughout the movie we see how Peter Quill (Star-Lord) is still mourning the loss of Gamora in infinity war, and how he feels like everyone he loves just ends up dying or getting taken from him such as his Mom and Gamora. Once he meets the new Gamora (who is from a different timeline) that's truly where his character growth starts as he sees that this Gamora is not the Gamora he knew and fell in love with, and he starts to comes to terms with this over the span of the film.With Drax, his arc comes a bit later on in the film but its about him finding his place and really seeing how he is less of the \"destroyer\" his name suggests and more of a \"Dad\" than he may let on. Nebula's arc is more about her showing more of her sensitive sides and actually slowly showing how she isn't just a murderous robot but she is actually someone who cares about the people of the Galaxy.There's so many great and emotional moments in this film that will not only make you laugh but also cry, smile, cheer and leave feeling like its a great conclusion to these characters story as a team.Overall, I highly suggest this film to anyone who loves these characters or is a Marvel fanatic, even if you haven't seen the first two I think you'll love Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 4, "votes": 9}, "heading": "One final awesome ride for the Guardians trilogy (MAJOR SPOILERS)", "date": "2023-05-09T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9043181", "sentiment score": [0.0085, 0.0393, 0.157, 0.5521, 0.2431]}, {"content": "Don't understand the great reviews.

This is why it really gets boring as you watch it; if you know the outcome, what's really the point to finish it?Also, the villain seems like it was written by an AI, or they got really bored while writing the entire thing, judging by how uni-dimensional it is.Anyway, if you wanna hear Vin Diesel say \"i am groot\" 20 times and wonder why they don't cast somewhat a decent actor or wanna see a Stalone cameo for 10 seconds i guess its worth it, who am i to say?", "rating": 4, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 4, "votes": 8}, "heading": "Has its moments", "date": "2023-05-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9042870", "sentiment score": [0.038, 0.5142, 0.4281, 0.0189, 0.0008]}, {"content": "I had high expectations for this having thoroughly enjoyed the first two.

Adam Warlock attacks the Guardians and causes critical damage to Rocket, and in order to save his friend Peter Quill, Nebula, Swoled Groot, Drax and Mantis embark on a dangerous path that will lead them not only to save Rocket, but also to a million innocent lives.James Gunn's swan song in the MCU and the Guardians of the Galaxy series, came out as the most soulful and tearful project that MARVEL STUDIOS has ever released, without losing its comedic charm mixed with killer humor from previous films, with a nice addition of body horror.The epicenter of the tear eruption is the devastating and tearing prehistory of Rocket, who acts as the focal character of the film and his fellow cellmates who saw the beauty of life, even being crippled by life, which connected them, as well as the relationship with the Guardians, but it is impossible not to add an emotional, though not extreme, completion of the Star Lord storyline and the revelation of Drax, who through layers of testosterone, muscle and stupidity hides a loving father.John Murphy is beautiful, the notes of The Suicide Squad (2021) are recognized, Henry Braham directs the camera department, jewelerily transmitting the depth of the frame using RED's Ranger Monstro and V Raptor and Angenieux Oprimo and Rehoused Leica R lenses in conjunction with the high-quality VFX department.Interesting is the line of the dog Cosmo, who wears a spacesuit with the inscription of the USSR and who is voiced by Bulgarian actress Maria Bakalova, with the ravager Kraglin, played by American actor Sean Gunn, brother of James Gunn, director of GOTG films. He calls her a bad dog the whole movie, which upsets her, knowing that she is not the kind to call her good, at the moment of the final battle in which she saves him.Mantis - Pom Klementieff is charming, and Nebula acts as the co-captain of the team, having gone a long way from developing a killer character to a creator. High Evolutioner is a fierce psychopath-a utopian genius-a destroyer who does not accept the world as it is, listens to classics and inspires fear, Chukwudi Iwuji - bow. Critics wrote that Adam Warlock would be a disappointment for most fans, but this, for me, turned out not to be the case, I saw a character at the beginning of his journey who would develop into an impressive character, albeit with a share of dumbs. And also in the film there is a scattering of cameos of all stripes, in order to determine all you need to sweat a lot.The battle scene in one plan is a delight, but I wanted Faith No More - We Care a Lot, also included in the third Awesome Mix, to play instead of Bestie Boys - No Sleep Till Brooklyn.Thanks to Jimmy Gunn that everyone stayed alive, even though everything was going to this, and was heated from trailers. As Gunn said: \"The first film is a relationship with the mother, the second with the father, the third with themselves.\" All fears were not justified - about the end of the Guardians and Thank God - there is a new imbecile line-up with Phyla-Vell and \"The Legendary Star Lord will return\", and what else can we expect from life in the Marvel Cinematic Universe? 9/10Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 in theaters from May 5.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 7, "votes": 12}, "heading": "Beautiful Sky", "date": "2023-05-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9042714", "sentiment score": [0.0259, 0.1498, 0.3065, 0.4524, 0.0655]}, {"content": "Guardians of the Galaxy 3 review (2023):\nThis is an overview with no spoilersUpsides\n-Peter Quill's new look was amazing with the wavy hair and beard\n-The new comic-accurate suits looked great\n-The cinematography was good\n-A great plot with 'high evolutionary' as the villain and he did a better job as a villain than Marvel's next big bad, Kang the Conqueror.-The acting from brad pitt and Chris Pratt was great\n-Like the other Guardian films, it was hilarious\n-The ending was greatDownsides\n-There were quite a few crude jokes\n-I would've liked to see Peter with his helmet on\n-Adam Warlock was wasted potential and they went from having him as a cool post-credit scene in GOTG. 2 to making him a grown-up superhero Eustace\n-The soundtrack was alright, nothing too memorable, unfortunately.Overall I thought it was a very emotional film and not what I expected when I watched the trailer.Unlike a lot of Marvel films recently, the cgi was actually good, although there were a few shots which looked a bit strange, especially with Gamora's robotics and it's the best film of the trilogy and possibly the best film since Avengers Endgame.8.7/10.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 4, "votes": 8}, "heading": "One of the most emotional MCU films ever!", "date": "2023-05-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9042679", "sentiment score": [0.0214, 0.0913, 0.2813, 0.5537, 0.0522]}, {"content": "James Gunn saves Marvel phase 5!

I don't get it out of the possible idea that kids seeing kids on screen will make them like it more when that's not how it works, make loud noises and bright primary colours are what kids like.Ultimately this has shown me not only that I was right about superhero movies over all but now I know where the DC verse is going under the control of the director who made this.And this review will not be liked by the majority as like I've said the furry cute creatures hugged on screen and there was a happy ending for Quill going home.

A lot of factors like the introduction of new characters, concepts and new world building have contributed to the same. In the midst of all these chaos, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 brings a back that feeling of MARVEL which we were always hooked on to (see what I did there ;-))This movie was surrounded by controversies before its release due to the firing and rehiring of the franchise's mastermind director James Gunn. While James Gunn was working on it he was also parallely working on DC projects and he also took up a major role in DC recently. This has had me worried along with some of the MARVEL fans about his commitment towards the project. The way the Guardians get paired with Thor at the end of Avengers: Endgame I expected them to be a major part of the movie Thor Love and Thunder, but that wasn't the case. Even the Guardians' portrayal in that film kind of had us worrying on whether the MARVEL had lost that portrayal. But as soon as I saw the first trailer of GoTG Vol 3, I breathed a sigh of relief. The movie does exactly what it's promised in its trailer, that is, delivering on the emotional quotient along with a high octane fun ride.As seen in the trailer this story majorly involves around Rocket while also diving deep into the inner purpose of the individual characters. Even though the movie is almost 2h and 30 min long it doesn't seem too chaotic or also diverting anywhere from the main plot. There are some emotional flashback episodes which are very endearing to watch but I felt that they could have been placed more effectively. The action and action set pieces are on point and not a pain to watch unlike some of the recent MARVEL ventures. The movie excels in its production design department as always with a great play around colours. The music and background score for GoTG franchise has always been on point and this movie is no different.In case you haven't observed, one of James Gunn's strengths is his characters in movies. He has a very strong backstory to his main characters and for some of his side characters he provides cool, wacky and memorable moments. One can see the shades of Peacemaker and his Suicide Squad reboot in some of the characters' design in this movie. As highlighted before, this story majorly revolves around Rocket and we get to experience some great emotions through Rocket's POV in this film. Kudos to Bradley Cooper yet again for delivering a special performance. This makes you almost forget that the Rocket is voiced by a human, such is the integration. Chris Pratt's role as Starlord kind of starts shakily in this movie but picks up later to and gets a satisfying arc. Drax, Nebula and Mantis' roles are also quote high on emotions. While Groot has some cool moments in the movie, we don't really get to see the innocent fun which we had seen in the first 2 parts. Special mention to Sean Gunn's Kraglin role and performance, especially in the climax (I am not gonna reveal anything but I almost teared up in one of those scenes). I believe there has been a bit of talk about Adam Warlock's portrayal about how that character hasn't been utilized as per the comics. While I feel that role could have been written better, I also understand the restrictions in expanding that role because of movie's length. Zoe Saldana as the 'new Nebula' brings a different perspective and chemistry with the Guardians in this movie. Chukwudi Iwuji's antagonist character as The High Evolutionary is intense and fearsome but somehow misses the charm of a good MARVEL villain.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol.3 is definitely one of MARVEL's very few best post the Avengers: Endgame.

The story is isolated, which gives the illusion of finality.

Though it felt lengthy at 2 hours and 30 minutes, I do not know what they could have cut out. In typical superhero movie fashion, the climactic battle had plenty of explosions to go around.Between the villains and the bickering within the Guardians, there was an excessive amount of yelling in this movie.

Unlike all of the MCU's other films up to that point therse were characters that most audiences weren't familiar with. And some people thought that the idea of a film starring a sentient tree and a talking raccoon travelling in space to save the universe just sounded bizare. Plus it was being directed and written by James Gunn, whose biggest creddits up to that point were Dawn of the Dead and the Scooby-Doo live action films. But cut to less than a decade later, the Guardians are now some of the MCU's most beloved characters and James Gunn is now one of Hollywood's most in demand filmmakers.From the start, Vol. 3 takes a more melancholy approach to the previous installements. It opens with Radiohead's Creep playing as Rocket (Bradley Cooper) tours their headquarters on Knowhere. He and the team are trying to function and continue with their lives, but it's clear the loss of Gamora (Zoe Saldana) has taken its toll on their morale. But all the Guardians are forced back into action once again after the artificially created superbeing Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) flies in and singlehandedly pummels all of the Guardians. They are able to force Warlock to retreat, but Rocket is left in a state of near death. Unable to heal him themselves, the Guardians must fly out on a mission to discover more about Rocket's origins so they can stop themselves from losing another friend.This will lead them to collide against the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji), a cruel scientist who has been experimenting on animals in an attempt to create a \"utopia\". He's another villain with a god complex, but one who is defined by such cruel actions that will make any animal lover demand his execution by the end of the film. His character is also an interesting contradiction. On the one hand he will regularly murder or torture experiments that do not meet his high expectations. But then when an experiment like Rocket does succeed, he becomes so enraged towards them due to their ability to potentially surpass his own intelligence. This unjustified cruelty ends up making him feel somewhere between a vengeful god and a child throwing around his toys in rage.Alongside this Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) remains depressed over Gamora's (Zoe Saldana) death from Infinity War. Plus almost to twist the knife, their mission puts makes Peter work with the alternate timeline version of Gamora who returned from Endgame. She shares none of his memories of their time together and appears almost like an after image further trapping Peter with his grief to remind him of what he has lost. Since this film is primarily Rocket's story, this is treated as more of a side plot and doesn't really get quite enough time. But the chemistry is still strong and they do still use the opportunity to take their relationship in an interesting direction.As for the rest of the Guardians, Karen Gillan's Gamora spreads out into a new role filling the void left by Gamora and shows some impressive character growth from when we saw her in the first Guardians of the Galaxy. Dave Bautista and Pom Klementieff continue to regularly steal scenes and deliver on some of the funniest moments of the film. Gunn still has a lot of fun experimenting with Groots different abilities, my personal favourite being \"Kaiju mode\". Kraglin (Sean Gunn) has a fun little side plot with Cosmo (a telekenetic dog played by Maria Makalova) learning to use his sonic arrow. Will Poulter is also a great new addition as Adam Warlock, though he is underused in a way that makes me hope we see him better utilised in future films. As with any stacked cast some characters do feel like they aren't given anything to do, such as Elizabeth Debecki and Sylvester Stallone. But for the most part Gunn does a great job at giving characters memorable moments even if they do have limited screen time.The film does lose some of it's emotional momentum towards the final third where most of the story beats are already dealt with or pushed to one side as it focuses on the usual final battle to stop the bad guy. But Gunn still does deliver on enough of his signature style to keep the action entertaining. He also may top Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness with some of the most messed up visuals included in a Marvel movie. And overall it's a strong end to both the Guardians trilogy and a good note for Gunn to finish his involvement in the franchise. It contains some increiblde cast chemistry, great visuals and a tone that's able to alternate between both great comedic beats and emotional gut punches.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 3}, "heading": "A Bittersweet Ending to the Trilogy", "date": "2023-05-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9041863", "sentiment score": [0.0163, 0.1071, 0.3342, 0.4782, 0.0642]}, {"content": "I have one big problem with \"Guardians of the Galaxy. Vol. 3.\". The problem is contrast. There is a huge contrast between Rocket's pretty dark and emotional backstory and the rest of the movie. After watching the movie, I am honestly glad that we are not getting more \"GotG\" movies by James Gunn. I like these movies more than almost anything else that the machine called the MCU managed to produce in fifteen years since 2008. Gunn's movies always had more style, energy and passion than the rest of the MCU combined. This is why the first \"GotG\" is perhaps my favorite MCU movie. Even though it's been almost nine years.However, I feel like Gunn is genuinely tired of working with Disney (who isn't?). The guy needs room for his creative vision to breathe and Disney has an alarming tendency to smother any creative vision in order to make movies as formulaic as possible. The MCU formula has been working well for many years. Yeah, their recent movies were not really good, I still can't decide which movie is the worst, \"Thor: Love & Thunder\" or \"Ant-Man 3\". Probably the former. But, despite being mostly disappointing, MCU movies still make huge sums of precious dollars. The only movie that actually flopped was \"Ant-Man 3\" but that's an exception, not the rule. To be fair, however, \"Ant-Man\" didn't really flop, but underperformed. It made less than half a billion in almost three months.I am pretty sure \"GotG 3\" is going to make some good cash especially considering that Disney's favorite country, China, is involved.But let us return to the point that I was trying to make. Gunn doesn't want to make MCU movies anymore. I can't help but compare this new \"GotG\" movie with Gunn's DCEU projects, \"The Suicide Squad\" and \"Peacemaker\" show. Both projects felt like Gunn was having so much fun with them. Both were R rated and allowed themselves more violence and swearing than you would see in a regular comic book movie. Even humor worked much better. In \"GotG\", it is clear how much Gunn was holding himself back. There was blood, but mostly green alien blood that doesn't look like human blood therefore it's okay. Gamora literally slays an alien character in a very gruesome way, but the blood isn't red, so you can bring all your loved ones from your children to your grandparents into the theater, no one's going to get scared or feel discomforted. Disney cares for family-friendly entertainment after all.It is probably for the best that Gunn will be working on remaking the DCEU now after it collapsed miserably. It is kind of bad for the MCU, though, since they lost one of their most creative directors.At the beginning of this video, I was talking about contrast. I thought the movie was okay, overall, nothing really special, nothing of what we haven't seen before. But flashbacks of Rocker's pretty tragic past were absolutely delicious. From beginning to start, Rocket's backstory felt like a more cohesive story than everything else. I genuinely felt for Rocket and all his friends who were used for experiments. This is a big missed opportunity in my opinion. Rocket's story could have been its own movie. If only Disney wasn't so terrified of any experiments, pardon this unintentional pan that slipped into the script somehow. I think \"Rocket: The Movie\" would have been a totally interesting idea. We could learn much more about High Evolutionary and the Counter-Earth that he created. This movie about Rocket could have led us into \"GotG 3\". The movie about Rocket could have also explored body horror elements if that's not too much for Disney. But I think it is.As for \"GotG\", Rocket's backstory takes about half an hour, maybe a little more than half an hour. So, this time could have been comfortably spent on Adam Warlock. Adam Warlock was teased like ten years ago, but actually six, so his appearance in the MCU just had to be epic. And it wasn't satisfying enough unfortunately. I like Will Poulter and I think he was a fairly decent choice for this role. The guy is charismatic enough to be a good villain or an anti-hero depending on how to use him in the story.We don't learn anything about his defect from the movie, we don't know anything about how he was created. Also a strange episode, his so-called \"mother\" probably died on that Counter-Earth planet. We never see her again after the plot moves from the Counter-Earth to Knowhere. We don't see Adam raging over her death either. I suspect that she might've survived somehow and will return again, but I just don't see the point in it, to be honest. She is not that important of a character anyway. I understand why Disney would want to bring Wanda back, she is an Avenger after all, or at least she was.By the way, for a split second, the movie actually made me believe that Rocker would die. But that obviously didn't happen and I'm not really complaining about it. The scene where he realizes that he's a raccoon and accepts himself as Rocket Racoon was really wholesome.As to Adam Warlock, his sudden redemption arc felt very rushed. His whole character arc in general was oversimplified to just this: he was released from his mechanical cocoon or whatever it's called too early, he's got defects, he's not a perfect machine he was made to be, he was not even able to bring Rocket to High Evolutionary and had to retreat from Knowhere. And Warlock suffers from being ridiculed by others for his defects, especially by Evolutionary. However, the movie doesn't focus on Adam's emotional suffering and dilemma. He's clearly not a bad guy, but he was made to obey and do whatever his masters command him to do. There actually could have been an interesting parallel between Adam and Rocket.As I said already, Rocket and his backstory could be a separate movie, while \"GotG\" could focus on Adam Warlock. Or maybe a movie could combine everything. It's two and a half hours after all, pretty comfortable runtime to work with even if your story contains so many different plot elements.Also, is it just me, or is the humor in \"GotG\" movies getting progressively worse? I remember the first movie being cleverly funny, especially compared to other blockbusters. In Volume 3, however, most jokes felt out of place or even embarrassing. I don't know, maybe the humor is worse now or maybe because I have matured since 2014. I should probably try to rewatch older movies sometime to see if I still enjoy them as much as I used to. The answer is probably going to disappoint me.Overall, \"GotG 3\" was a pretty entertaining movie. It had some very emotionally strong moments as well as good performances, especially by Will Poulter whose character was underwhelming, but the actor did his best with what Gunn and the writers prepared for him.CGI had its flaws, though it didn't look nearly as bad as \"Ant-Man 3\" where CGI quality hit rock bottom.My only hope for the future of the MCU is that Disney, after two years, came to realize that they should focus on quality rather than sheer quantity. \"Ant-Man 3\" should serve as a reminder that people get tired of bad content eventually. Despite having Kang the Conqueror, \"Ant-Man 3\" could not bring people to theaters. This is one of the reasons why the next MCU movie, \"Marvels\", was postponed from July to November, as well as other projects, including Disney+ shows. They also moved forward.I recently read an interesting news article that writers of \"DS2\" didn't even watch the ending of \"WandaVision\", so this should probably explain why continuity between those two projects was so poor and why Sam Raimi's movie almost entirely undermined Wanda's character development in the show. Not just viewers, even writers these days cannot catch up with everything that's being released. This is definitely a sign that Disney should slow down and take a deep breath.\"Guardians of the Galaxy. Vol. 3.\", despite its problems, was still a decent end to this current team.

Intelligent, capable, street smart, wise cracking yes, but genius, not sure. But it's this premise that the entire story sits upon.Likewise in this movie we are introduced to the Warlock who feels superfluous to the story and most probably has only been shoehorned in for future instalments or alternative MCU movies.Whilst the movie feels more 'epic' than volumes 1 and 2 it is not as good and does not have a soundtrack anywhere near as good. It's definitely one of the better post Thanos MCU offerings and probably sits just in the upper half of all the MCU but I don't think it's one of the hits.In summary it's a good entry to the MCU and a solid 3rd outing for GOTG but isn't one of the greats.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 4}, "heading": "Good, Epic even but not Great", "date": "2023-05-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9041787", "sentiment score": [0.0013, 0.0202, 0.3567, 0.603, 0.0188]}, {"content": "Firstly, I enjoyed the movie.

Snag is, \"Rocket\" has been laid low after a rather violent visit from \"Warlock\" (Will Poulter) who is working with his mother to apprehend our ursine pal. \"Quill\" (Chris Pratt) and the others have determined to save him, though, and are soon on the trail of his origins and of a special pass key that could reset him and get him back to fighting fitness.

Pratt actually features quite sparingly, and that robbed this of much of it's humour and punchiness.

The sequel was alright but failed to meet the same heights as the original and I had an issue with Drax not getting any proper kick-ass moment. My expectations for Vol. 3 were low and after watching it, I did enjoy it, but it also didn't blow me away. I liked the introduction of Adam Warlock, the fight scenes were all exciting with Drax certainly kicking some ass making up for his lack of action in Gaurdians Vol. 2, the main villain was suitably detestable but also his backstory made sense, there was some impressive CGI work and I was impressed with how graphic and disgusting some characters looked and finally, it was very emotionalat times and even I shed a tear. For all the positives though, I have some issues with it... The characters interactions most of the time felt forced, very few interactions actually felt genuine as the whole film was rushed and moving at such a pace the lines just needed to be delivered as opposed to having feeling behind them. For some people, they enjoy crying at a film, but Gaurdians Vol. 3 really went to town with the amount of lovey-dovey dialouge and crying characters and I personally feel for at least two of them - Nebula and Drax - it sort of ruined their overall characters for me. The jokes didn't always land, some of them were pretty good (like Peter dropping an F-bomb on Nebula - the first F word in an MCU film!) but a majority of the time it was cheap and unintelligent ribbing. Just felt childish more than anything. Groots final line in the film also bothers me... he can only say 3 words, he is only capable of 3 words, so getting him to say something different all of a sudden after 9 years felt like a really cheap way of getting the audience to cry while completely going against everything we know about the character.Final Verdict: An overly teary farewell to a rag-tag group of beloved characters. It is a nice farewell i suppose with some great action and a cool villain, but the story moves at such a pace with so many different characters it can get confusing and some of the dialouge fails to hit its intended mark.

Perhaps because it is his ultimate play in the MCU, James approached the film with a waywardly creative and almost selfishly stylish artistry, whether the greasy meatball planet, the earthly furry neighborhood, or the f-bomb-dropping dialogues. Despite its cartoonish settings, GoG3 is still unquestionably the best Marvel movie since Stage 4 due to its fascinating action sequences and poignant stories. With three major battles larger and larger of scale and intensity, the most mesmerizing combat has to be the hallway infiltration. Flawless choreography and one-take technique for starter, the scene fully showcases not only each Guardians' distinct abilities, but their fluent combos which takes me back to the airport showdown in Civil War. Moreover, the drone-like cinematography captures all aspects of the fight to their totality in swift and ingenious movements, even travelling through a penetrated wound. Jointing these battles are often joking interactions native to the GoG franchise, including out-of-context punchlines and dark humor. In juxtaposition to the laughter is Rocket's recollection, which thoroughly elicits the traumatic backstory of our adored mascot, making him one of my favorite Marvel characters once again. My only complaint for Gunn's peculiarly impeccable directing is the music: indeed, the success of Come And Get Your Love and Mr. Blue Sky is in the gene of GoG, but it doesn't mean that an entire film should be loaded with vintage tunes, and I would still like to have the Guardians' theme as the most prominent part of the music.(Spoilers Ahead!)For its curtain-falling purpose, the movie provides each Guardians with their spotlight moments: Warlock's childly curiosity contrasting his overwhelming prowess, Nebula's self-sacrificial resolve when protecting her family, Mantis' empathetic insight into those around her, Drax's heartwarming fatherhood towards the trapped children, Gamora's arc from inattentive to firmly abiding justice, and Peter's development from infatuated with one's past to pursuing himself... And yet, none of these could amount to James' obvious favorite, Rocket Raccoon. With his private storyline, Rocket's vanity, insecurity, and self-doubt are all reasoned as his tragedy gradually unravels: he habitually thieves and mechanizes because these two skills emancipated him from the most repulsive of hellholes, the place where his hopes were demolished twice (to live in High Evolutionary's utopian society and then to escape with his friends) and heart was impaled thrice (death of Lylla, Teefs, Floor). Bearing physical experiment harsher than Thanos' punishment to his daughter, Rocket could not bear to relive the pain of bereavement, which is why he treats those around him with vitriol and cynicism, pretending to sever oneself from genuine bonds. Another character worthy of discussion is the villain, High Evolutionary, a rare Marvel antagonist since Stage 4 that you can irredeemably hate. With little to none background given, the maniacal scientist was obsessed with inhumane bio-engineering to satiate his sense of godly accomplishment, which, when provoked by his own creation's excellence, sought to demonstrate dominion with the most personal assault. However, he was once again defeated by the animal, disfigured in specific, a near-rated-R, literal face-off. Instead of feeling traumatized, High Evolutionary went the other extreme, becoming even more deranged and motivated, just to \"perfect\" his life's failure. Again, an uncommon antagonist who's meant to be the center of abhorrence, and definitely a better villain to whatever variant of Kang it was in Quantumania.No other Marvel trilogy is as unique, complete, and unforgettable as the Guardians of the Galaxy, and I do not take objections for my statement. Honestly, I'm surprised by James Gunn's creative indefatigability especially in a downhill era for superhero movies, and I'm rather hopeful for his agenda concerning the DCU. For GoG3 in particular, it has been a long time since I felt the lingering taste of a movie upon exiting the theater: the throbbing of heart when rewinding a fight scene, the nasal acidity when sympathizing with a character, and the long exhale of relief after the credits roll when all the original Guardians rest aside each other.

I was really surprised by how emotionally resonant Rocket Raccoon's origin Story is....... the scenes of Rocket 'bonding' and finding genuine compassion from the other intelligent, mutated-misfit, accelerated feral-creatures/ products of the High-Evolutionary's brutal experimentation, was so heartfelt and moving at times it was hard to believe these were CGI and not real breathing-living beings with actual Souls..... the voice and motion-capture actors should be nominated for Academy awards since their expressed emotions appeared so genuine!To balance the poignancy of Rocket's story the other Guardians especially Mantis, Nebula, Drax the Destroyer and Groot have a lot of characteristically idiosyncratic moments that are hilarious and help maintain the balance of 'light & dark' between the intervals of Fantastic action sequences. Another important note is that G of G Vol. 3 has some of the most Creative Starship designs and futuristic (and even psychedelic) technological concepts... some of the most impressive I have ever seen! To Top it all off the side-story of Quill/Star-Lord trying to emotionally re-connect with Gamora keeps the audience guessing all the way thru.... and the progression of that scenario although not what might be expected is still satisfying, nonetheless.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is highly-recommended, if I had one minor reservation it would be that I wish Adam Warlock could have embodied more of the complexity and profound depth of characterization from the original comics (especially the version augmented by Jim Starlin in the mid to late 1970's) but I am most certain Adam Warlock will appear in some future Marvel scenario since he has almost infinite story potential!

The main two comic relief characters here are, of course, m\nMantis and Drax. Unfortunately, nearly every line or action that originates from either of these characters manages to fall flat. Surprisingly, Mantis was wildly annoying at points to me, with her lines feeling more like complaining or whining in the form of a joke rather than actually contributing to one. I acknowledge that it is shallow to complain about a lack of comedic direction in many movies, but I feel it is appropriate in one where the comedy made up much of the soul of both its prior entries.Secondly, I'll address the unfortunate lack of stakes. I can't quite place why, but this movie has a similar issue to Thor: Love and Thunder. Nothing seems to matter in the first place. The best example of this in Thor is Jane's cancer, which seems to be forgotten at many points throughout the movie, and I would equate this to several plot points throughout this movie. First and most obviously, Rocket's condition, which the audience was periodically reminded of through the use of a flashback, before cutting right back to the action. Second, and, I'll add, more annoying than the first for me, was Peter's near death in space. Throughout this sequence, I legitimately believed that we would lose Peter and, at the last moment, something in the movie would genuinely matter. I thought marvel had finally got the guts back to kill off a character, as they recently have not, but Adam Warlock comes in at the last moment to save the day, making the whole thing a joke while he's at it.As a minor complaint, I'll add that I was genuinely excited to see Adam Warlock get involved with the guardians after his teaser in Guardians 2, but we are, unfortunately, left with a character that does nothing but act as a plot device and comic relief, though he is funnier than Drax or Mantis in my opinion.Moving on from complaints, I do have some good things to say. Many have stated that they were uncomfortable with the High Evolutionary's creations, but, in my opinion, this was actually a good thing. It genuinely displayed to the audience that the High Evolutionary is a psychopath, which was further accentuated by Chukwudi Iwuji's performance, which, in my opinion, was the best of the movie. His presence, actions, and creations make me uncomfortable, and I was all for it. I'll also say that the final fight against the High Evolutionary felt like briefly getting the old guardians back again, and it was perfectly triumphant and glorious. The final few scenes also finally added meaning to this movie in regards to the greater MCU, with the disbanding of the guardians and Peter's return to his grandfather acting as welcome and effective closure.Ultimately, this movie was quite disappointing for me. While not nearly as bad as Doctor Strange 2 or Thor 4, it's highs were barely above the lows of Black Panther 2, and I give it a 6/10.", "rating": 6, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 4}, "heading": "Disappointing, yet somehow better than much of Marvel's recent offerings", "date": "2023-05-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9040689", "sentiment score": [0.1664, 0.4974, 0.2153, 0.097, 0.024]}, {"content": "In James Gunn's final farewell from Marvel, we have Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3. The Guardians now in possession of Knowhere are in the process of rebuilding the Colney following Thanos's attack. Quill's still mourning the loss of Gamora and failing to impress the variety picked up in Endgame. Matters only get worse when all of a sudden Adam Warlock(Will Poulter) shows up to destroy the guardian and in the process, Rocket is mortally wounded and is put on Life support. So now the Guardians have to set out and the means to save him all wrapped in the possession of the mysterious High Evolutionary. In many ways, Guardians 3 set out what it tends to do in what's meant to be a farewell to not only the director but also these characters that we've gotten to know over several films. While there's still humor and charm to be found in this film It stands out from past several films going for a more serious tone. The first half of the film is far slower paced it's more dialogue-driven as imposes actions and in many ways, it works, and in many ways, it doesn't. With subplots that don't overall mean much to moments that do feel like bloat that just expands the film's runtime. This is understandable given they wanted everybody to get their fair amount of screen time, but some moments could have been trimmed down in favor of giving more focus to other things such as Starlord and Gamora. Overall the theme of family, loss, and moving on emotional investment in the relation of the team. The cast as a whole for the most part a great all the guardians are delivered well the humor is rather mixed in this film when it does happen not every joke don't hits as in previous films. Most of the funny lines are Delivered by Drax. Whereas many from Mantis just come off as forced. Groot is Groot he's fine, but the design they give him just looks terrible compared to how he looks in the first. Star lord they set up a subplot with him, but their address in small moments then never addressed again. Him being a Celestial his blunder with Thanos in the first half he just acts like a jerk and halfway through he;'s more the character we knew in the other films. As for the relationship between him and Gamora with little she has to do with the Story Zoe Saldana does give a great delivery, but when it comes to the overall situation between her and Quill. Rocket, of course, is the center point of the story the drive to push all of them to show their love and admiration for each other as sort of the defauctonional family they are. Most of his scenes are done through flashbacks and overall I enjoyed them. Rocket was always the member we knew the least about and had just hinted to go off. It's here that finally shows the answers and where the more serious aspect of the film derives from. It's darker, depressing, and violent. The High Evolutionary sells all of these points. It was quite shocking that they were able to make this villain work the way they did. He's a welcome addition to what's been missing past Endgame. He's a villain a Fanatic geneticist who's obsessed with making the perfect lifeform. Doesn't care about any of his creations, or any of the despicable actions he commits. He's not misunderstood, he wasn't wronged in his past He was just psycho with a God Complex, and the movie does well in making you hate him. The worst aspect starts with Adam Warlock. It's been stated numerous times that it's too late to bring this character into these films. Set up at the end of the second film and did nothing with him for infinity war and Endgame where everybody stated he should have been with Thanos. Now we're finally giving him in the film and he sucks. He's reduced to nothing more than a puppet and is a dumb mama's boy who connects to overall nothing in the grand scheme of things. The second is the soundtrack. The soundtrack in these films has always been some of the best highlights. Whereas a lot of films rely on Licensed songs just for cheap grabs. The songs in guardians' films always fit setting the tone and pace of the action. They all for the most part fitted with the scenes they were assigned to. Here personally I don't remember a single song from this. It just felt like Gunn was just going all out same with the camera shots and spins. The songs are just thrown in everywhere just for the sake of noise.

James Gunn did a great job on ending GOTG considering he will move onto DC. The acting by everyone was amazing that makes the viewer feels all type of emotions from laughter to sadness. The cinematography is visually stunning, from the CGI and special effects, that makes you feel that you were in another universe. Lastly, the action was great from the Guardians that made the viewer want more fights. Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy vol. 3 is great with its acting, cinematography, action, and the story.

One thing i did not like though, is i feel they could of done more with Gamora and Quill, as i feel they didn't have as much screen time together in the film as they should. But that's just me. They DID \"change\" as the movie progresses though, starting with Gamora hating Quill, even pushing him against a wall in his ship. To them fighting along side each other in what i and most of the marvel community would say is one of the best fight scenes in cinematic history..well atleast marvel history. (the hallway fight scene). All the way to having a heart wrenching talk in the end, where Peter accepts that Gamora will never feel the same about him like he still does, and how they did in the last (previous) films.

That's why I stepped in.\" I have to admit, this is one of THE best lines ever spoken by a supervillain - it concisely captures their whole reason for being. (Seems like that would have been a perfect for Thanos to say.) Oddly though, for once there's no real backstory for the High Evolutionary, as there usually is for Marvel villains, but that might have been just too much material. Quite appropriately, all the attention is really on our scruffy, argumentative, and lovable heros, the Guardians.I liked that all of them, this time around, get their well deserved fair share of screen time, and if doing that means sitting through a pretty long movie, then fine. Mantis and Nebula in particular are better characters than they were before, Quill and Gamora and Drax are as good as ever, and the choice to make Rocket and his very extended backstory the mainspring of the plot was clever -- and by the end, it carried real weight. Rocket is now elevated to a tragic, substantial figure at practically the same level as Spider-Man, and that's saying a lot.The whole Guardians series owes director James Gunn bigtime, and it's a shame to see him move on (but I'm looking forward to seeing what he'll be able to do over at DC). He set in motion a group of characters that really worked, and this 3rd instalment builds very effectively on top of its predecessors. Going in to the theater I knew what I expected out of them, but we got more than that. That's a big compliment.At the same time, what was done with Warlock and High Evolutionary was kind of odd, in the end. I was disappointed that Warlock especially was kind of trivialized. He's capable of becoming a major character if they would just follow the path set out in the original comics.

Desperate to save their friend, the other Guardian's try and track down the lab where his body was experimented on, which ultimately leads them to The High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji) an unfeeling genetic scientist hell bent on creating the perfect society and desperate for the chance to dissect the brain of Rocket, his most successful experiment. To access his facilities, Nebula (Karen Gillen) reaches out to Gamora (Zoe Saldana) for specialist help.Yes, I cried at the end. Not at any one particular aspect of the finish particularly, but more a sort of low-level emotional moments that tie up what feels like the end of a large section of the MCU, that ebbed and flowed as the perfect song was chosen, or the perfect reunion happens. There are two big levels of pain that GOTG3 is tasked with dealing with. Rockets trauma and survivors' guilt about the time he was experimented on, and Quill's inability to accept that his Gamora has gone, and the one still walking about doesn't love him. There were funny moments too, I should say, it's not one long cavalcade of misery.What it also is, is phenomenally good looking. I know that Feige has said that they're going to refocus on fewer/better films and one area where they can look to improve is the special effects, but for whatever reason this film, with several all-CGI characters, has entirely avoided that issue. I don't know if it's that Gunn is a stronger minded director than others, and refused the compromises, but it's certainly worth it.It's not, perhaps quite at the level of \"Infinity War\" or \"No Way Home\". It doesn't have fan servicing ability that either of those have - but it's a surprisingly dark and mature film and I enjoyed it a lot.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 5}, "heading": "Since You Been Gone", "date": "2023-05-07T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9039950", "sentiment score": [0.0147, 0.155, 0.4564, 0.3439, 0.0301]}, {"content": "When it arrived nine years ago, James Gunn's GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY instantly became one the most popular films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The premise of a ragtag gang of super powered beings coming together and becoming reluctant heroes really struck a chord with comic fans and even those who were casual super hero film followers. The film had distinctive characters, and a lot of humor driven by the uniqueness of these heroes and their sharp edged personalities which were vividly rendered by some perfect casting choices. And a great soundtrack filled some of the best singles of the '70s was an added bonus. There had been some banger comic book films before GOTG, THE DARK KNIGHT and CAPTAIN AMERICA: WINTER SOLDIER being among the best, but GUARDIANS had a real sense of fun, and a lot of heart. I think this was mainly due to director and writer Gunn, who took a group of heroes that many die hard Marvel fans would have had a hard time placing in the comic universe and making them superstars. The follow up, subtitled Vol. 2, fell short of the bar set by the original, but it still had a lot going for it. I didn't like the way they used Kurt Russell (they didn't give him a scene with Sylvester Stallone so we could have had a TANGO AND CASH reunion), but they did allow Michael Rooker's Yondu to shine.Now, six years after the last installment in the franchise, we finally get Volume 3. Peter Quill is mourning the loss of Gamora, and drinking too much, while the rest of the Guardians seem to be in a similar funk as being heroes in the post ENDGAME MCU has taken a toll. This torpor comes to an abrupt end when they are attacked by Adam Warlock, a minion of The High Evolutionary, who is revealed to be Rocket Raccoon's creator, and now wants him back, or to be more precise, wants his evolved brain back. Warlock is driven off temporarily, but Rocket is left near death. His team mates must now find a way to save him, and in the process, confront The High Evolutionary and his plan to build a counter-Earth by constantly experimenting on lower life forms to create a \"perfect\" race. Think of The Planet of Dr. Moreau.At two and a half hours, there's a lot going on in GOTG Vol. 3, including Peter's attempt to jump start a romance with an alternate universe version of Gamora who doesn't remember him. But the heart of the film is Rocket's story, or more to the point, his back story, which is revealed in flashbacks. Animal experimentation and vivisection are featured prominently, along with the genocide of The High Evolutionary's failed experiments. This is a dark turn, one tinged with true sadness as we understand Rocket's pain and loss. I think this tricky change in tone works, mainly because James Gunn is a very good director of this kind of material, and he has done the work necessary to earn a proper payoff. Gunn also stages some good action scenes, especially a confrontation in a hallway at The High Evolutionary's HQ between an army of his minions and the Guardians where the latter cut loose in a way that reminds us of why they are such a lethal force to deal with when the chips are down. There's good use of CGI to create a cosmic level comic story, including some neat looking monsters, even if other worlds like Knowhere are starting to have an awfully familiar look to them. Though much of the attention is on Rocket and Peter, Drax, Mantis, Nebula, and Groot all have their moments that remind us why they are fan favorites. One of the most important elements in any comic adaptation is the villain, and thankfully Chukudi Iwuji's High Evolutionary goes above and beyond. His bad guy is an old style megalomaniac mad scientist right out of a horror film with no effort to make him \"relatable.\" And the reveal of his final appearance, when we see the damage Rocket has done to his face, is truly a horror moment; one of the reasons why GOTG Vol. 3 may not be suitable for younger kids. Another thing I liked about this installment in the franchise is that it is pretty much free of any social or political agenda, something that can't be said about other recent MCU films. It's refreshing that the fate of the universe doesn't depend on a teenage girl for once. Gamora, Nebula, and Mantis, are bad ass female characters, but they are also allowed to be flawed and funny.GOTG Vol. 3 does have its faults. My biggest gripe is the way they used the character of Adam Warlock, who is a big heavy hitter in the Marvel comic universe, but he could have easily been cut out of this story entirely and replaced with a minor villain. As I said, some of the CGI does not impress that much anymore, and it is overlong, though the pacing makes up for it. All in all, I did not walk out of this final Guardians film with any sense of disappointment, something I can't say for the last three MCU films-THOR: LOVE AND THUNDER, WAKANDA FOREVER, and QUANTAMANIA. That I chalk up to James Gunn, who is departing for the DCEU, where hopefully his talents will be put to use reviving Superman, Batman, and a whole host of other iconic superheroes. But he leaves behind a sputtering MCU, which appears to be going nowhere from a lack of direction and bad writing. All of this squandering the good will of many diehard fans like myself. Though GOTG Vol. 3 is promoted as the \"last ride\" of the Guardians, the mid credits and final credit scenes promise their return. I'd be up for a project that centered on Will Poulter's Adam Warlock, one that did justice to Jim Starlin's creation, but I'm not so sure I want to see Chris Pratt, Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldana, Karan Gillan, Pom Klementieff, Sean Gunn, the voice work of Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel return in their super hero alter egos without James Gunn at the helm. Maybe the three GOTG films should be left to stand alone as one of the strongest pillars of the MCU, but if there is more money to be squeezed out of it by Disney/Marvel, then sadly, that is what will probably happen.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 5, "votes": 9}, "heading": "I didn't walk away disappointed like some other recent MCU films.", "date": "2023-05-07T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9039933", "sentiment score": [0.009, 0.0487, 0.1461, 0.5923, 0.204]}, {"content": "This film is joyless and boring.

To be honest, Marvel lately has left me feeling dissatisfied and generally quite unhappy, but this movie could not be further from those emotions and is everything that made me care about the franchise in the first place. This movie is such a wonderful and perfect ending to the adventures that the guardians have been on in their previous films, and is the best thing to come from Marvel since phase 3 in my opinion.The wonderful thing about this film is how it highlights each of the guardian's strengths and weaknesses, and how they work together as a perfect family unit. Undoubtedly though the movie belongs to Rocket, this is his film and he is the star of the show. The glimpses at his backstory are heart-breaking and emotional and give added meaning to every single decision that he has made so far on screen. The CGI is amazingly done, and at times is a little bit too realistic and harrowing. The clips with his animal friends and their cybernetic enhancements that are scattered throughout the film verge on being far too uncomfortable, but are then mixed in with typical guardians humour to make everything feel that little bit more okay. It is worth noting that the themes of animal abuse and torture are strong, and even just the designs of his friends (especially Floor) are quite uncomfortable to see. There are definitely moments that were just a little bit too much, but these scenes were mostly short and the film wouldn't have hit the same if they'd been removed. It's just something to be aware of if this is something that would upset you, and I'd definitely not suggest this movie to children. If I'd have seen it when I was younger, I don't think I would've coped all that well.The other guardians shine too. We see far more emotion from Nebula than in previous movies, due to her closeness with Rocket after spending the 5 years of the blip with him. Karen's acting is phenomenal. The fight scene that takes place set to No Sleep Till Brooklyn does a fantastic job of individually giving each member of the team a moment to stand out while also showing how they all bounce off each other. Mantis was far stronger and closer to her comic book counterpart in this movie, which I loved.The ending is bittersweet and will be emotional for anyone who loves these characters, but every member of the team had a very fulfilling ending that works perfectly for them and aligns with their development and hopes that are clear from the first movie.As always, the soundtrack was outstanding and every song was used effectively.The best thing Marvel has done in a long time, a perfect end to the trilogy.

Although Guardians 3 is not a bad movie per se, it is definetly the worst of the three.All the sillyness and light hearted jokes of the first two installments seemed just forced: The characters used to argue a lot in the previous movies too, but here the arguments seem more serious and sometimes the friendship actually looks damaged. Rocket gets the spotlight, but most of the background story is simply too dark. I wanted to watch the movie with my kids, but this is not a kids movie. The first two were kind of violent too, but not in this grim, dark and desperate way.Nebula does not seem to fit in the crew, Drax does not do much at all, Groot seems strangely hallow and 'unfinished', only Starlord and Gomorra have a somewhat interesting tension. Both the adult groot and baby groot from 1 and 2 had something going on, young Groot here seems to lack any personality. The writers did not know how to use this character. The actors sometimes played as if it was the last day before summer vacation - just get it done and forget about it.I always liked the family and friendship aspect of the first two, because it was somewhat ridiculed by the characters themselfs (\"5 idiots standing in a circle\" from the first, or \"that unsaid thing\" between Gomorra and Starlord or Drax being gentle to Baby-Groot at the end of part 2), but here it's not embedded in the actions anymore. It has to be said, over and over again.For a Grand Finale it often feels too complex, too empty and too forced. Was it a bad movie - no, probably not, but it was for sure not up there with the other two. I will probably re-watch it in a couple of years, hopefully I like it more then.

Rocket's backstory is extremely well done. It maintains a somber tone throughout and is never undermined by quippy Marvel jokes. You can feel the fear and tension in those scenes and they are really great to watch. The humor was pretty good, especially Dave Bautista's Drax. His comedic timing was near perfect. There were also a lot of visual gags and slapstick that really made me chuckle to myself in the theater. There was still the Marvel quippy humor, as Guardians is really the origin of that meme, but it wasn't near as tone deaf as what we saw in Thor: Love and Thunder. The movie lets it's more heavy hitting moments with Rocket lie, which I really appreciated coming from a Marvel film. Gamora's interactions with the Guardians were also handled very well, which honestly surprised me. The movie took a surprisingly mature approach to broken relationships and had a good arc for Star Lord regarding his relationships with others. However, the highlight of the movie is definitely the action and the set pieces. There's a beautifully choreographed hallway scene where all the Guardians get to show off with an awesome fish eye lens POV slow motion continuous shot. It was easily the highlight of the film for me.Now, for the bad, or at least the mediocre. The Grand Evolutionary was pretty lackluster as a villain. He was barely in the movie and at the end the battle with him is pretty much one sided. Since he was more of a practical obstacle, than a necessary part of the themes the story was exploring, this was fine. However, it could have been better if there was a more focused villain, or perhaps one that challenged the way the Guardians think instead of thematic conflict being between only the Guardians themselves. My only gripe with the Rocket backstory is that we don't see a lot of him dealing with his past in the present, which is honestly a real shame. Adam Warlock definitely won't be everyone's piece of cake, since he was sidelined for most of the movie. However, I didn't mind this as much, because the parts that he was in, he did well. A few of the running jokes didn't quite land for me, but a lot of them did, so that's forgiven. On a more general note, my largest criticism is that the movie is a bit unfocused, since it is juggling so many characters at once. A few arcs had to be played off as gags because there wasn't enough time to really fill them out. A lot of character resolutions were structured as them \"realizing\" something and saying it out loud to a group of guardians. However, this wasn't super atrocious. If anything, the movie could have benefitted from being longer or from having cut a few characters out. It was pretty good, but it had the capacity to be very good or even great. I still had a great time though.All in all, the movie was pretty good, which honestly surprised me given Marvel's recent track record. It's a solid 8/10 from me.

Action is okay, highlighted by a hallway action scene that is not new, but still fresh. Any other positives are riddled with negatives, such as the funniest part being at the expense of a smart character having a really dumb moment. The script treats its audience as if we were dumb, as does its characters who repeatedly say and act in ways that are counter to their goal. Multiple times we are lead to believe that a character is about to die or is dead, only for them to be totally okay. One character has Aunt May No away Home moment when they get smashed into at extreme velocity by someone else. Smashed through a city. And gets up wiping the dust off while making a joke. The acting is atrocious. Characters are forgotten for super long periods of time or disappear entirely. There's a consistent tonality of a weak plot peppered with plot holes. Characters seem to randomly know the master plan and act accordingly with amazing precision only for dramatic tension to be brought about by the dumb characters.The overwhelming high praise that the movie has received along with how bad it is, has prompted a more negative view of the film.

While the cast certainly gave it their all, and Gunn's creativity can be seen in spurts throughout the film, it's not enough to redeem it in the end - even the vintage soundtrack that we've come to love from the past two movies felt out of place in half the scenes, as if it were thrown together randomly. On one end, you have the typical Disney quips that fall completely flat, and on the other you've got over the top gore for sheer shock value. While this movie will tug on your heart strings, most of it is through the emotional manipulation of \"cute animals in danger\". It's clear that Disney is too afraid to take any serious risks. Case and Point: At some point in the film, every single individual guardian brushes with death, but Disney is too afraid to follow through with actually killing off a character.

This is the most emotional MARVEL film and the first time I cried during an MCU film. Some of the scenes in Rocket's flashbacks are heartbreaking and Bradley Cooper really does a great job with Rocket Racoon. Some animal owners may fell quite triggered by some of the scenes here and I understand that.One of the reasons of that was the High Evolutionary. He is the worst MARVEL villain and I hate him, in a good way. He is in my top three MCU villains. Speaking of villains, I loved Adam Warlock in the film. Although, he did get barely any screen time, and as the movie went on, I kind of forgot he was there.

We all know from Daredevil MARVEL delivers great hallway scenes. How James Gunn directed some of the shots was really fun.In the end of the film, I was surprised none of the main Guardians members died. The way they were marketing the film made me think that this was one last ride. Drax was shot twice, on the ground, Mantis was crying and then he comes back the next scene?Peter Quill freezing would have been of been a fitting end to the character, and although Adam gets a redemption ark, it just feels like no point. I think it should of ended with the Guardians helping Rocket defeat the High Evolutionary and they would go for one last ride in the forever sky, before the ship blows up killing them all.A thing I was wondering in the marketing leading up to this film was how were they going to handle Peter and Gamora's relationship.

Phase 5 had an underwhelming start with Ant man who chose to introduce \"the big bad\" Kang, only to seemingly kill him off straight away, in order to introduce a load more Kangs as the actual bad guys or something (???) but I was cautiously optimistic that with James Gunn in charge of the team he has directed from the start, we may get back to the old standard, and I'm happy to report that it WAS!The whole cast puts in a fantastic performance with it feeling more like an ensemble movie rather than star lord, and the others. I won't run through the whole plot as I'll save that for for your viewing pleasure, but the film centres around the backstory of Rocket, which I've seen a few reviews complaining about the content of this as it centres around animal cruelty, however if you know anything about the character, or indeed have watched ANY other of the previous guardians movies, you will know Rocket has a horrific origin so I'm unsure of the complaints. (Also speaking of dumb complaints - I've read reviews complaining that all the team does all movie is argue and fall out with eachother... that's what happens in EVERY guardians film?! They fallout, but make up and succeed together, like the family they are.) Anyway back to the story, the flashbacks tell how he was experimented on by the high evolutionary in his quest to create a perfect race while the team rush to save his life after an encounter with Adam Warlock. This would be where my first down point of the film comes, purely as I felt the character was somewhat of a letdown and didn't really have a place in the plot and is just a \"hired gun\" character. Will Poulter does well with it, but there is no screen presence of the character we know from the comics and is just more of a man-child in the film - though I will say this is explained in the film. The soundtrack is cracking, the set pieces are great, and there are several great action scenes, one in particular at the end where every team member gets to show their skills off. The writing is also great again with everyone having some good heartfelt dialogue at times, and also lots of comedic moments, with Dave Bautista being on form with some hilarious one liners throughout the film (take note Taiko - THIS is how you do humour...) The high evolutionary is a great villain, and does so without being one who shows much of a physical threat, I thought Chukwudi Iwuji's performance was maniacal, unhinged and imposing, and basically had more of a threat than Kang did.Overall this was a fantastic film but somewhat bittersweet that it's the end of the story for this team, I would love a fourth film with these again but the ending pretty much confirms this is it for them.With regards to the future MCU as with most guardians films, it doesn't really fit in to an overall narrative for the MCU, though let's me honest, there hasn't really been one since endgame. So it worries me that it's on to the Marvels movie, one which I don't anyone is really looking to seeing, to bring the narrative back and give us some kind of overall plot that we are headed to.

Also loved the little bit of Poulter's character that we saw, and look forward to seeing more.

From the subdued and subtle opening to the more bombastic and high-octane action set-pieces, writer and director James Gunn knows how to put his own unique stamp on the tired genre of super hero films - so much so that \"Guardians 3\" doesn't even feel like a super hero movie, and that's a good thing. More of a somber drama than the whimsical space-adventure of the previous two films, this third, and seemingly final, entry plays things very straight, telling an emotional story that may have you fighting back tears. Gunn has a clear care for both the source material and the story he's trying to tell, and it's evident; this is, without a doubt, a James Gunn movie through and through. The problem with that, for me, is that - and I mean this with the utmost respect - James Gunn is a fan of the bizarre and macabre, and I feel as if \"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3\" was just a bit too bizarre and macabre for my taste.I saw this movie twice in order to best solidify my thoughts on it because, after my first viewing, I honestly left the theatre confused; and honestly, even after second viewing I still find myself conflicted. On one hand, the movie works as a fitting conclusion to the trilogy, filled with emotion and beautiful characterization, with themes of family and friendship ringing true throughout the entire running time. Additionally, the action, the CGI, it all looks stunning, all of it elevated by the story's dramatic heft; not since Endgame has an MCU film been this emotionally resonant. I also don't even need to mention the soundtrack, because you already know it's going to be amazing, and it is - I was tapping my foot constantly throughout the film. On the other hand, however, despite all of the good this movie contains, I'd be lying if I said I enjoyed watching it because, well, I really didn't.While \"Guardians 3\" stands out from the MCU pack, it does so to the detriment of my personal viewing experience. To put it frankly, I found this movie disturbing. Without specific spoilers, the movie deals heavily with animal cruelty, a theme that I didn't necessarily realize I had a problem with until I watched this movie and was privy to Frankenstein-esque animals that look more like something out of a horror film than they do a kids super hero movie. And it's not so much their appearance that's the problem, but rather the mental images that will flicker in your mind as you imagine what said animals had to go through to look the way they do. The film is surprisingly graphic, and I can imagine many children leaving the theatre traumatized based on this aspect alone - hell, I'm an adult, and I found myself feeling queasy and disgusted, with the images sticking with me long after the credits rolled.So, it'll be up to you if the pros outweigh the cons when it comes to \"Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3.\" Maybe you'll find yourself uplifted by the undeniable positivity the movie does have, or maybe the tone is a fitting change of pace for you when compared to recent super hero films. While I am looking forward to seeing this film again strictly for its soundtrack (it really is that good), ultimately the depictions of animal cruelty proved to be too disturbing for me to fully enjoy the film.", "rating": 5, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 6, "votes": 15}, "heading": "Cruel, dark, and disturbing - a welcome change of pace, or a detriment to the film?", "date": "2023-05-07T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9038017", "sentiment score": [0.0057, 0.0447, 0.2195, 0.652, 0.0781]}, {"content": "I had a lot of fun at the cinema.

I'm also just not really into Marvel's style of camp and its commitment to emulating (homaging?) 60s style sci-fi television.

There ended up being absolutely no stakes in this movie at all. I just don't understand how they could've done that.

Bradley Cooper nailed the voice acting and the arc came full circle with a proper payoff.

Adam Warlock was a welcome if somewhat underexplored addition to the cast, and a wide variety of imaginative and frequently grizzly selection of supporting characters were generally a bonus.In fact it was the Guardians themselves who disappointed. Rocket and Star-Lord were largely humourless throughout. The three female guardians, including - strangely - Mantis, melded into the same universally angry, shouty character.

The recent run of films and series from this franchise have been lackluster at best, so it was paramount for those in charge to right the ship and fast.Boy, did Gunn and company deliver. While certainly not a perfect film, Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume Three captures the essence of what made early MCU films, including the first two Guardians films, so special. This film is successful in delivering an energetic, entertaining, and satisfying conclusion to this trilogy of films.It's impossible to talk favorite MCU characters without mentioning a number of Guardians, and an integral factor to that are the acting performances and the chemistry between cast members. Everyone is solid, nailing both comedic beats and emotional moments. The execution of these two emotions is a crucial part to why this film works so well. Though, I must give special kudos to Bradley Cooper for Rocket, Karen Gillan as Nebula, and Zoe Saldana as Gamora. Saldana was tasked with playing a different version of Gamora than we've seen from her before; a more hostile, aggressive version; and she absolutely killed it. She's distinctly different from her other appearances but maintains her likability. The familiarity and attachment we have to these characters is wholly what grants the film to be the funniest, darkest, saddest, most triumphant MCU project since Endgame.Another major strength of the film is Rocket's story. He is essentially the main character of this film, as we learn through flashbacks about his gruesome and tragic backstory and his relation to the High Evolutionary, the main antagonist for the film. Every emotion Gunn and co. Tried to capture in these flashback scenes. They were disturbing and tragic, while able to sneak in moments of wholesome levity and optimism. I continue to say, I was very impressed with their ability to balance both emotional ranges.I loved James Gunn's direction in this film. His work overall is unique and energetic in a way that doesn't get irritating, like with Taika Waititi's recent track record. It's quirky and distinct, but not just for the sake of being those things. He also didn't make his heroes a parody of themselves, which I appreciate. The action direction and choreography, to play off of that, was nothing short of awesome. The long take in the corridor will be a favorite for a while, but it was presented in an interesting way throughout the film, and utilizing these characters to be the team that they are in these sequences is just icing on the cake. Again, chemistry is so important to buy stuff like this.Much like the bond of the characters on screen, it's quite apparent that the relationship among cast and crew members is mighty, with some cast members wanting to work with Gunn in future projects, i.e. The DC universe.Guardians Three is also more brutal than I expected it to be. There are a multitude of disturbing and grotesque shots in the film, but I thought they worked seamlessly with the narrative. I also liked the High Evolutionary for most of the film. His obsession and sinister nature works as a foil to the optimistic and cheerful Rocket and friends in the flashback sequences.I can rave all day about this film, but avoiding my gripes would be disingenuous. The opening meandered a bit and subtly provided an opportunity for other aspects of characters to be explored, but they were merely shrugged off once the main conflict was introduced. The execution of Adam Warlock was underwhelming as well, and felt like a real missed opportunity. It felt like he didn't belong in this narrative, and getting what we got from him after a six year wait felt like they just needed to find a way to include him and make him a part of the plot. More or less, he became the \"introduce the plot, then become comic relief\" character. Will Poulter was fun as the character, though.In the shlock of mediocre to garbage MCU projects over the past couple of years, releasing a film like Guardians of the Galaxy: Volume Three is a welcome return to form, even if it's for this one film alone. Marvel essentially let their best director walk for the competition, and that can't help but make me more intrigued by future DC films going forward. 9/10P. S.

Not special, just the continuation of a formula.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 is mostly what made Marvel films so popular. Entertaining action films but with enough heart and characters that we care about to make them memorable. When Guardians Vol. 1 came out no one new that it would become as popular as it did. It was a very funny, energetic film that gained a great following. Vol.2 wasnt as good but the cast and director James Gunn and the willing cast made it entertaining. With Vol.3 we have supposedly the last Guardians film. And after seeing it it just might be better than even rblhe first one. Everyone is back, including director Gunn. Everyone knows that now he will be in charge of the DC universe and if he can bring his energy to those films it would be a good thing.The focus of this film is Rocket. He has been captured and on the verge of death so his friends go to save him. The film focuses veryuch on Rocket's origin story. The villain this time is the High Evolutionary. A highly intelligent being that wants to create the perfect society. He experiments on animals but destroys them as soon as they don't meet his perfect standards. Rocket was one of his experiments. He showed great intelligence. He was able to escape and become a Guardian but High Evolutionary wants to study his brain so that he could again, create the perfect beings for his next society.All of the cast is really good.

Chukwudi Iwuji is terribly scary as THE HIGH EVOLUTIONARY who is so single-minded in his mission that living beings - and planets - are expendable.

I love James Gunn's style and sense of direction. His anarchistic humor and sense of sensitivity for this group of misfits always worked for me. This film balances out the comedy, drama, and action probably the best out of its trilogy. I love how in each installment, these characters really grow and have their own arcs. Nothing really returns to the status quo for these guys and no more is that ever evident then in this movie.The action is the best it's ever been, aside from one scene that I'll get to later. I love the found family dynamic at play here, even more so now that the gang are all very much familiar with each other. The chemistry is stellar owing in part because of the stellar cast.I will say though, despite the fact that the villain is an interesting play on the classic mad scientist archetype, he isn't all that interesting. Still one of the MCU's better villains, but that's honestly not saying much. The final battle with him honestly was disappointing to me, though it did give plenty of catharsis for our heroes so it evens out a guess. Well at least the effects departments got really creative with his creations.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a fantastic summer blockbuster! One of the best MCU movies yet!

It ranks within the higher tier films like the first IRON MAN, the CAPTAIN AMERICA sequels, INFINITY WAR and the first AVENGERS. It felt like STAR WARS without it being STAR WARS as Gunn eloquently put it. I thought VOL. 2 was a massive \"recycled\" step backwards with an overload of humor. Yondu is the only thing worthy about VOL.2So I walked into this one with some low expectations due to how I felt about VOL. 2 and the quality of MCU films as of late. While it is a step above VOL. 2, I did feel like the film yanked along the way with so many moments that just tried way too hard to make me feel emotional.This is probably a me thing, but because I'm not particularly an animal lover, I felt Rocket's backstory tried too hard to make me feel sad. It did provide a lot of depth for him and Bradley Cooper does a great job voicing him. I would argue this is probably is his best outing as Rocket so far.In contrast though, respect to Gunn for including animal cruelty and child abduction. I loved that he went there and played around in that dark arena. I absolutely respect the move because I love when the MCU makes an effort to include mature themes and dark elements from time to time. Humor was more tame compared to VOL. 2 and I didn't particularly mind it this time around. Some of the jokes landed and I did find myself chuckling once or twice.Pratt's Star-Lord feels more evolved and not the same go-lucky/quipping thief, and of course he wouldn't as he's mourning the loss of his girlfriend, but there is another version of her that isn't the version he fell in love with. Another move I respect was that he and Gamora did not get back together. It felt real and made bigger impact mirroring the fact that this iteration of the Guardians is finished. Saldana does a good job playing Gamora a bit more savage and merciless.Bautista has good chemistry with Klementieff as shown in the Holiday Special and I'm happy Bautista got more action sequences showcasing Drax's strength. Groot is used to good effect as well. Not as awesome as the first Groot but way better than baby/teenage Groot. Kraglin played by Gunn's brother Sean and Cosmo voiced by Maria Bakalova are also involved in a meaningful way. Again kudos to James Gunn for this juggling act.Will Poulter's Adam Warlock I felt got the short end of the stick. I thought he could have been utilized a little bit better, but I did quite like his portrayal. As for Chukwudi Iwuji, he does a great job being unhinged as the High Evolutionary. Very threatening, menacing and just all out crazy.I did feel the length. I felt the whole part at Orgoscope was unnecessary and dragged the film. I felt they could have just went straight to the High Evolutionary. Again, while the flashbacks provided some depth for Rocket, it felt choppy to me primarily because I'm trying to engage with the overall plot in motion and then I'm watching something where I felt tried too hard to make me care. Rocket in \"animal heaven\" reunited with his friends also felt extremely cheesy. Another example of that was when the film plays with the idea of Star-Lord dying at the end. What bothered me about that was how does he not have his helmet and his jetpack on his ankles that he's known for having? He's flown in space before and yeah I know he was asked to not have weapons in the High Evolutionary's HQ, but he gave his blasters to Groot who hid a bunch of guns, he couldn't have given him his ankle jetpacks or his helmet? This is why I felt like the film is deliberately trying to make me feel emotional.Also this is a minor, comic-book geek nitpick that doesn't really effect the film, but the visual development team gave them the classic comic-book accurate blue and red striped suits and they couldn't give Star-Lord his mask with the accurate helmet from the comics? LOL.Anyways, I respected the darker themes, I respected that if felt like the end with a whole new team assembled and there were some fine performances, but it felt long and wasn't particularly subtle at tugging my heart strings.5/10.", "rating": 5, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 17, "votes": 41}, "heading": "Slight improvement upon Vol. 2, Vol. 1 still the best.", "date": "2023-05-06T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9036759", "sentiment score": [0.0161, 0.1197, 0.3141, 0.475, 0.0751]}, {"content": "Guardians of the Galaxy 3 is an clearly incredible movie this is sure to satisfaction fans of the previous films and newcomers alike.

Chris Pratt yet again shines as the lovable rogue Star-Lord, whilst Zoe Saldana brings a fierce intensity to her function as Gamora.

I really liked this choice, Rocket's backstory has a lot of substance and the flashbacks to how he was moulded into who he became were some of my favourite scenes in the movie. They could have been manipulative or saccharine but I found them heartbreaking and very well done. But aside from that, all the Guardians get something to do. Quill is grieving for his version of Gamora, Mantis is trying to get some respect from the rest of the group, Nebula is trying to deal with her babyface turn (her move to the lighter side of the character scale) and Drax is trying to help but is coming to terms with his spot in the team. This is a lot to juggle (more on that later) but it also helps they sculpt an appropriately savage villain for the Guardians to bounce off of in The High Evolutionary. Add in Adam Warlock (a hugely powerful but less than intelligent alien who has it out for the Guardians) and you've got quite an assembly. They know how to get you to identify and feel for these characters and Volume 3 delivers in expanding on their motivations and relationships without being too manipulative.It's so cool to see how the Guardians cast's careers have evolved since 2014. Some of the lustre has worn off of Chris Pratt's meteoric rise but they tone down the sarcastic and unfeeling nature of the character and that was the best thing to do. Pratt is more genuine and emotional here and Volume 3 benefits. I liked sarcastic Starlord but the character needed to evolve and Peter did so appropriately. Dave Bautista is still hilarious as Drax, his strong rapport with Pom Klementieff and Chris Pratt is still present and his deadpan style works so well. Karen Gillan played a great antagonist in the first entry and she handles the switch well. Her snarky and angry nature meshes so well for the character, it's too bad because I would have liked to see her in more movies as this character. Pom is still great, they needed to expand on her character too and Volume 3 accomplishes that as well. She amplifies Mantis' sweet but courageous nature and she's turned into an integral member of the team. Sean Gunn is still fun in his supporting part as Kraglin, he's got good comic timing and he's always been funny. I liked Maria Balakova as Cosmo, it's only voice work but she gives the character some personality. I enjoyed Will Poulter as Adam Warlock, his take on the character was different from what I expected but he's effortlessly funny and yet threatening as the character that's huge on power but weak on maturity and charisma. Zoe Saldana and Vin Diesel return as Gamora and Groot respectively. It's a nice change to see Saldana playing a more ruthless version of Gamora and Vin is still distinctive and dependable in voicework as the stoic but memorable Groot. The most underrated performance came from Chukwudi Iwudi as The High Evolutionary. A common criticism of Marvel's movies is that the villains are lacklustre but Chukwudi was fantastic. His scenes with the CGI Rocket have so much emotion and through his work, they cultivate a feud between him and Rocket that goes beyond hero vs. V=villain. His character's rationale is simple but brutal and he's appropriately operatic to amp up the fated clash between him and the Guardians.While we're used to Marvel grabbing glowingly effusive reviews (for the most part anyway), I'm a little surprised the buzz on this one has been so mixed. I do have a couple of notes however. I enjoyed that all the main players were given something to do but the movie did feel a little overstuffed. It didn't really bother me but some of the fat could have been trimmed off for a leaner film. Also, there's some concessions made towards James Gunn's more typical style in this for better or worse. In some aspects like the action and the new character designs, Volume 3 becomes more distinct. But there is a fair amount of gross stuff which gives the movie some distinctive style but I was left cringing at some of the \"juicier\" bits.The Guardians franchise has always been special to me ever since Starlord danced his way across that first cave in 2014. Between the heart wrenching opening and the unique flavour of the immediately following heist, I knew I was in for something awesome. Volume 3 is dark and dramatic but it proves how invested you are in these characters. I almost teared up a couple of times in this movie and I laughed a bunch. The action is tight and provides what you want spending $15 on a 3D ticket. I'm not sure this will turn the rising tide against the genre but I really enjoyed this movie and I'm happy my memories of the previous entries weren't tainted by an unnecessary and lacklustre sequel. No matter what you think of Gunn's personal comedic styling, he's a great writer/director and he's engine that makes this franchise roar. I'd wholly recommend Volume 3 if you liked any of the previous movies, as a fan it was almost everything I ever hoped for in a finale.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 9}, "heading": "An Emotional and Well Crafted Finale For Perhaps Marvel's Best Standalone Franchise", "date": "2023-05-06T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9036459", "sentiment score": [0.0021, 0.0174, 0.157, 0.7458, 0.0777]}, {"content": "Don't wait for spoilers to ruin this movie for you.

Incredibly touching and poignant. I definitely cried more than once. The film deals with themes of eugenics and animal cruelty and while it definitely be hard to watch at times, I think James Gunn did a good job with it.Things I specifically liked - Rocket. Easily the heart and soul of the film. He doesnt have much action in this film. Most of his scenes are flashbacks. But completely integral to the plot and adding dimension to his character. He'll break your heart for sure. The High Evolutionary was honestly one of the best villains we have got so far. Has to be one of the most evil, most heartless villains. Nebula was great as well. I loved how far her character has come and how much she has grown. Despite being mostly robotic at this point, she is the most human here. I also really did like Will Poulter as Adam Warlock, though he doesnt get much to do in this film. I dont think he was necessary to this specific film so it feels kind of wasted. Though Im excited to see what else they can do with him, if they decide to bring him back.Speaking of things being a waste, the f bomb. I had heard before going into the movie that this would be the MCU's first f bomb, and so when I heard it in the movie, I was like \"This is the moment you used it on?\". Could of have been cooler and more significant. But I mean, thats such a small thing to gripe about. Even though I did love getting more of Rocket's backstory, I did think a lot of the interactions with Lila, Teefs and Floor were cheesy and a little too on the nose. I also dont think Gamora was really needed in this movie either.

They all delivered. I'd probably rate 9/10. Maybe 10/10 as the wrap up of the guardians story also felt very right.However I'm going to talk about something I haven't seen the other reviews mention. This was very dark and the extent of animal cruelty is tough to watch.Sure, the overall message is that animal cruelty is bad, and to save the animals. But, the line walked is very blurry.There is an element of glorifying animal experimentation to create cute gimmicks or cybernetic monsters.There are animal characters that you are given the backstory for so you feel for their plight and there are others who clearly would have gone through the same turmoil but their backstory is not explored so you are expected to switch off and simply think of them as 'baddies'.I get it, where do you draw the line, all these movies have gratuitous violence, most of the movies kept the villains one dimensional to avoid this, others PG'd the violence. This movie went that little step further, many of the big bad's army / henchmen are clearly animal hybrid experiments, I think they thought of these ones looks scary enough or more robotic then it's okay.There are two scenes in particular that made me deeply uncomfortable. Don't worry no spoilers! There is a cybernetic pig whose head gets ripped off, the head is then held for the next scene and I think the scene is intended to be funny, it wasn't for me.The other scene is the big 'avengers assemble' fight scene moment. This time the baddies are again cybernetic octopuses, bears and god knows what else. However the scene right before it was tugging at your heartstrings for the animals that were experimented, and clearly these creatures were also the result of the same experiments. This scene also does not shy away from blood, guts and maiming.

He moved on to writing the Scooby Doo movies and the Dawn of the Dead remake before making Slither. But he's always had comic book aspirations from early films like The Specials and Super. The adaptions he's made so far have been smaller affairs, starting with Guardians of the Galaxy.The Guardians are the kind of characters that not that many people were aware of before the movies. The characters come from the kind of books you once found in quarter bins. Starlord was first in Marvel Preview #4 in January 1976 with Rocket Racoon appearing three issues later before not being used again until May 1982's The Incredible Hulk #271. In the first thirty years of their existence, Starlord rarely appeared and Rocket only was in ten comic books.The Guardians were the same way, first showing up all the way back in the January 1969 Marvel Super-Heroes #16. Roy Thomas said, \"Guardians of the Galaxy started out as an idea of mine: about super-guerrillas fighting against Russians and Red Chinese who had taken over and divided the USA. I got a sort of general approval from Stan Lee and gave the idea to Arnold Drake, since I had not time to write and research it. Arnold went in for a conference with Stan, and Stan (maybe Arnold, too) decided to change it to an interplanetary situation. All the characters and situations in Guardians were created by Arnold and/or Stan.\"They appeared every once every few years but didn't really take hold until June 1990. That's when Jim Valentino created the Guardians that I've always loved. Few of them are in these movies -- Martinex shows up in a cameo, Yondu is a lot different -- but that series was one of the true joys of the grim and gritty early 1990s.Then, in 2008, following the Annihilation: Conquest series, we got the Guardians team that led to the film series, which wow, was a gamble.The Guardian movies changed the idea of what the Marvel Cinematic Universe was all about. Instead of do gooders, the Guardians were space pirates, the children of world killing final bosses and scarred survivors of worlds destroyed, the last of their kind. And yet, the films had a comedic tone that inspired the Thor movies and gave the Avengers films some comedic lift.So here we are with Gunn's last movie before leaving to lead another attempt at DC movies. And throughout the ads for this movie, the hype and even the film itself, it has the feel of Lando in Return of the Jedi, constantly feeling like someone is going to die and you're going to lose that character forever.The fact that this movie has those stakes and you have those feelings points to its strength.I've also been thinking about how no one wants to be challenged by art any longer. Now, go with me on this, even if you don't believe that comic book movies are cinema. I believe they are and that comics are no different than mythology or any heroic myth.Tonight during The Last Drive-In, the Twitter audience was complaining that one of the two selections, Tigers Are Not Afraid, was too dark and they couldn't make jokes and fun of the movie. Playing Mystery Science Theater 3000 is not why I watch movies. Nor is needing a support group and being there for one another during troubling movies. Movies should push your emotions.A lot of criticism directed against Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 lies in its tone. There are children enslaved by the High Evolutionary, who also figures into the origin of Rocket, tearing him apart and rebuilding him into the cybernetic cynical creature that he has become.And let me tell you, there are moments in that origin that are harrowing and in no way for kids. But the fact that they can push our emotions and make us notice those narratives shifts, well...isn't that what great movies should do?This is the kind of movie that can have a spaceship that has been made out of the severed head of a dead space god; a talking Russian cosmodog with mental powers; that has a world called Counter-Earth filled with animal people and all the problems of our world; and also one that finds each of the Guardians with very real issues: Starlord (Chris Pratt) has fallen into a drunken stupor after the double loss -- once in death, another as she was reborn as a being that does not remember him -- of Gamora (Zoe Saldana ); Nebula (Karen Gillan) making the grand journey from unstoppable amoral killing machine into the person responsible for the lives of the misfits that live inside Knowhere; Drax the Destroyer (Dave Bautista, as always, growing as an actor) also making growth from killer to father, the role he was always meant for; Mantis (Pom Klementieff) dreaming of a better life; Groot (Vin Diesel) communicating with just three words; even Kraglin (Sean Gunn) trying to assume the mantle of leadership that Yondu left to him.The movie gets going when Adam Warlock (Will Poulter), the creation of first movie villain Ayesha (Elizabeth Debicki), blasts into Knowhere and nearly kills Rocket, whose body is made of machine code that doesn't allow him to be healed. To save their friend, the Guardians make a deal with the devil -- Gamora -- and track down who created Rocket, even if it means they have to fly into what looks for all intents and purposes to be a space butthole.Despite being fired -- that social story about Gunn was always wrong -- Gunn would come back for this last story, telling The Hollywood Reporter, \"\"In the end, my love for Rocket, Groot, Gamora, Star-Lord, Yondu, Mantis, Drax, and Nebula -- and some of the other forthcoming heroes -- goes deeper than you guys can possibly imagine, and I feel they have more adventures to go on and things to learn about themselves and the wonderful and sometimes terrifying universe we all inhabit.\"And that's why I loved this movie.Yes, it's dark. Yes, the tone shifts a lot. Yes, it's overstuffed with ideas.But why is that a bad thing?Maybe we need to be challenged.A few other random things I enjoyed:The music: I usually make fun of needledrop moments in movies, but that's often because they're so obvious. Instead, this movie features some songs I genuinely love in moments that they truly fit: Faith No More's \"We Care a Lot,\" Spacehog's \"In the Meantime,\" The Replacements' \"I Will Dare,\" Alice Cooper's cover of the vaudeville song \"I'm Always Chasing Rainbows\" are all absolutely the right songs at the right time, topped by the Adrian Belew mention in the credits scenes.The end: I don't want to give anything away, but after an entire movie of those Lando moments, the feeling as \"Dogs Days Are Over\" plays are so uplifting that it makes the entire film cathartic. You go through the darkness to find the light.The deep Marvel characters: Beyond Sylvester Stallone returning as Starhawk, there's also Martinex (Michael Rosenbaum), Mainframe (Tara Strong instead of Miley Cyrus), Howard the Duck (Seth Green), The Broker (Christopher Fairbank) from the first movie, Bzermikitokolok (Rhett Miller from The Old 97s), Phylla (the daughter of Captain Mar-Vell in the Marvel comics; she's the young girl fighting alongside the new Guardians in the end credits) and Lem sorcerer Krugarr.Finally, a bad guy you can hate: Gunn and Chukwudi Iwuji worked to make the High Evolutionary a character with nothing redeeming or sad about him. Instead, he's near pure evil, a scientist who sees every creation as expendable, but shocked that Rocket, a throwaway creation, was somehow smarter than him.Also: this has the first f-bomb in MCU history, a \"The Legendary Star-Lord will return\" credit that reminded me of when they did that at the end of every James Bond movie and a gunfight sequence with Groot and Starlord that felt like John Woo within the MCU.And finally: When Rocket realizes what the High Evolutionary has done, as he screams in utter despair, only to finally see the sky moments later, wow. Just wow. That's why I go to the movies.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 5, "votes": 11}, "heading": "Great!", "date": "2023-05-06T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9035683", "sentiment score": [0.0956, 0.5545, 0.2747, 0.0667, 0.0085]}, {"content": "James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 brings the trilogy to an electrifying ending. The film follows Peter Quill, Star-Lord, as he assembles the Guardians of the Galaxy on an important mission. Its cast includes Chris Pratt, Bradley Cooper, Dave Bautista, Zoe Salda\u00f1a, Karen Gillan, and Chukwudi Iwuji.Back in 2018, James Gunn was fired by Disney when a series of very offensive tweets resurfaced. Almost immediately, DC Comics swooped in, hiring Gunn as a director, giving him complete control on any DC project of his choice. This led to 2021's The Suicide Squad, an excellent film, which likely led to Gunn being appointed as DC's CEO in 2022. Before this, following a public apology, Disney rehired Gunn to direct the final installment of the Guardians franchise, his final Marvel film.The strongest aspect of this film was the characters. The core Guardians members are portrayed as a dysfunctional family, which greatly benefits the film's comedic scenes, with each member bickering with each other. A standout in this aspect is Pom Klementieff's Mantis and Dave Bautista's Drax arguing with Karen Gillan's Nebula. The three have great chemistry and comedic timing. The comedy in this film is very well placed, serving not only as a way to further the characters but also as a palate cleanser after the darker scenes.Surprisingly, this film had a great amount of emotional depth. The film really gets audience members to become invested in these characters' stories, particularly Bradley Cooper's Rocket. Cooper delivers a heartbreaking voice performance that greatly elevates the film's dramatic scenes. Many of these scenes don't even include live actors, but instead realistically animated animals. Chukwudi Iwuji, who plays the antagonist, gives a great performance during these emotional scenes that will get audience members, especially animal lovers, to absolutely despise his character. Even though these emotional beats are somewhat predictable, they still hit you like a brick.Gunn masterfully uses action to reinforce the film's emotional beats by providing viscerally violent action, justified by the film's main message of empathy. During the more fun action scenes, Gunn utilizes dynamic cinematography and a killer soundtrack blended with fantastic special effects, immersing viewers and allowing each member of the Guardians a chance to shine, leading to the conclusion of their character arcs by the end of the film.Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 is a stark departure from recent Marvel projects, taking the franchise to darker places. In my opinion, the more mature themes tackled in this film project the franchise forward, allowing the characters and universe as a whole to grow. As much as I'd love to see these characters down the line, this film serves as a definitive end to their stories, and Disney should respect that.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 SkyROCKETs the Franchise", "date": "2023-05-06T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9035669", "sentiment score": [0.0058, 0.0372, 0.1731, 0.6664, 0.1175]}, {"content": "Rocket is injured and the key to his recovery is a passkey that is held by the High Evolutionary, a cruel man in search of a perfect utopia, by experimenting on animals.

Overall, GOTG3 is an uproarious, emotional and probably the best marvel flicks after endgame which leaves you with smile in the end.Goods?Storyline is simple but most importantly a heartfelt and emotionally immersive one.That infectious chemistry between the leads is the best part of the film.Action set pieces are fresh and brilliant along with stunning vfx.Wonderful Humour which crackles you from time to time.Performances from everyone is fantastic.Antagonist Integration was engaging and solid.Bads?This is the last part of the franchise.The mid and post credit scenes were dumb.Watch it?100 %.

All the phase 4 movies pale in comparison to Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3.There are a few things I love about this movie, one of them is Rockets backstory being fleshed out in the movie, really gives an interesting past to an already interesting character, it was done really well and I will give credit on how Rocket looks so cute as small baby racoon. Another thing I love about this movie is Drax, oh how he makes me chuckle every time he's on screen and him with Mantis? Oh that just makes a perfect comedy duo. Gamora of course is also really good in this movie, they handled her character well. The comedy in this movie really works I feel it's still more of the usual quirky marvel comedy but this time it's pretty good and it did have a little slapstick which caught me off guard and made me have a little laugh. The last thing I think worth mentioning is the action, I love it especially a certain hallway scene where we get to see all the Guardians highlighted and Groot just being a badass is great also Knowhere is pretty Goddamn epic.But there are a few things I wish could've been done better in the movie like High Evolutionary, he's actually a decent character that makes you just want to beat the stuff out of him but I think they could've shown his powers a little better, and Adam Warlock feels like a waste of potential his character could've been done much better.All and all this movie is pretty good, in no way it breaks new ground or is a masterpiece but still it deserves 9 stars in my personal opinion.

There were some moments with other characters where the humor was forced but overall it felt organic.I enjoyed how Chris Pratt and Zoe Saldana were able to display their chemistry even with their dynamic relationship.

With the use of flashbacks his backstory is pieced together to give some emotional moments.All of the character designs are well put together except for some of the guards in a certain scene that look like they are just humans wearing weird bubble suits. The best character design by far was the main villain played by Chukwudi Iwuji. I really enjoyed his look and his story in this movie. Personally I wanted him to be more fierce considering he was the main villain. Sean Gunn who played Kraglin was another character I wanted more from although he wasn't disappointing.The one character that did disappoint was Will Poulter as Adam Warlock. I wouldn't blame Poulter, I felt he did what was asked of him as an actor. I put blame on the writers. Adam Warlock was an underwhelming character that only served as a very weak comic relief.His character arc was predictable and his scene involving Chris Pratt towards the end of the film was one of the weaker moments.Overall, I think this movie is just good.

It's definitely the most darkest and most emotional film to ever come to the MCU, making sure it pays its tributes and giving each of its characters a moment to shine bright. This movie reminds all fans alike what makes the MCU as great as it is. It gives us characters that we have come to love, the best and most proper send off they could have. After dealing with the loss of Gamora, Peter Quill must bring together the Guardians for a mission to save one of their own that may be the end of them if not successful. Hands down the stand out characters of the film is Chris Pratt's Peter Quill/Star Lord and Bradley Coopers Rocket Racoon, bringing us a side of the characters we have never seen before and probably the best versions of the characters we have ever seen. This was hands down Chris Pratt's best performance as Peter Quill/ Star Lord and shows us how far he is willing to go in order to save those he loves. As heart breaking as the scenes were to watch, I was glad that James Gunn was able to tell Rocket's full story on how he became who he is as unsettling as it was to watch at times. It shows how while also why he is one of the most important and broken characters ever in the MCU. Zoe Saldana's Gamora was also fantastic bringing us a different side of her character we have never seen before. Dave Bautista's Drax had some of the funniest lines of the entire film as well as Karen Gillian's Nebula. I was also glad to see more of Pom Klementieff's Mantis using her powers. Vin Diesel's Groot I also thought was a highlight of the film, bringing us a different kind of Groot than we have seen in the past. Maria Bakalova as Cosmo the Spacedog was great at voicing the character. Sean Gunn's Kraglin I was glad to see have more screen time than any of the other Guardian films and show off his own set of skills. Chukwudi Iwuji's High Evolutionary is absolutely terrifying, psychotic, and probably one of the most hateful villains of the MCU and the way he is able to capture all of his character's mannerisms is while also unsettling to watch, but fascinating, because of how good of a actor he really is making his villain one of the best in my opinion in the MCU just by how menacing he is. Will Poulter's Adam Warlock I was finally glad to see come the the MCU and he did not disappoint, although I felt like he wasn't used quite as much as he was anticipated to, he still had a great introduction for the MCU. When it comes to the visuals, this is definitely the most visually stunning of all of the Guardians of the Galaxy films. Overall, James Gunn has pulled off the proper send off for some of the greatest characters to ever come to the MCU, using great character arcs, a unsettling while also sometimes disturbing tone, great visuals, and a incredible story that leaves you feeling sad, but satisfied with the end result.

And it's a heartwarming tale. You get your monies worth as it goes for about 2 1/2 hours and it's a fun ride.

Many of the main characters are at death's door on many occasions with no consequences. Multiple fight scenes involving every character so you can't tell what's happening. Drax and Mantis' banter is mostly just obnoxious. They're like kids you just want to smack the whole time. Nebula just yells at everybody for 2 and a half hours.

Marvel isn't a childhood fantasy of some sadness to drum up the hero(s) triumph during the end of the film. Marvel is dark. Marvel tells a story. The first Iron Man, which many love, was a dark movie that showed but didn't detail gun running, slavery, kidnapping, and murder on a scale that is hard to imagine. Guardians of the Galaxy Volume 3 shows torture, it shows gruesome and grotesque violence, it shows the dark side of the universe not just on a cosmic scale like Ego the living planet but on the wave length of Thanos without a purpose.The High Evolutionary.as told in the movie as some critics have called is a hammy over-the-top unrealistic villain. If that is all you think of this man read Frankenstein. A man who wants to create life but at what cost. He is hammy within reason and unreasonable but sensibly; In other words he is insane in his pursuit of perfection and will stop at nothing to get it. Take the ending to the movie where Rocket is helping the animals escape the dying ship, there are no otters, seals, or rabbits, but there were lots of raccoons. The High Evolutionary wants to recreate rocket and create the perfect intelligent ever evolving race and since the raccoon gave birth to ideas he wants to recreate it but doesn't know how, thus he wants rocket while experimenting with the raccoons he already has. As for his face? He believe it is to cover the imperfections that Rocket caused him during his escape almost like Handsome Jack from Borderlands. If you believe a villain like that is hammy or \"not realistic\", then you missed the point.Adam Warlock is my only negative thing about this movie as I personally feel that he could've been portrayed better, but he wasn't acting irrationally and he is truly someone that can be expanded infinitely upon. If you have read the original Adam Warlock books or comics you know how I feel, but this is a different Earth in a different timeline in a different multiverse so the cast and crew can drum up how they want this Adam Warlock to fight their expectations.If you want to go see a Marvel movie that isn't strictly comedy, isn't strictly serious, but tells a story that roundabouts from beginning to end, this is the movie for you. This movie is not full of light, this movie is not the hero always winning, for everyone good hero to save everyone a hero will also lose just as much. He experiences pain, suffering, and loss as depicted not just in the comics or the source material but also in more fleshed out tv shows like Punisher. They use property like Cosmo the dog and Howard the duck in their environments, not to try and create a cash grab for including their likeness in the movie. If you think the first half of the movie sucks because Peter is drained and dreary, of course he is! He knows Gamora is alive, he knows the person he loves doesn't remember him. HE WANTS WHAT CANNOT BE OF COURSE YOU WILL FEEL DRAINED BOTH MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY. If you don't understand that you don't understand love. The goodbyes feel natural, like a son moving out to peruse college or a family member retiring to experience the life they missed their entire time. A dad wants to raise kids and be a family man with a family that may not be his by blood, but his by choice and acceptance. There are some potholes in the movie like how does the children speak Drax's language if his people died to Thanos. How does Gamora come back to life. How did she meet the Ravagers. How come the High Evolutionary only test his projects on animals and not on people. These are plot holes and mysteries and let them be plot holes and mysteries because at the end of the day.A good story has mystery. A good story has inconsistencies. A good story tells a story. There are ups and downs some graphic and intense some light heard and joyful, but if you can grasp the story that Marvel was trying to tell, it is one of the most beautiful and tragic stories in all of Marvel.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 3}, "heading": "This is Marvel at its core", "date": "2023-05-06T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9035266", "sentiment score": [0.1095, 0.2879, 0.2618, 0.2572, 0.0837]}, {"content": "I'm not quite sure how a franchise that has knocked it out of the park to date (with one exception) could've messed up the formula this badly.Maybe I should've paid more attention to the writing on the wall after that one Christmas Special miss, but I just assumed that project was an easy paycheck and not a directional change.GotG3 starts weirdly and is super choppy throughout.

The movie's CG shots were meant for 3D. If anyone criticizes the CGI, it's because they probably saw it in widescreen 2D. Also, it was great that I didn't have to hear robotic studio audience laughs, obnoxious gasps or exaggerated cries. With the way many of the scenes can quickly go from sad to funny, and mildly funny to really funny and vice versa, I appreciated being on the same emotional level as the others sitting around me, where we laughed when it was only laugh-out-loud funny and kept quiet and still when it got intense. And with the amazing musical sequences it had, you wouldn't want a bunch of woo's overtaking them. The wrong audience can affect your opinion on the movie. I think it's better as an intimate experience. I'm someone who loves watching movies with a big crowd btw! So hopefully that gives some insight. To put it in words, this movie isn't meant to be like a roller coaster event the way Endgame or Ragnarok were. Those movies were meant for collective experiences. This one, as many people describe it similarly, is more grounded as an MCU movie than its predecessors. Now to deep dive in the movie itself!It's endearing, intense, and gratifying. That's the best I can objectively describe it. The story felt complete by the end, and I enjoyed every second of the movie. It tricks you quite a bit as well.I really enjoyed the cinematography, the action (which was definitely dialed up compared to the last two), and the soundtrack. They brought a new vibe that both continues that familiar GOTG style and sets it apart as something different. The acting from everyone was top-tier. Not to be too specific or spoilery, but the screams and tears from different characters in the movie were very realistic and traumatizing.So about the emotional aspect: it's definitely enough to break those who get easily emotional. But for me personally, it wasn't. Except for one particular scene/flashback from Rocket's past that almost made me tear up. My eyes watered so maybe that counts? I did get emotional from how heavy a moment it was. It was very well done. But I wouldn't say this movie is a cry fest. Much of it is actually joyful only because you've grown attached to the characters, so when they interact with each other that sways from their constant banter, those moments would make you feel something inside. The feeling that makes you smile.Lastly, just to touch on the negative things I've read and heard, I'll go through them quickly and share my opinion. Here we go:1. Long runtime: No, it's fine.2. Poor humor: No, that's just the Guardians' usual banter. Not every joke is supposed to be a crowd pleaser. It had some really funny moments, but most of it was just funny on the inside.3. Peter/Star-Lord not having his boosters or helmet: Yeahhh, that was unfortunate. I agree with that. He didn't have his usual gear at all, just his blasters. I'm not sure why but it didn't matter much.4. Terrible movie/another MCU flop: Well, everyone's different. And a lot of times, things like your viewing experience, your mindset at the time, what movies you crave, those factors play into how you perceive a new movie. Someone who says it's bad now may completely change their mind a year later! Timing is everything. Of course, there's also preferences and nitpicks, and what can I say. Some people don't like certain movies, even if they're pretty good. I think it's important for everyone to be open-minded. So far, reviews have been great for the movie, and I agree with that consensus. If it was really that bad, I would've felt that because movies are my passion. But I will say, you can definitely nitpick the heck out of this movie. So it's worth keeping in mind when looking at other reviews, including my own.I had a good time, and I'd love to see it again.

It doesn't. The emotional payoffs aren't there, and the film leaves you feeling manipulated and cheated. Where Rian Johnson attempts to subvert audience's expecations, Gunn subverts their emotions. Neither seem to regard their audiences as anything other than lab rats.However, Gunn isn't without talent, and there are several beautiful shot compositions, some clever writing and a few instances of well used music. Gunn even at his worst and most self-indulgent is still more interesting than the usual MCU conveyer belt slop. Any 5 minutes of GotG3 has more humor and heart than the entirety of Thor Love and Thunder or Eternals.It's a shame. James Gunn is undoubtedly talented, but he is too full of himself to temper himself when story demands it, and there's something really misanthropic and sadistic about him, that just seeps into his movies. He trivializes suffering and cruelty in a way that is indicative of a psychopathic mind, like someone who would watch Schindler's List and make scat jokes about the boys hiding in the toilet.I can separate the artist from the art, however, and maintain that the first GotG1 is one of the best MCU movies to date (if not the best).

It's an emotional journey, and, for me, a bit of a tearjerker - bring some tissues. I connected strongly with the characters and throughout the movie deeply cared about them.

Gunn has made these movies unique and distinct from the other Marvel movies. Although it's still funny, this movie resonates emotionally with the audience more than the first two Guardians. You can feel the pain and traumatic experiences of the characters. Star Lord as Chris Pratt is perfect. I've never seen a role as good as this one for Pratt, and for me he will always be Peter Quill. Even though Rocket is completely CGI, Bradley Cooper's voice performance makes me believe he is real. My favorite character is Drax (David Bautista) because he is very sweet and funny, and whenever he's on screen, I enjoy it immensely.The message of this movie is that friendship and teamwork are the most powerful forces in the galaxy.

Luckily, the bad guy is just an evil scientist with his scary vision presented in a soft-horror way. James Gunn decided to reinvented the third act and gave up with a classic bombastic finale where good guys are fighting a bad buy. It's a movie about the family, so we spend more time with them to reach their well-done pay-offs. However, nobody should be worried about lack of badass action scenes because it's a plenty of them and these are unforgettable.One of my favourite parts is the ending because we as the audience have an opportunity to think about Groot's language. I don't want to spoil anything but pay attention. I think it's a lovely thanks to us.GOTG movies are well-known for great music and funny jokes. Once again, if you loved it previously, there's a high chance you will laugh and nod your head :)My rating isn't 10/10 because I found some flows such as underused Adam Warlock and Drax. I feel Drax is kept to be a goofy comic relief all the time. He is a warm muscular man who could do definitely more. He is relevant to the story but I think he should have more depth. Adam Warlock is impressive when he appears for the first time and after that there is nothing to do with him.The movie is definitely the best one since Infinity War. The reason behind it is, it's not just another blockbuster movie about a space adventure, it's a delicious meal where you can feel the taste of each ingredient.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 3}, "heading": "Guardians deserve your money!", "date": "2023-05-05T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9034958", "sentiment score": [0.004, 0.0234, 0.1741, 0.7145, 0.0839]}, {"content": "Y'all must have watched a different movie than me.

It was coherent with the narrative and everything actually made sense.Marvel usually overdoses in throwing in jokes and comedy whenever they can and it misses most of the time but with this movie, 95% of the jokes were hitting and I was actually cracking a smile during them even though I usually don't especially with the character of Drax. The other 5% were the Mantis jokes which FOR ME, weren't hitting MOST of the time, but in general it was all good.All the cast were amazing no need to mention all of them everyone knows the crew at this point.The High Evolutionary, which is the main villain which was played by Chukwudi Iwuji was very good and it shows that villains that are just filled with pure evil and nothing more while lacking motive can sometimes still be as good.As to Adam warlock, I was very excited to see him on the big screen since I last saw him in the \"marvel's guardians of the galaxy\" game, and he delivered but I was bit disappointed with how much screen time he got, he got decent screen time but I just wished I've seen more with him with some more depth around him.Marvel you've done it congratulations, THIS is how you make a movie.P.

Here is my personal impression of the movie. The review is absolutely spoiler free!Plot / Storytelling / Pacing (spoiler free)The plot is actually quite simple, but despite the simplicity there is a lot of stuff between the lines. On the surface, it's about the Guardians trying to save a friend in their own ranks and going up against the High Evolutionary in the process. Under the surface, however, it's about much more than that. It's about what friendship and trust mean and how far one would go for them. It's about sacrifice, about loyalty, and about genuine feelings between individual Guardians. It is also about the cohesion of renegades, outsiders and outcasts.Furthermore, it is about what \"life\" means and whether there is such a thing as evolutionary perfection at all, that it is morally questionable to decide about life and death for the supposedly higher goal of the \"perfect society\" and to no longer value life itself as such, regardless of whether it is perfect or flawed. What is the use of striving for a perfect life and a perfect society, if one loses all empathy on the way there and does not even shy away from mass murder in order to achieve one's goals. Shouldn't one set an example for such a future oneself?The film is so full of messages and it touches on many topics. Despite all these complex issues, the film still manages to come across as very light hearted, a lot of fun and enjoyable, feel good without, again, the drama also losing its power, which is also very strongly staged in some scenes. Here no eye remains dry and there are some scenes that have touched me deeply, shocked and made me gulp. Even two days after the viewing, I still have to think a lot about the plot.It's also worth mentioning that this film addresses unanswered questions from the two predecessors and brings loose ends to a great conclusion.To follow the plot, it is enough to know \"Guardians of the Galaxy 1 & 2\" as well as \"Avengers: Infinity War\" and \"Avengers: Endgame\". The latter two also only to know what happened to Gamora and that we are dealing here with Gamora from the past, who never came into contact with the Guardians until the events of \"Endgame\" and accordingly has a different relationship status with them.Actors / CharactersThe Guardians team continues to exude extreme charm in the third installment. The characters skillfully pass the ball to each other and one dialogue is better, more biting, funnier or more dramatic than the other. It's incredible how much fun it is to watch the Guardians, to sympathize with them or to fear for them. The actors/actresses behind Guardians know how to get me as a viewer attached to the characters and capture my heart. I fear for every single character. Of course, this is only possible because both James Gunn as director and screenwriter and the actors all seem to get along wonderfully on set. You can feel in every scene of the film how well the teamwork of the actors works with each other and with the director.It's also great that every character is allowed to shine and there is no one who comes up short. Each character is allowed to develop (meaningfully!) and they all rise above. There are highs, there are lows, and each character contributes something to the team and to the victory. There is never a feeling that any of the characters are superfluous. Each has their strengths and weaknesses, and these are used believably and ingeniously or woven into the dialogue and plots.Even apart from the Guardians, the actors/actresses know how to convince. Whether Sean Gunn as Kraglin, Chukwudi Iwuji as High Evolutionary or Will Poulter as Adam Warlock. Their characters are not particularly multi-layered or complex, but it is enough to generate feelings, whether disgust, anger and hatred for the High Evolutionary or sympathy for Kraglin or even hopes in Adam Warlock.SettingThe settings are, as in the two previous films, diverse, varied and totally wacky. Whether it's the Guardians' ship, outer space, space stations made of organic matter, an Earth-like planet with alien species, Knowhere or the dark spaceship of the High Evolutionary, there's plenty of variety for the eye. The settings are always so extremely atmospheric that it's simply a feast for the eyes. The environment animations are also of the highest quality.Camera / EditingThe camera work is once again extremely well done. The perspectives are varied and also very nicely captured. Even some of the perspectives in the Guardians' ship or at the beginning on Knowhere are a real eye-catcher. Slow camera movements and pans, so that you can examine everything nicely, without hectic or too fast cuts. In quiet scenes, but also in fast-paced action scenes, the viewer always keeps a good overview of the action. A fight scene of all Guardians in a long hallway is also ingenious. The camera work is just great.I didn't notice anything negative about the editing either. No hectic or fast cuts that could throw me off while watching.Action scenes / CGIThe action scenes are brilliantly staged, choreographed and great captured on camera. Every action scene is a hell of a lot of fun. The aforementioned hallway fight scene is also brilliant. Grandiose!The animation quality or the CGI is on a very high level and can keep this high level from the beginning to the end of the movie throughout.There are not suddenly extremely bad CGI effects here like in a \"Black Panther\" or \"She-Hulk\", but everything just looks top notch. Especially in sci-fi settings and in outer space, this makes a lot of difference and contributes to the atmosphere and immersion.MusicThe license music used is once again very successful, but overall it doesn't come close to that of the first part in my opinion. The soundtrack composed especially for the film is great, as always. Of course, the Guardians theme appears once or twice, and that always gave me goosebumps. Dramatic or dark scenes are also accompanied by appropriate music.Humor / DramaThe humor of the film is just top notch. Almost every gag is right on the money and during the screening everyone laughed a lot, very loudly and very often. This is simply real situation comedy and spontaneous humor, no silly Waititi slapstick like \"Thor - Love & Thunder\", which just rarely ignites and is almost never really funny. No gag or joke is used inflationary often here. There is nothing like the screaming goats in \"Thor - Love & Thunder\", which were used ten times in the film. It's also great that the humor never takes the wind out of the drama's sails. Dramatic or tragic scenes are respected here and not torpedoed by gags or silly humor. Despite all the humor in the film, the plot and the film still take themselves very seriously and it often goes very heavy on the substance.Personal conclusionChapeau to James Gunn! \"Guardians of the Galaxy: Vol. 3\" is in my eyes the perfect conclusion to the Guardians trilogy.For me, this film is directly THE most emotional MCU film ever, both in terms of positive and negative feelings! In the cinema, no eye remained dry with me. Heftig, as so some scene and so some moment has moved me deeply and touched and as I also equally much in this film laughed from the heart.Also visually, the film is simply a blast, which is again underlined by the great camera work.Before another viewing I do not want to praise too much, but as of now after my first viewing this is one of my five favorite films of the entire MCU and perhaps also the best part of the Guardians trilogy! This is what a good MCU movie should look like and nothing else!James Gunn is a great writer and director, if not the best the MCU has ever had. Too bad he's out now, but good for DC and the new DCU!

It's all that while still being hilarious (Dave Bautista is definitely the scene stealer here) and it's just as wholesome as I would want a finale for these characters to be.It's definitely overstuffed, I liked Will Poulter as Adam Warlock but at the end of the day I just didn't think the character added that much beyond just a random threat the Guardians have to face. There's also an extended flashback subplot that sort of wore out it's welcome for me and I thought The High Evolutionary was just fine as a villain, he started out intriguing but he just devolves into an over the top volatile presence with very little motivation.We've known for a while this was going to be the last time we see most of the cast and you get that sense from almost the very beginning and I was really happy with where all the characters ended.

Sure it is still not a great one, but it does not suck the life out of you as most Marvel productions have done the past couple of years. Tone, content and movie-wise I would say this is sort of a mixture of the two previous Guardians but slightly more graphic and slightly more adult perhaps.I will give this a 1/10 because it is directed by james Gunn. Never going to give any movie he makes any higher score. But in reality this is perhaps a 7/10.The good is that the humour is usually on point. The characters are as great as they always been. The character really are the heart of these movies. CGi really good, music, action, and a pretty satisfying ending of the movie make it more than watchable.Where this movie fails is mainly with the overarching story. So much in this movie that does not make much sense. There is a lot of jumping from this to that, and the movie wants us to abandon all logic every 5min. The ending, although decently satisfying, also lack patos, and where is the post credit scene for The Marvels? Would have been an obvious addition, but nah.The music, although great, is also overused and overdone. Gunn also goes super-Gunn in directing much of this movie with overuse of slow-mo and bombastic music, which is mostly a bad thing. The movie give me a messy feeling, like its too short, or too long. There are entire events and scenes that can easily be deducted and it would only make the movie better.All things considered, I was pretty happy.

Plot, character, heck everything. It commits the worst sin a film like this can make, it's boring.Remember how much fun the first Guardians movie was? Remember how sweet and lovable those characters were? Remember how fresh and silly but genuinely entertaining it was?That's absent here. The movie is overblown, overwrought and has absolutely no clue what it wants to be.Talking about no clue...Adam Warlock. Oh my gosh, they had absolutely no idea what to do with him. It's like they just threw him in because he's been teased in the previous movies. Now he's here and he's not exciting, enjoyable or remotely necessary to the story. Waste of everyone's time.Over the last 9 years we've grown to love these characters. Here, they are bigger, and meaner facsimiles of themselves (to varying degrees) and most importantly I just didn't buy what they were selling.The movie feels like a theme park attraction, but in that cheesy and stupid way you can't help to roll your eyes at. There's very little heart and almost no soul in the movie. It's just going through the motions of a Marvel movie. It's a product that is there to be consumed, but like anything that's made without care or purpose, it leaves you feeling empty inside.Chris Pratt used to be endearing and charming. There was a comedic sensibility to his Peter Quill that was like a child playing Han Solo. That relatability is gone. There are a few lines that land, but most just feel unnecessary. He drops an f-bomb that is funny, but also felt unnecessary immediately afterward.The only thing that worked for me was Rocket and his backstory. They took my favorite character in the Guardians and they framed the film around him, and let me say that it's the only thing that remotely works. We are told his origin while he is in a coma for the majority of the film. His story is engaging, it's a bit unsettling and the only thing that keeps this unnecessarily long film even remotely worth the investment of time.The High Evolutionary, always an intriguing and engaging villain, falls into the Marvel trap of becoming just another bad guy who, while having a purpose for his evil, just isn't all that compelling and interesting to give us a reason to care about what he's doing. He's unsympathetic and poorly deployed. There's very little threat from him, and his motives aren't all that exciting, but I will say they do ring true from his comic counterpart. I'd have leaned into a body horror concept and made it more Dr. Moreau, but here it's a lame, loud and obnoxious version that just didn't engage me.I saw this with a bunch of Marvel fans, everyone around me stuck around for the mid and post-credit scenes and throughout the film, I heard so many people being so frustrated and laughing at how dumb the movie was.We've come to expect a lot from James Gunn. He's a fantastic director, and has the ability to add genuine pathos and soul to many of his characters. Here, we get something that feels half baked and overcooked at the same time. Too many characters, too many plot contrivances that happen out of absolutely nowhere and at the end of the day, it's just not worth the time, money or effort.I wanted to leave the theater. I actually wanted it to end sooner. Gone was that feeling of being a 7 year old. The joy, the wonder the feeling of exhilaration...it's all gone.I try not to be negative, I don't want to rant about things I hate. I want to spread joy, happiness and love. But so many times I found myself wanting to yell at the screen for insulting mine and the audience's collective intelligence and good faith that they had previously earned. When the final dance number (yes, dance number) happened I just felt embarrassed.It left me thinking one thing: exactly who is this movie for? It's too dour and mean for kids, and not engaging or smart enough to appear to adults.Oh, and I wanted to scream at what they did with Groot at the end too.", "rating": 4, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 38, "votes": 76}, "heading": "A total miss that didn't need to be", "date": "2023-05-05T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9034561", "sentiment score": [0.7964, 0.1872, 0.0098, 0.0027, 0.0039]}, {"content": "I am going to make this review short, because I do not want to spoil anything for anyone.

I'd even argue that his flashbacks are some of the best scenes we've seen in any Marvel film to date. On top of that, I really appreciated just how much this whole movie pushes the boundaries of its PG13 rating. We get the first Marvel f-bomb as well as some pretty gory moments by MCU standards. It can clearly be seen that James Gunn was given a lot of leeway to make the movie he wanted and so he was able to get away with a lot more and make callbacks to his horror roots. Additionally, the whole Guardians team has great chemistry together as always and it's great to just be able to see them interact with each other again. I liked the way the movie dealt with Gamora returning and her relationship with Peter Quill. On top of that, I loved the moment when the movie jokingly hinted that we might get something between Star Lord and Nebula which oddly enough I wish we did get, it would've been a great subversion of expectations.Now onto the stuff I liked less and I'll start with the comedy. This was already beginning to be an issue for me with the 2nd movie and it's a problem that all modern Marvel movies have. The comedy in GOTG 3 often felt forced and the jokes were drawn out for too long. I realize that this series is known for being very comedic but maybe the jokes just needed to be placed more naturally, instead of being forced in so much. However, it's just my opinion though and I at least appreciate that there weren't any jokes in the moments that were supposed to be serious. Furthermore, the soundtrack was less appealing to me this time around but it might just be due to my preference for 70s soft rock and this entry expanding into a different musical era. On top of that, it does what all Marvel projects do which is have a massive CGI battle at the end. And yes, some moments are great in this battle like the one-take corridor sequence but I was still left switching off and thinking about something else when the bloated action sequences were happening. What did keep me engaged for the most part however was the genuine tension that I felt as I was sure that one or more of the Guardians will be dead by the end. The tension however was unwarranted as no characters died and this was a major disappointment.The lack of character deaths prevented this film from feeling like the finale it was intended to be. If one or two Guardians bit the bullet in a definitive way I would've probably raised my rating to an 8. If Rocket wasn't laid out for most of the film and instead was kidnapped, he could've died during the final battle. The heaven scene could've then actually ended with him following Lylla and thus maximizing the emotional impact. Additionally, I feel like Star Lord perishing would've really been a great way to end it all but maybe in a better manner than with him trying to save his Zune. Also, the Guardians splitting up doesn't feel satisfying at all to me. It's the classic trope of a group of people splitting up only to realize they were the happiest when they were together. This is all just my opinion but the lack of finality and the setup for all of these characters returning in future Marvel movies lessened the supposed impact of this being the last time we see the Guardians together. We might not get Guardians of the Galaxy 4, although I wouldn't be surprised if we do but I bet we will see them team up again together in Avengers or another project, even if briefly. It all just doesn't feel like the epic conclusion that we were promised but rather a setup for how these characters will feature in the MCU going forward. I guess comic book movies can never have proper endings and even something great like Logan proves it with Hugh Jackman set to return for Deadpool 3. Maybe I shouldn't expect these films to provide conclusions because the studios will always try to get more from these characters and actors if there is money to be made. However, overall, even though a lot of this review might've seemed negative I did very much enjoy the movie but it just didn't wow me like it seemed to do most people and it simply lacked the finality that I personally desired from it.", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 102, "votes": 145}, "heading": "Much better than most of the recent Marvel projects but not as strong as the previous Guardians of the Galaxy instalments", "date": "2023-05-05T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9034419", "sentiment score": [0.0078, 0.0433, 0.1663, 0.6223, 0.1602]}, {"content": "The reason why I gave this movie a 10 out of 10 is because it's very rare that a film can induce such deep sorrow, and also seething anger at the same time.

Rocket's backstory especially feels so manipulative in its melodrama that it comes dangerously close to misery porn, as though Gunn and crew sat around the writers' room constantly asking, \"how can we make this more depressing?\" The film gets so grim at parts that when the series trademark humor shows up, rather than lightening the mood it instead feels out of place and tonally inconsistent.Another note on the grim dark nature of the film is that even though it's still rated PG-13, it skirts closer to an R rating than any other MCU film so far. While not overly gratuitous, there some moments of genuine brutal violence that were kind of surprising. And it's the first MCU film to drop an F-bomb. I honestly think a lot of parents are gonna be taken aback by just what a different kind of film this was compared to the other two.The pace of the film is either good or bad depending on your personal view; long story short it is a very fast paced movie. The kind of JJ Abrams break neck pace that never lets the audience stop and mull over anything that happens, it's always moving forward. Yet, despite that I still felt the movie was about 15-20 minutes longer than it needed to be. Not every movie needs to have an epic length run time.My biggest issue with the film though was the ending; rather than the satisfying conclusions to the other films this one just kind of peeters out at the end with no real sense of closure. Which is bizarre given that this is supposed to be the final film with the OG cast and crew. This feels less like a series finale and more like a season finale, with everyone set to start up again in the future should the money be good enough.So what did I like? The cast is great as usual, these people clearly enjoy working with each other and they are charming to watch together. The FX, while not amazing, are better than any recent MCU film and the action scenes are pretty great. Probably my favorite part was the the High Observer. Unlike many recent Disney projects where there are no bad guys/gals, just misunderstood anti-heroes, the villain here is unmitigatedly evil and that makes him feel much more threatening than any MCU baddie in recent memory.In the end this isn't a bad movie, but it's not a great one either. It's easily the worst Guardians film, but is still leagues better than any other phase 4/5 MCU film with the exception of 'No Way Home'. If you love the series then maybe check it out, but be warned that it's a very different beast that what you've likely come to expect.", "rating": 6, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 77, "votes": 143}, "heading": "It's different, but not necessarily in a good way.", "date": "2023-05-05T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9034203", "sentiment score": [0.0696, 0.3694, 0.4028, 0.1432, 0.0151]}, {"content": "If you are looking to redeem your money from Marvel after weakest superhero movie in entire genre ever aka Thor : Love and Thunder, then yes this is the one GOTG-3 is best among Guardians, definitely best among Marvel movies in terms sound effect , visual effects, writing, acting, content everything.

Not only did I love that film, but it was just nice to see something so fresh in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. I continued enjoying these characters in their subsequent film and all of their appearances in films like Avengers: Infinity War or their recent Holiday Special. If you couldn't already tell, of course, I was going to check out Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 when it hit theatres. Well, after viewing it, I'm happy to say that this trilogy has concluded in a satisfying way. I have a couple of complaints, but this film is overall just well-made.Picking up after the events of Avengers: Endgame and The Holiday Special, we catch up with the Guardians and how they have been handling themselves. The film doesn't waste any time in putting Rocket Raccoon front and centre as the heart of the film, as the premise of this particular movie wouldn't exist without him. We learn about his tragic past throughout the film and how it relates to the new villain they have to face, the high evolutionary. This story unfolds while each of the Guardians continues to learn, adapt, and evolve as characters. I would say, even though he's far from the focus of the film here, Drax to me showed the most character development (aside from the obvious Rocket storyline). At the end of the day, all of these characters are likeable, and since James Gunn is back at the helm as writer and director again, I expected nothing less than to have him take care of these characters in a nice way.James Gunn has understood these characters from the very beginning, so it was only fitting that he send them off in his way. Yes, this film does conclude this group's storyline and I felt very satisfied with how it's done. This leads me to my biggest problem with the movie as a whole though. Being a huge fan of how the Marvel films all intersect with each other, since Avengers: Endgame, I must admit that it hasn't been as seamless as it's been in the past. Gamora gets the short end of the stick here since she doesn't know this crew anymore. Throughout the entire film, I found myself wondering why James Gunn had to even include her in the film. It almost seemed like he couldn't not have here there because of the fact that it's a Guardians of the Galaxy film. There were a few scenes where I thought her character bogged down the plot of this film, but I otherwise had a blast.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is one of the most emotional films in the MCU to date and I didn't expect certain things to make me tear up, but I was wrong. Subtle, simple things that happen throughout the film had me tearing up out of both sadness and joy at the same time. It took a bit to get moving for me, but by the time the film reaches its second and third acts, it sings. It benefits once again from a solid soundtrack, great performances across the board, stellar writing and directing by Gunn, and a visual style that MCU has otherwise not had outside of these films. This is a great trilogy, I just wish the Gamora storyline from Avengers: Infinity War hadn't impacted her presence here. If you're a fan of these characters, I think you will appreciate how it all concludes, so I definitely recommend it.", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 6}, "heading": "An Emotionally Driven Story", "date": "2023-05-05T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9034169", "sentiment score": [0.0023, 0.0185, 0.1609, 0.7293, 0.089]}, {"content": "This is the proof that Marvel still can make high quality products.

Following the events of 'Avengers: Endgame' (and, to a lesser degree, 'Thor: Love & Thunder' and the Holiday Special), we pick up with Peter (Pratt), Rocket (Cooper), Groot (Diesel), Nebula (Gillan), Mantis (Klementieff), Drax (Bautista), Cosmo (Bakalova) and Kraglin (Gunn) when they're attacked by Adam Warlock (Poulter) and Rocket is injured, sending them on a journey to save him.We see a lot - maybe too much? - of Rocket's history via flashback and how he came to be. While a lot of this is emotional and builds his characters, the other characters - including the \"new\" Gamora (Saldana) - somehow seem to not have as much to do, or somehow just a little off. The \"bad guy\" they're out to defeat is The High Evolutionary (Iwuji), who has undefined powers, but needless to say, likes experimenting on animals trying to perfect evolution.There's some cameos, another good soundtrack (including a nice call-back in the mid-credits scene), top-notch CGI and some funny moments throughout. But for all the good moments, they're almost balanced with not-quite-right parts - the melancholy version of Radiohead's Creep that sets an odd tone, Rocket's whole arc, the organic space station, the High Evolutionary's mask, Gamora's character, Warlock's near pointlessness and the inevitable ending.

Even in the future I have no hope that anything they churn out will be worth our time as an audience. With 20+ movies and 10+ shows to keep up with, its not worth the effort. But just this once, with GOTG 3, James Gunn has done the improbable and made an excellent ending to the Guardians Trilogy. Satisfactory in every manner possible, from action to emotions, from comedy to VFX everything is top notch.The film is a perfect Guardians adventure. It does not stick to one location or premise for too long. For me, the second film got stuck in one location and sort of died out. This one, keeps moving and is equal parts hilarious, entertaining and exhilarating at the same time. That's a perfect GOTG adventure in my book. Having played the game as well, this sort of has a similar tone and feel to that somehow and the game too was an awesome ride.So, coming back to the film, this movie deals with the fallout of Gamora not quite being the Gamora as the person we knew is dead and this one is a past version with less experience and more trauma to deal with. Peter's reaction to her presence is a film in and of itself. Its not boring, but a silly rom com sort of treatment littered throughout the film. The main plot line is about one of the major Guardian's past and is poignant and tragic.Its difficult to go into any sort of details about the film without going into spoiler territory. So lets just say, if you liked the first Guardians film and know of their story so far, then this is a must watch film.Good movies often have short reviews, but there is nothing more to say than, its an amazing film, do go and support it so that Marvel knows what sells and what doesn't.Rating : 9.5/10.

This film was about everything I wanted it to be. It was very emotional and deep in a much different manner then I expected. I teared up more then once while watching this film. This is without a doubt the best looking MCU film in a while. The cinematography is amazing! The CGI/green screen is excellent! I didn't detect a single flaw with what they were able to achieve in that category. The action sequences were very well executed, especially one where all the Guardians are fighting together and it looks like it's all one take. The flashbacks involving Rocket's past were very difficult to watch. Very emotional and dark. What made it work really well was not the voice acting but how they made Rocket look and how they treated him. The stakes were never higher in any other Guardians movie but this, which made the intensity and emotions all pay mush well together. The humor worked very well, which can be hard for a film that is very emotional. James Gunn's direction and style made it all work. As for flaws, I found the villian weak as I couldn't connect with him whatsoever. I just didn't care about him and found him pretty useless. Will Poulter plays Adam Warlock and he's very good. It's just that the character is extremely underutilized. I thought there would be a lot of him in this film but there's actually not and they didn't really know what they were doing with him. There's also some plot holes where exposition was required in certain scenes, which is never a good thing. Besides that, this was a really good movie that I absolutely enjoyed from start to end. It's also very fast paced. This film moves and not a single scene drags. Is it the best Guardians movie?

This one made me feel.... Really let down and wanting more.I did enjoy the more serious tone in parts - especially how Quill felt more like an anti-hero and hardened from all his losses, Nebula and Rocket were very well written, and how it felt like genuine closure for many of the characters stories, but for me that was kind of it.First it felt like the characters, specially Drax/Nebula/Mantis didn't like each other for most of the film (which was strange as the whole thing is set up to be protecting one of their own) and Adam Warlock was SUPER underwhelming - really felt more his whole point of existence was to save Quill in the end. And I get they wanted to make Drax more of a parent in this film, but I felt like Gamora in the sense they wanted the old Drax gone and made him knew to the point he's a whole new character. I'm also not sure how to feel about Gamora's plot; I liked her roughness but also felt she was too angsty and didn't like anyone; but also Quill felt a little similar to that in Guardians 1, so maybe to show how the ravagers affected them and their childhood traumas.The humour was definitely different too, but was unsure how much of it was genuinely funny or not. Also the amount of fake out deaths (like seriously both Drax and Nebula should have died more than once but are miraculously healed scenes later) was really strange, cause James Gunn is a great writer where that isn't needed. The soundtrack was good for the most part, but where in between kidnapping Kevin Bacon and Tony Stark's funeral did Quill learn about \"Creep\" but more importantly \"The Dog Days are Over\"? Do not get me wrong I adore both Radiohead and Florence Welsh but it felt like my own spotify shuffle going from 90's to 70's to 80's to 2000's....I will say too - the multiple shots of animal abuse was definitely not needed. I get Rocket had a super traumatic upbringing, but seeing animals with robotic parts or destroyed in a chamber felt very excessive.

I liked the first two Guardians movies and I think James Gunn is a really skilled director with movies like The Suicide Squad. He is good at making really entertaining movies with a lot of heart and emotion in the mix. He is also good at delivering jokes with his dark sense of humor. Lately, Marvel movies haven't really been my thing since Avengers Endgame. I enjoyed Shang Chi and really liked Spider Man No Way Home, but the others such as She Hulk, Ant Man and the Wasp Quantumania have been mediocre in my opinion. So I was really hoping that Guardians 3 would bring back my love for Marvel. Unfortunately, and I'm a bit sad to say this, it didn't. However, it was definitely one of the better films of Phase 4-5. It was certainly better than Quantumania but with the quality of Marvel these days, it was a let down. I really wanted to love this movie but there is so much going on in the film that I thought it was quite messy and uneven at times. Especially with the first act, the pace was slow and I found it hard to get into the story. The humor was also surprisingly weak and wasn't as well delivered as the first two. With the dark tone of the film, the jokes didn't blend in as well as the first two did. In films like this, and stories like this, we need those parts of levity but the jokes didn't land most of the time and it wasn't really funny, considering that it is a film from James Gunn also written by him. Nevertheless, there were some jokes that were kind of humorous but it didn't make me laugh out loud like some of the jokes in Vol 1 and 2. It's not that I didn't like everything in the movie, there are some parts I loved about it but it definitely leans heavier on the disappointing side. The aspect of the film I liked the most was Rocket's origin story, how he was tortured and experimented on by the villain, The High Evolutionary played by Chukwudi Iwuji who I thought was excellent with his debut role in the MCU. This storyline added the weight and emotional beats to the film very well, giving stakes to the characters and a sense of urgency. The main highlight of the film for me was Bradley Cooper as Rocket. This was definitely his best performance as this character. Some of the sequences in this film were really dark and intense. It gave so much more depth to Rocket and made the film a lot more investing for me. There were some emotional scenes that really tugged at my heartstrings quite a bit. The High Evolutionary was truly a terrible person and the things he does to Rocket and his friends introduced in the film was really messed up and horrible. But that is what I wanted in a Marvel movie for a long time, a terrifying villain that you hate so much, you just want to see the heroes take him/her down in the most badass way. They don't need to have an entire backstory or motive to make a compelling villain as long as he/she is menacing and a real threat to the plot and I think Iwuji delivered it well. The scenes with him were uncomfortable and frightening and that is when you know the capability of this actor. Speaking of new characters, Lylla the Otter, one of Rocket's old friends, was a standout considering how lovable this character was with the small amount of screen time she had. Adam Warlock, played by Will Poulter, was fine. He occasionally showed up from time to time to inflict harm in the movie. The scenes with him were mostly played for laughs since this character is portrayed as having child-like traits, not knowing his purpose in this life he doesn't know much about. I thought the action sequences with Adam gave some of the more exciting parts in the film. Although he does something essential near the end of the movie, this character felt a little under utilized throughout the film. The heart of the Guardians movies rely on the characters the most, especially the main team, Peter, Gamora, Drax, Nebula, Mantis, Groot and Rocket. Besides Rocket, the standout members of the team were Peter, Drax and Nebula, played by Chris Pratt, Dave Bautista and Karen Gillan. These four actors/actresses I felt carried this movie. Through Pratt's performance, you understand Peter's desperation, having lost his mother, father and lover, to save Rocket as he cares about the Guardians of the Galaxy more than anything. Bautista brought the heart and humor the most with Drax who continues to be one of my favorite characters of the Guardians trilogy. Lastly, Gillan who plays Nebula in the film really portrayed the character's growth from the first Guardians movie well and shows how much she understands the depth of the character. It also shows how much James Gunn cares about these characters and tries his best to flesh out the Guardians as much as he possibly could. Since Gamora isn't the Gamora we knew from the first two Guardians movies but instead a new version of this character from Endgame who doesn't remember all of the events of the previous films. I found this to be a flaw because the character that has been built up until Infinity War was erased and none of that mattered in this movie. Instead, Gamora was written as an angry character who slowly gets used to being with the Guardians by the end of the film which I thought wasn't as strong as it could've been. Groot and Mantis were just fine. Not much has changed and they remain to be who they were from the previous films. The reveal in the Holiday Special that came out on Disney Plus last year about Mantis being Peter's sister did help with some of the dialogue said in the film but didn't affect the story that much. Same with Kraglin and Cosmo played by Sean Gunn and Maria Baklava were also utilized just fine in the film. They had a purpose to be in the film and nothing much has changed about them. The film started to pick up with its pacing the most in the second act all throughout to the third act which I thought was the best portion. Some of the action that takes place in the final battle were some of the best action sequences Marvel has ever put out. The ending of the film, with this being the last time this group of Guardians together, was also fine. I liked how the trailers misled me into thinking the film was going to play out in a certain way when the actual film was going to play out differently. Although I had no problems with the ending they chose to do in the final product, I wished that there were more consequences to the Guardians instead of taking a more safe approach, after seeing how dark the film turned out to be. Overall, my consensus of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 3 is although story wise, it was better than Vol 2 and some of the Marvel projects that have come out recently, I think the execution of it could have been handled a bit better with a more organized story instead of having to juggle and balance many characters at once. Nevertheless, I found it to be a satisfying end to the Guardians trilogy by James Gunn and I am curious to see where they take these characters in the future. 7/10.", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 5}, "heading": "Gotg Vol 3", "date": "2023-05-05T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9033928", "sentiment score": [0.0074, 0.144, 0.5106, 0.3182, 0.0198]}, {"content": "Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a fantastic film that stands out as the best of the series. Director James Gunn manages to combine sweetness with viciousness to create a well-rounded movie that is both exciting and emotional. Despite the film being a bit overstuffed, it still provides a refreshing break from the post-Endgame slump in the franchise.Gunn's sadistic side is prominently featured in the movie, and it adds a layer of depth to the characters and storyline.

It is a messy finale that can feel aimless at times, and the heavy themes of loss and terror can make it an odd, lumbering patchwork of a film.Overall, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is an excellent addition to the series and a must-watch for fans of the films.

Rocket takes the spotlight but everybody else is great as well, both antagonist and protagonist.Second half is chaotic, but I loved it. The movie in general is very emotional but packed with great action as well, with most of it in the last third of the movie.

The plot is loaded with so much goodness it's hard to pick apart much of anything.-Strong underlying ties pick apart most characters, and help address and develop them to a classy, but fun way that had me hooked.-It wrapped itself up in comedy and other quirks, but never lost sight of the goals or focus of a character plot and it was amazing to see that happen.-And then to have a fantastic set of climaxes, to utilize old and new and handle it with such grace and yet crude fun, almost unheard of in these days.--And to keep things mixed up and constantly engaging... Gunn nailed it with the direction and writing to tie so much into a rather strong narrative that did not get lost in culture or political agendas. Wow.The Music\n-Holy crap was this fun as ever. Guardians is always known for music and again they succeeded in picking a track list to fill the movie with.-The movie is of course homage to some of the most recognizable and daring songs, with variety that works to keep things dynamic and fun.-But yet, the movie again uses the music to so many levels. Comedy, a buzz vibe with action, and that perfect montage/image idea that feels like a PR shot of the characters\n-Such combinations and balance, I absolutely loved its use and had a wonderful time with the selection and its use again just being that grade A pick.The Special Effects\n-It's an investment in things that show how realistic you can make these make believe worlds come to life and look so polished and good.-Guardians takes this wonderful blend of real life tricks of the trade with computers and giving you the best of both worlds.'It's beautiful and adds that balance that will help age the movie well, and I feel that this just made so much come to life.-Those on animation blended things incredibly, capturing anatomy and physiology to a degree and helping add more to the shimmer of the movies\n-And then comes the action moments that are gorgeous and capture to the point of getting the whole shot in the best light and not losing too much in the chaos camera as I call it.-It was so much fun, and unlike others, did not get lost too much in the over CGI that it became cheesy to separate the lines between reality and fake.The Heart\n-It's been a long time since I've been moved by a movie and even longer since a Marvel movie did it for me, but GOTG 3 did it well.-I did not cry, but man did I feel it so hard in watching things unfold and the relative plots come to life with my characters.-This film hits a lot of deep topics but never to the point of losing the pace and adventure aspect, timing it to make the most opportune moments to share, and then bringing it to the full moment b putting the resolution in the story.-So much depth and the fact comedy is there to help relieve things without ever losing touch of that core character, you just don't get that quality of balance in a lot of movies.-Perhaps one of the best stories to come out of the MCU...ever.The Character Usage\n-And this isn't a movie that is gauged to just one character like they often try to do.-No, GOTG for me uses the characters extraordinarily well, and balancing them all to give the means of inclusion in the movie.-Star Lord has an Arc, Gamora, Drax, and Rocket all have these deep stories that dive further into the characters than we have seen, each story not fighting for time, but rather finding the right amounts of time to share.-But then they don't bleed into one another, but mix into such a blend that you got the full effects and did not miss anything. It allowed just about everyone to play and I loved just how connected EVERY aspect was.-Even the tertiary characters had good inclusion and chemistry and it all worked so well to continue this gradual evolution of the weird family.The Acting\n-Is this the Oscars? Nope, not even close. And does it touch the performances of some of the DC and Marvel crew? No, it doesn't hit those that some hold to.-What it does do well though... is bring these performances that again make the comic book crew come to life and continuing to make me invest into the characters for another go.-The conveyance of hurt, the delivery of lines, the mannerisms and the swag that comes with these characters and it really made me think of this being op acting skill in the Marvel group, or at least one of them.Iwuji is a fantastic villain that is arrogant, boastful, brash, and theatrics to make you hate him, or depending on your morals love him, and make this very binding villain.-Pratt does his job well and gives Quill some bite, charm, and a wonderful balance that is fun and still his character, but not overwhelming.-But Cooper... man does Cooper give one of the best hits for me. Touching, but fun,, deep and yet not overdramatic, and I just loved how well he brought everything to the mix. What a performance.-It works everything together and gives you such dynamic chemistry that I don't have enough room to keep it going.The Comedy\n-It's Guardians, it has to be funny. Again, the mission is accomplished and in a manner that was very balanced for me.-I said it earlier, but when you put comedy in tune with the story, pacing, and mood, you find me very impressed with it being added as a device.-Then you bring in the timing that is so well, and you find these ridiculous surprises hitting you at the right moments.-Add the nearly R rated moments that come into play, and Gunn's attitude with a leash really accomplished a lot in use, necessity, and fun.-It was all done quite amazing to the point it was nearly perfect for me, and kept me laughing the whole time at the dynamic spread that we got.The Pace\n-Was incredible, an entertaining bout of everything at a pace that was balanced and respectful to the story and adventure.-Fast to keep things moving and getting to the end, yet slow enough to stay on the story and give the buildup and emotion the full effect it needs.-I loved the depth of it all and not once did I feel bored or the movie too bloated as I was timing the pace of the movie.The Surprises\n-The movie has lots of predictable things, but the movie throws in some intergalactic tricks to really keep you on your toes.-Changes in the plot are some of the biggest lines crossed and surprised, whilst the levels Gunn goes to convey the danger of this man are quite a shocker.-You'll find that the movie really has some things to mix up the formula and make a Marvel movie feel fun and exciting again.DISLIKES:Sometimes A Tad Too much Comedy\n-It's rare, but this is a comedy central series so you can expect Gunn to cross the lines a few times.-The idiotic moments are some of the stale moments, while other times it's a running joke that has run too far for my liking.-Caution to those with younger people who don't want cursing, heavy insults, and some demoralizing moments as they are present in this film.Some More Graphic Stuff\n-This movie also is a bit more mature than you might expect and not in the indirect way that they used to do.-The third installment of the movie does overstep some things and hit a more mature feel that you might not expect. It's violence alone will cause some to turn away, while the graphic nature and design feel like only a censor shy of belonging to HBOMax.-And some moments with the animal cruelty and darker moments were a bit harder to watch and excessive, but the story component helps blunt that a bit.A Little More Action Early On\n-The movie actually works well to build up action and give it some gusto, but I won't lie that I found it again geared towards comedy and not the action fest the trailers promised.-A little more of the end game's battle, (which was amazing) in a few earlier battles would have perfected this and given me just the right balance in this category.-Fortunately, there is so much other things that even this is a smaller dislike, though again there are still moments I would have done to help maximize the potential.The VERDICT:\nGuardians of the Galaxy was Gunn's love letter to the series and he did it super well for me in showing that comic book movies still have some potential. It took so much pressure and made a diamond, a star amidst most of the modern that was an adventure I was hoping for. It's fun, funny, exciting and just full of the comic book feel I come to the movies for and escaping the madness of the modern day. But that doesn't mean it has lost the real factor that comes with the MCU and that makes for a deeper film that respected the characters built, the stories made, and further dives into them to make such a spectacle. I loved so much of the balance in it and the way they got the Galaxy running again. Sure, it is going to be debatable on the violence, graphicness, and darker tones and there is some fine tuning that could be done. But in the current state of Marvel, it shined for me and is worth a trip to the theater definitely.

By the end of the film you will come to hate this character with a burning passion.Marvel has always being criticized for its villains, but it is my unmovable opinion that not only is most of the criticism unfounded, but also this trilogy has amazing villains, with one very notable exception.Will Poulter joins the cast as the ever-powerful Adam Warlock, in the comics he is one of the most formidable beings in the universe, and when this movie introduces him we get to see the extent of his might as he neutralizes the Guardians almost without breaking a sweat, and if the rest of the story had continued in that direction, the film would have been perfect, but unfortunately it did not.The rest of this entry turns Adam into an immature character, a child that didn't completely grow inside the cocoon he was made in, they turned him almost into the comic relief.We have been waiting for Adam Warlock since he was teased in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, and it was a huge disappointment. Will Poulter did everything he could with the character, but it seems the filmmakers did not know what to do witch such a powerful being, which is shameful.Overall the movie is very enjoyable with a few problems that unfortunately stand out enough to be noticed.

For instance, when Rocket is breaking his friends from the jail, the High Evolutionary predicts the whole maneuver and is able to stop it from happening. After Lylla is murdered and Rocket's raging spree on Chukwudi's character ends, some guards arrive and shoot him, but miss all bullets. Now, overly critical people may think that this is nonsense, after all \"how trained guards can miss a stopped target?\" But seconds later it's revealed that they were not going for 89P13, but for Teeths and Floor - on one of the most heart breaking scenes from the whole MCU. In fact, all flashback scenes are heartbreaking: if you like Rocket, it's impossible not to cry at least once. The sad soundtrack on these sequences are the cherry on top.Another example is: at the beginning of the movie, on Knowhere, Rocket is seen testing a pair of anti-gravity boots while walking upside-down on a ceiling. This is an instance of the Chekhov's Gun, a cinema principle which states that everything that appears during the plot (or at least everything that is emphasized) must have a practical use before the end - and in fact this is the gadget that our favorite Raccon uses to defeat the High Evolutionary on the final standoff, since his powers relies solely on gravitational manipulation.The fight scenes are beautiful and well coreographed, specially the hallway one which is similar to Harley Quinn's escape from prision on Suicide Squad or the Peacemaker's team vs. The butterflies one in the DC series.The jokes are also way more adult then the past movies' ones. Expect no \"eat my hammer\" or \"it's never too late to stop being a dick\"! The first funny moment is Groot misunderstanding Drax when he asks for Mantis to \"touch Pete\" in order to \"make him feel good\", and it dictates the characteristic sarcastical humor from the director. The scene where Quill tries to confess his feelings for Gamora using a private communication channel without knowing that it was actually the open one, and then how all characters seemingly agree that it's \"intuitive\" how the buttons work was also great. Not to mention when he apparently flirts to Ura (portrayed by gorgeous Daniela Melchior) all the way just to reveal his true intentions in the end - after all, his heart belongs to Gamora!The drama shows how James Gunn also improved from the first Guardians movie, and how his new works are true emotional rollercoasters. Like mentioned before, every flashback scene from Rocket and the one which he meets Lylla in heaven right before getting ressurrected are truly devastating. Not to mention his character development, that went from \"why would you wanna save the galaxy\" (on the first movie) to risking his life to save a bunch of irrational species.Guardian's story closes out perfectly.

It seems that for every good project, there's three or four bad ones and even the good ones are just decent at best. But this was an exception because I love James Gunn and I love the first two Guardians movies and my expectations were basically \"Marvel is tanking recently and this could very well be a disaster but Marvel needs a super serious film with mature themes and one where the director and cast care about making a good film.\" I am pleased to report that Guardians Of The Galaxy 3 is a bright spot in the MCU and is most certainly the best MCU film since Avengers: Endgame back in 2019.This isn't your typical Marvel film. And I'm not just saying that like it's shot like a real movie or it has some actual substance this time around, I'm talking about the tone here. I love it. I love everything about it. This is easily the most serious film in the MCU along with The Winter Soldier movie. Since this is the last time we're seeing a lot of these characters in the MCU, there's a certain vibe the film has where anyone could die which means the stakes are higher than ever.As mentioned earlier, the film is shot amazingly well and has some genuinely powerful emotional moments (a particular flashback scene is in my mind. If you've seen the film, you know what I mean.) As well as having some of the best acting in the MCU, an amazing soundtrack as expected, well handled action sequences, crispy sound design and a perfect balance between funny and serious.As for issues, there was a scene at a weird facility thing with Nathan Fillion that could've either been cut out or greatly shortened. Also, some of the editing and timing of the shots was a bit weird as well as some shaky cam in the action sequences. There's also one big thing but it's a massive spoiler so here we go.I'm quite surprised none of the Guardians characters died and I feel like they should've killed off Rocket Raccoon as him dying here would've made perfect sense. He is arguably the most tragic character in the entire MCU franchise and it could've led to the single most powerful scene in Marvel movie history if he died. Could he die later down the line in another movie? Absolutely. Could it still be a strong emotional moment? Undoubtedly but I think this would've been the perfect spot to end his story but that's just me.So yeah, this might be my last MCU movie and I'm happy to say it ended with satisfaction. I honestly can see a fourth Guardians movie happening and from the way it ended, it definitely seems possible. I think a fourth movie would be cool but it has to be handled with care and needs to have the same emotional pull that the previous movies had and it needs to feel necessary. We've had fourth films in beloved franchises that didn't work out well.

Watching his \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\" is to see a director who knows how to balance corporate needs with personal blockbuster filmmaking. This sci-fi/action/comedy still succumbs to a few of the MCU issues of late, but there's a creativity to the filmmaking, dialogue, and performances that modern superhero movies often lack. Gunn is like that kid who is not only playing with his action figures; he's pulling them apart and smashing them back together to make them into new creations. He doesn't just love these losers, he wants to see them save the universe again. Rocket Racoon (voiced by Bradley Cooper) listens to \"Creep\" by Radiohead, a tone-setter that teaches him that he is special. The movie is filled with clever needle drops, making it a tone-setter. The Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) and Rocket (Chukwudi Iwuji) are attacked by the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). Rocket takes the worst beating and hovers near death for most of the movie, putting the film on two tracks: a flashback to Rocket's origin story and the present-day tale of the Guardians trying to save him. The mission leads them to the High Evolutionary, a mad scientist who created Rocket years ago. \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\" is most appealing when it defies a \"product over art\" aesthetic by being clunky and weird. It's thrilling to see Gunn push through some of his unsettling creature designs or settings that feel like they're taking place in actual physical spaces instead of the bland CGI that makes superhero movies look like watching someone else playing a video game. There's a version of \"Vol. 3\" that's even more chaotic and personal, but every time this blockbuster felt like it was edging more to content than art, it won me back. The flashback/mission structure of \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\" sometimes drains the film of momentum, but it does so with Gunn's personality intact. It is a reminder that the best blockbusters don't just sing along to a well-known tune like \"Creep\"; they make the song their own. Gunn would say that this makes us all special too.

Thank you. You inspire me to want to act, you inspire me to want to write and direct, and you inspire me to embrace my creativity and the artist within me. My eyes were glued to the IMAX screen from start to finish, even after having watched the entirety of the first 2 movies as part of a Guardians Marathon in theaters. The stakes were unbelievably high and they just kept increasing in severity. Right off rip we are thrust into a life threatening circumstance with the arrival of Adam Warlock and Rocket's imminent death. Peter is seen drowning his sadness of losing Gamora with alcohol, a parallel to how his buddy Thor was handling his awful life situation. Things were not looking good for the Guardians at all.On top of all of that, quite possibly the MCU's most ruthless, hate-able villain was about to be introduced. If you had any plan of withholding tears during the movie, bring the box of tissues. You're going to need it. Through exploring Rocket's past, we are exposed to how awful he and the other animals were treated during the High Evolutionary's dangerous experiments. We have to sit there and watch all of Rocket's friends, Lylla, Teefs, and Floor be gunned down right in front of him as he attempts to break them out. Everything from hearing his younger voice to seeing him as a baby set the perfect stage for emotional connection to one of the Guardians' most important members.How did they manage to make the rating for this movie PG-13? They did abide by the 1 F-word rule, but the violence was intensely gruesome, which I loved. Heads being chopped off, faces being ripped off, and action sequences that were some of the best the MCU has ever seen. With how some projects have been leaning into the \"Marvel fatigue\" that people talk about, this film is by far one of the most ambitious with its choices. It dares to be different, but also gives us that true Guardians of the Galaxy vibe that we all love, something that Quantumania failed to do.The one small thing that I will say that bothered me was Gamora's character and how I wish they would've gone just a little bit further with some of the emotional moments. Gamora stopping to tell Peter that she \"bets they were fun\" had me about to be a complete wreck, but then it felt like they took the foot off that gas. She stays stubborn til the end, which I can respect, but maybe just had wishfully thinking that she would come around. I'm just happy that no one of great significance dies, and that the LEGENDARY STAR LORD WILL RETURN! One of my favorite characters in the MCU for sure. Thank you James Gunn.Amendment: My score needs an amendment. This was a perfect movie. Better than the original Guardians? I'm at least open to that idea, but for now I'm going to say no. The way they used Gamora's character grew on me and her \"I bet we were fun\" successfully broke me. They handled her character arc so meticulously and, as I said in my original review, maybe it was just wishful thinking that they would've had her come around fully at the end in some way. I think the first time around I was dealing with the fact that it was the 3rd movie of the night of a 7 and 1/2 marathon that ended at 2:30 AM, I was preparing myself for the biggest presentation of my corporate career, and I was still trying to emotionally recover from having to experience Yondu's death again.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 58, "votes": 90}, "heading": "Thank you James Gunn.", "date": "2023-05-04T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9032502", "sentiment score": [0.0241, 0.0798, 0.1991, 0.4523, 0.2447]}, {"content": "It's been so long since we've had a good Marvel movie .

We only half way to 2023, but this movie is so good and it deserved to win few movie awards. I'm not sure what is the secret, most probably James Gunn's touch together with amazing cast.Few moments that are highlights for me in this movie:\n1. Nebula character development arc is second to none. From a sadistic villain to anti hero then we get a chance to really love her as our hero is very amazing feeling. If you enjoyed, Loki's character development, trust me, Nebula's character arc is much better.2. Starlord finally get his closure to let go the traumatic experience he had about Gamora's death (we knew this from holiday special GOTG), and that is what the character needed as his character book end.3. Rocket's back story that is really sad and heart broken. His team (apart from Nebula I guess because she spend time with rocket when the Thanos blip occurs) doesn't know that much about rocket's history and origin and they all really touched about what rocket has went through all this while until he became what he is now.4. Adam warlock spectacular introduction, complete with his own character development included in this one film. Since we all know Drax will be gone (the actor will left the franchise), I can say Adam is perfect as Drax's replacement, both as the new team's muscle and funny moments.5. Gamora is really bad ass in this movie, very menacing, in the same time she actually looking for her own identity in this movie, since she was the past Gamora, and she didn't have that much experience with the gotg team in their previous movies. However, unplanned, she actually did few scene that act as pay offs or Easter eggs that relates to vol 1 and 2, which really something and clever thing to do.6. As I said in previous point, there is so much pay offs and Easter eggs that related to previous movies, which are something a true fan will enjoy. Bear in mind there is not much Easter eggs that is related to non GOTG movies(the one when they appeared on infinity war, end game and Thor 4), but the continuity of Gamora's death is still included together the bond that been developed on Nebula and rocket.7. Each of the character, even side characters like Kraglin and Cosmo got significant role into their story plot not just a filler or cameo. Their appearance wasn't forced, but seems natural and that what makes it perfect for me.That's my take on the film.

I like how they handled the characters and the story was good. I loved a lot about it, almost every part of the movie. The Coolest scene for me is when the Guardians meet up again and everyone fights on the ship. And I love that Rocket finally used his comic accurate name Rocket Raccoon. And I Also love the fact that King Groot is in it! And there's so much stuff I like with the movie. I can't go over everything. One of the strongest parts of the movie is Rocket's backstory and When his friends got shot, it wasn't the fact that They got shot that almost made me cry, it was his reaction to it, just standing there screaming and then slashing The High Evolutinary was just icing on the cake. We all thought somebody would die, but we had wrong and I'm happy that everyone survived, but what died was the Guardians team we all know and love, they disbanded and I love the ending for all of them. I will just go over some of the negatives now. So the first negative I have is that there was way too many fake-outs, I think everyone in the team had atleast one fake-out death and it became kinda annoying When I felt sad because I was afraid for a character to die but then they survived, as I said I'm happy all survived but the fake-outs kinda became a bit annoying. The other negative is more of a question, where was Star-Lords mask and rocket boots during the movie? They were just gone and they would've been really helpful in some scenes. I hope that we get to see them when he returns. That leads into my third and final negative, that is that in the final post-Credit scene, the scene itself is really good, but then we see the text \"The Legendary Star-Lord will return\" and I got kinda confused since we just saw him taking a break and retire, but I wish the text wasn't there since he retired and it was kinda weird when we just set up that he's retiring and now it says he will return.

Rather, I'm given a film that runs way too long, a forgettable villain, and way too much Marvel special effects. It's at the point where I'm running out of reasons to see more MCU movies. I'm not only leaving this review because of the emotional impact it had on me but because I feel Marvel has let them selves down with composition, story telling and the want for me as the audience to submerse myself I've been anticipating this film for so long maybe my expectations were too high, but I didn't like much about it.

Kraglin (Sean Gunn) has been training Cosmo the Spacedog (Maria Bakalova) while practicing with Yondu's whistling arrow. Nebula (Karen Gillan), Groot (Vin Diesel), Rocket (Bradley Cooper), Drax (Dave Bautista), and Mantis (Pom Klementieff) - revealed to be Peter's half-sister in the Holiday Special - have been carrying out renovations, while Peter (Chris Pratt) spends his days listening to music and drowning his sorrows, still mourning the loss of Gamora. Yes, she's still alive thanks to past time-travel shenanigans, but she's not the woman he loved.In a charming opening sequence, Rocket strolls around the city listening to Radiohead's 'Creep' - a song with poignant, albeit obvious links to his character with lyrics like, 'I want a perfect body, I want a perfect soul.' Suddenly, he's speared by a Super-Saiyan blur: it's Adam Warlock (Will Poulter), an ultra-powerful \"effigy\" of the Sovereign ordered to recover the \"squirrel\" for the High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji), a super-powered madman hellbent on creating the \"perfect species.\"Suffice to say, things don't go to plan for Adam or the Guardians, and it puts them on a collision course with the High Evolutionary in order to save Rocket's life. Of course, they'll need Gamora's help along the way.Marvel movies have been rightfully slapped with memes and mockery about their tropes, like undercutting emotional moments with feeble, \"so, that just happened\" attempts at humor - but Guardians 3 is an exception, mostly on account of it actually being funny. The laughs don't feel cheap, and quips that don't connect aren't left to linger. Gunn also indulges his more macabre sensibilities, mining giggles from all sorts of wanton carnage.The cast has never been better: Pratt and Saldana's chemistry is sparkly and moving, Klementieff and Bautista remain the trilogy's best pairing, and Gillan's Nebula is perfectly pitched, especially after rocky beginnings. Cooper, once again, completely disappears into Rocket, and in years to come it'll be revered as one of the best voice performances we've ever had.Rocket has been at the forefront of the marketing, for good reason. We won't spoil anything, but we'll say this: he may have the most heartbreaking origin story in the MCU - as Nebula says, it's \"worse than what Thanos did to her.\" Any and all scenes that flashback to his past are among the most emotionally potent, overwhelming moments in the film; there's cruelty on display, but the brutality isn't manipulative.Some may feel the rest of the movie is a bit messy. It's the longest movie in the trilogy at two-and-a-half hours, but for my money, there wasn't a single bum note, thanks to character being at the core of all of Gunn's storytelling. The runtime and narrative hopscotching are clearly structured to give everyone their moment to shine, but they all work. It's all satisfying and, importantly, true to who they are, where they've been, and where they're going.John Murphy is on composer duties this time, taking over from Tyler Bates. While there's nothing quite on the same goosebump-raising caliber as 'Groot Spores', 'Dad', or even their main theme, it's a strong score that compliments another impeccable soundtrack.

The way how it is edited takes me out of the moment and the tension, it makes clear that rocket is going to be alright, because why else would there be this much of emotional build-up just for him to die on the table.The first half does something really good with the humor, it turns serious moments or non-sense moments into funny scenes, marvel has tried this for a lot of times, but for the first time, it works. Humor is subjective, but for me it is the best when it comes randomly or not expected, and even the second half, has some gruesome humor, especially the monkey scratching off the woman's face.The second half is not as good as the first one, what I liked about this movie was not the premise, or the idea, it was simply the execution of its moments, the heist in the first half was great, Adam warlock's moments were great, especially the one where he burns the ravager, but the overall plot, is typical marvel formula. While the first half lays back from that and just let it's moments flow, the second turns back to that and forces a climax out of the plot.The climax could've completely been resolved on the counter-earth, it lasted so long and I reached a moment where I thought why should I be interested in seeing what happens now? The villain is going to be defeated, everything is going to be good, teaser for the next movies, happy ending. I know that is the marvel formula, but nobody can tell me that this is enjoyment, it's time to change that, the climax is the most important part of a movie, if that doesn't do something with you, then the movie simply is not worth your time. What would've been other Science-fiction classics without what they do in it's climax? It would've been an unfinished puzzle, that's the part where you gather understanding, or tension, or where the idea of a character gets clear.The Actor of the villain embraces everything what Kang in Quantumania needed to be, while his character is predictable and formalistic, the actor gives what he can do with the script. There are moments where he gets insane and uses all of his power, for me, his representation of this character, is the idealistic Kang.Volume 3 is fun, but it has no balance.

This film is again directed and partly written by James Gunn, who also directed the two previous films.Peter Quill (Chris Pratt) is still reeling from the loss of his beloved Gamora (Zoe Saldana). This loss causes him to still not be his old self. During a mission, Rocket (voice of Bradley Cooper) is injured by this.In order to save him, the other Guardians must confront his creator The High Evolutionary (Chukwudi Iwuji). This is a perfectionist, who is always trying to improve everything. It's probably not very familiar to leave Rocket in his hands.With this third film, James Gunn manages to close his trilogy nicely, but he leaves it in such a way that others could continue with the film series. After this film, James Gunn will resign from Marvel and will now continue as an executive for the DC superhero films. If Marvel decides to use the Guardians of the Galaxy for new further films in their film series, this will probably come across differently compared to the vision that James Gunn had with the series and characters.For his latest Guardians of the Galaxy film, James Gunn also takes a different direction for a change, making this film a bit darker and brutal. For example, there are different animals in the film and although these animals are not real in the film, most of them come across as realistic. When these animals are then modified by the villain of the film, who tries to make them more perfect, they show the best violent images in which this is done. These images are not really suitable for young viewers such as children under ten. Parents should take this into account if their children would like to see this film.In addition to the animals, James Gunn, together with the people who worked on the visual effects for this film, also manages to portray the other aliens in different, creative ways. They've done this with both visual and makeup effects. It sometimes seems as if you are watching a Star Wars or Star Trek movie. Unfortunately, all explosions do not always come across as credible, because with some explosions you can see that they are played on a green screen.The acting is also well done by the film cast. For this third film, most of them also get enough opportunities to play their well-known roles in other ways. Chris Pratt comes across as very depressed, especially in the beginning. Because this film plays on Rocket's backstory, Bradley Cooper now voices a younger version of the same character in addition to his now well-known voice as Rocket. With this third film and the events of the past Marvel films, Zoe Saldana now also gets a chance to portray Gamora's character in a different way. This version of Gamora is also a bit more brutal compared to how the character was portrayed in this way less and less in these films. With this film, she gets more of a chance to respond to the title that the character had in the comics: the deadliest woman in the whole galaxy. The rest of the returning cast also portray their characters in good manners, but not all get the chance to do something special with their characters in this new film. The well-known character from the comics Adam Warlock also finally appears in the Marvel film series. He is played by Will Poulter, but otherwise little special is done with the character.

Once again written and directed by James Gunn and starring Chris Pratt, Dave Bautista, Zoe Saldana, Karen Gillan, Pom Klementieff, and the voices of Bradley Cooper and Vin Diesel, it does a serviceable job of adding something new to a waning post-Endgame MCU.Sometime after the events of both \"Avengers: Endgame\" and \"Thor: Love and Thunder\", the Guardians of the Galaxy have each been living quietly as citizens of Knowhere. When Rocket Racoon's (voiced by Bradley Cooper) life is suddenly placed in danger, the Guardians quickly embark on a mission to help him before he is lost forever. Their mission proves difficult for most of the team's members, particularly with leader Peter Quill/Star-Lord (Chris Pratt) still feeling depressed over losing Gamora (Zoe Salda\u00f1a). The Guardians soon realise that Rocket is in more danger than they had anticipated when they learn that the powerful Adam Warlock (Will Poulter) is seeking to destroy them all.Over the past few years, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been going through what I consider to be an \"experimental\" period. With the usual superhero film formula growing a bit stale, it seems like the producers are taking some creative risks as a means to both retain some freshness and hopefully keep audiences invested in the bigger picture. Though these risks have yielded mixed results, I have to give the higher-ups some credit for at least trying something different from what everyone is used to. On that note, the third \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" film is quite a tonal departure from what we've all come to expect from this otherwise light-hearted set of movies, which paves the way for a more downbeat look at this loveable team of heroes.Admittedly, I was apprehensive about seeing these fun-loving characters in such a vulnerable state but by the end I came to appreciate how the film highlighted each of their important human qualities. Someone like Peter Quill, who has been through a rollercoaster of emotional journeys, has certainly needed time to rebuild himself back into the team leader he is supposed to be. He is still overcome with grief at losing Gamora, the woman he loves, and now has the difficult task of winning over her reluctant younger version from 2014. Likewise, we learn that Rocket is reflecting over the traumatic events that turned him into the wise-cracking racoon he is today. Things take a turn for the worst when he is later placed in danger of losing his life, and it is here Rocket discovers how important it is to have friends who care about his general well-being. These are just two examples of what this film chooses to focus around with its characters, and while this may prove disheartening to those expecting the usual frequent laughs, I believe it is all handled reasonably well.For its lengthy runtime of 150 minutes, the film at least keeps things going at a brisk enough pace most of the way through. This is because James Gunn does a decent job introducing us to strange new locations populated with equally strange supporting characters to the point where it is hard for boredom to ever sink in. Despite the film taking a more serious tone, that's not to say it is completely devoid of any humour or wonder. I did find myself chuckling at some of the odd aliens the Guardians interacted with throughout the story and I liked some of the visuals that accompanied the places they visited. One place, as seen in the trailers, resembles an alternate version of Earth, except with animal-like humanoids as its main inhabitants. Though there are a handful of jokes at the expense of these creatures' ignorance, we eventually see that they are not much different from regular people in terms of personality. This is a stark contrast to the excessive use of CGI in place of a story seen in a certain \"Ant-Man\" sequel, which quickly lost my interest as the flashy effects kept piling up.The film's biggest fault, however, is its inability to juggle three contrasting stories playing out at the same time. One features Rocket figuring out who he truly is, the second has the Guardians trying to rescue him, and the last one is the villain hunting everyone down. Without giving away spoilers, I didn't care for the way the film attempted to intertwine these three plots at various intervals, which resulted in some cluttered storytelling. It is especially problematic when you realise that each of the three stories has a completely different tone, ranging from deadly serious to cheerfully funny. If you waver a film's tone too much, it becomes hard to be invested in everything that it going on, and this does happen at certain points. Had the film picked just one of these tones to go with, then it could have made for a more streamlined finale, but instead it all came across as somewhat misguided in its overall execution.Where the film succeeds greatly is in its depiction of the characters we've known and loved for almost nine years now. Chris Pratt's Peter Quill has matured considerably since the last time we saw him, making decisions based on rational thinking rather than emotion. As we saw in \"Avengers: Infinity War\", it was Quill's emotional outbursts that caused things to go wrong for everyone, so it is nice to see that he is in the process of learning from those mistakes. Zoe Salda\u00f1a's younger Gamora is naturally different from her deceased counterpart, given that this version of her is not the one who fell in love with Quill. Since she has no memory of ever loving Quill, we now have to watch them bond all over again from the very beginning. Karen Gillan's Nebula is also more compassionate and caring of what happens to her fellow Guardians members. I assume this is due to her spending an extended amount of time on Earth during the events of \"Avengers: Endgame\", which makes sense since it was there she was treated nicely by the rest of the Avengers.As Mantis, I liked how Pom Klementieff shows a more assertive side to her character. In the past, Mantis has been relatively passive and reluctant to fight, but now she never backs down from a scuffle if the going gets tough. She and Dave Bautista's Drax had their fair share of funny moments, mostly as a result of the latter's lack of intelligence. Anybody who saw \"The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special\" will remember what an amusing duo Mantis and Drax were throughout, and all of that can be found here as well. That being said, Drax is still a vital member of this team in his own right, contributing not only his brawn but the occasional heartfelt voice of reason when the situation calls for it.I won't talk too much about Rocket since most of his scenes venture into spoiler territory but I enjoyed how we learn so much more about him as the story progresses. Rocket has always been an enigmatic character, never revealing any helpful information about his past, so to see this much focus placed on him was a great creative decision. Bradley Cooper definitely shines as the voice of Rocket, injecting a lot of emotion into his performance, which is easier said than done considering he is technically a talking racoon. As for Groot, there isn't much to say except that he's still the Groot we know and love. I mean, you've got to applaud Vin Diesel for his uncanny ability to say \"I am Groot\" with such convincing inflections.However, I think Will Poulter's Adam Warlock was a mixed bag at best. Though I liked how seriously Poulter played the character, there weren't really enough parts in the film that let him to stand out too much. Personally, I blame this on the aforementioned poor choice of having three conflicting stories happening at once but it's also possible this was done as a way to set things up for future MCU events. Regardless, I think Poulter's Warlock was fairly decent, even he didn't leave as much of an impression as I had hoped.When considering the varying quality of post-Endgame MCU content, I would say that \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\" is one of the more interesting entries in this long-running cinematic universe. It may not blow your mind with the usual superhero action nor will it make you frequently laugh with its comic relief, but it should hopefully make you care just enough about its characters to appreciate their evolution over time. With all of that in mind, this film has me cautiously optimistic that the future of the MCU can still be good, even it has seen better days.I rate it 7/10.", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 7}, "heading": "Does a serviceable job of adding something new to a waning post-Endgame MCU", "date": "2023-05-04T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9031931", "sentiment score": [0.0021, 0.0222, 0.2834, 0.654, 0.0383]}, {"content": "I go to the movies not to be subjected this kind of emotional trauma, animal torture is crossing the line!!!!!

It introduces us not only to the raccoon's alt-rock tastes but also the movie's setup.

No one is sidelined. No one is wasted. It is, on top of its main plot, a break-up movie about the hollow feeling of bumping into an ex and realising they've moved on. Although in this case Star-Lord (Pratt, reminding us that he can be extremely charming when the role calls for it) is having to deal with the fact that his ex, Zoe Salda\u00f1a's Gamora, is actually an alternate-universe version with no memory of him.The Guardians of the Galaxy series going out on a story about potentially sacrificing everything to spare one of your own is the trilogy at its most compelling.

Don't get me wrong, it's not an earth-shattering masterpiece by any means, but its clever humor, endearing camaraderie between its quirky heroes, entertaining use of 80s music, and uniqueness compared to other Marvel films made it a breath of fresh air that many people really enjoyed. The second film was not as good as the first, but still enjoyable enough. Unfortunately, the third film is very disjointed and lacks any semblance of a compelling overarching story to really work. While devoted Marvel fans will probably enjoy it more than I did, I view the film as overall further evidence of the MCU's decline in quality since the Infinity Saga.In this film, the Guardians have to embark on a mission to protect (an injured) Rocket Raccoon from an evil villain, the High Evolutionary. The film alternates between garden-variety CGI/action setpieces and some surprisingly dark flashbacks to Rocket Raccoon's earlier life. Some viewers will be surprised by these flashbacks and find them to be more disturbing than they would expect from a \"Guardians\" movie. I do not think these scenes push the boundaries of the PG-13 rating (\"The Batman,\" for example, contains scenes far more disturbing and graphic,) but parents bringing younger children starting to watch Marvel movies should note that their children could find them upsetting. The juxtaposition between the lighter humor and fun of the Guardians and these more tragic, trauma-based moments does not exactly work very well, since the plot is not compelling enough overall to justify the continued plot progression on both ends. The film's overall story is very generic and forgettable, and significant portions of the film feel surprisingly rather pointless in contributing to the such story. These concerns are intensified by the fact that the third act is pretty weak, and the first two acts don't really build up to it much.The writing and humor are much weaker than the previous two \"Guardians\" films, especially the first one. The comedy here feels surprisingly forced and lazy, rather than genuine and clever. Additionally, at two and a half hours (longer than both of the first two films,) the film's runtime really does overstay its welcome, especially given the relative lack of a consistently compelling plot--or even significant attempts at plot structure. The film still has some mildly entertaining set pieces and a great soundtrack, so it's not a total misfire by any means, but it's very disappointing compared to the previous two \"Guardians of the Galaxy\" films--especially considering how much less than the sum of its parts this film feels. 5.5/10Note: I saw an advance screening of the film in IMAX. The picture and sound quality were very good on the IMAX screen, and the film seemed to use the IMAX-expanded aspect ratio for nearly all of its running time.", "rating": 5, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 117, "votes": 275}, "heading": "A generally disappointing end to the Guardians trilogy", "date": "2023-05-03T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9031360", "sentiment score": [0.0149, 0.3578, 0.5442, 0.0811, 0.0021]}, {"content": "This movie blew me away, as not only is it the best movie in the 'Guardians of the Galaxy' franchise, but it is one of the best MARVEL movies ever made.Every aspect in it works so well and it all culminated in a fantastic event.All of the Guardians are at their best here.

After the thoroughly disappointing Ant-Man & The Wasp: Quantumania, Marvel was in desperate need of a hit, and James Gunn well and truly delivers with Guardians Vol. 3.This is easily the most fun I've had with a superhero film in a long time. It is funny, thrilling, and surprisingly emotional. Fans who have been following these characters for the last 10 years, get ready for such a satisfying and emotional journey.What makes the Guardians so good is that they stand out. Superhero films are becoming far too formulaic and blending into one another, but the Guardians films somehow manage to buck this trend. Sure, the story follows the well trodden superhero film structure at its core and there are lots of familiar cliches and tropes, but the dressing around these things feels vibrant, distinct, and cared for.The characters remain unique and interesting, with great performances behind them all. I was particularly impressed with Pom Klementieff in this film, who steals the show in my opinion with her emotion and humour. All of the performances are great though, with another shout out to Chukwudi Iwuji for a captivating performance.The story is full of emotion, and is quite possibly the most emotional and punchy Marvel film yet. It brought me to tears and I could hear plenty of others in the theatre feeling a similar way! It's also really funny too with so many laugh out loud moments. James Gunn excelled himself with this script in every way.Saying that, I do think some story elements feel a little bit clunky, and some characters are a little surplus to requirements, but these are minor criticisms in the grand scheme of things.The action sequences are well done. They aren't mind blowing, but much more emphasis is put into story and character than action so this isn't necessarily a bad thing.I will also say that despite being two and a half hours this film doesn't feel long at all. It never once drags and every scene feels needed and adds something to the whole picture.Guardians Vol 3. Is fun, emotional, and just a joy to watch.

It also feels like a vital piece of unchecked creativity in a cinematic universe growing increasingly stale.The Guardians films have always stood out within the greater Marvel universe but after the hit and miss nature of phase 4 and phase 5 getting off to a terrible start with Quantumania, it's honestly kinda baffling that this beautiful, proactive and personal movie is even remotely linked to all of that.Chris Pratt is just as strong as before as Peter Quill, there's always been a sadness beneath the charming exterior but after all the previous losses its starting to come to the surface in terrific fashion as he's determined to protect his family this time around. Zoe Salda\u00f1a's performance is a lot different to what's come before, giving this version of Gamora a fresh personality and relationship with the other Guardians.Bradley Cooper as Rocket is the emotional core of this one, so much time is spent exploring his past and it leads to the most emotionally devastating moments and he absolutely brings it. Dave Bautista and Pom Klementieff remain really funny throughout but the film wisely still takes time to offer reminders of their dramatic chops as well.Karen Gillan has only gotten better with each film and gets the most to do in this one. Seeing her grow from antagonist to equal has been one of the biggest and best surprises of the trilogy. Chukwudi Iwuji is an amazing villain, eschewing the usual tortured past of most villains for a character who is just plain evil and larger than life, played to perfection.James Gunn's direction is incredible. He's clearly pushing himself creatively, technically and emotionally throughout to deliver the swansong these characters deserve and its so satisfying to watch. There's also a hallway fight done all in one take that's just one of the most thrilling things in the entirety of the MCU.Definitely worthy of the mention is the CG, which is surprisingly good. Recently that has been on a major downward spiral for which Marvel can only blame themselves for their unreasonable deadlines and inability to plan. Which is why its so nice to see one of these where it looks good throughout, emphasising what can be achieved when these actually have a visionary with a plan.Finally, the music by John Murphy shares more stylistically with The Suicide Squad opposed to Tyler Bates work on the previous 2 but it still remembers to use that iconic theme at the right moment and Awesome Mix - Vol 3 is excellent.

The balance between humour and drama was just right, with the comedy elements fitting in the right moments and the serious moments taking priority when they were needed, not being overshadowed by the humour like in Thor 4. However, some of the jokes did fall a bit flat and felt rather 'typical' for a guardians film, but I still enjoyed these moments as they were characterful as usual. Just a quick note on the age rating for this film, I think it's just outright unacceptable for any film to be rated 12 and contain the 'f' word in, along with other severe profanity. It seems standards in society continue to decrease. Parents, be warned!I liked the story. It felt unique and raw, and held real emotion. I cried in one particular moment as it was so hitting, and that's not something I just do. I find it very hard to be affected emotionally by a film, and this one struck my heart. The meaning behind it is very strong and I love it when a film does that. My only gripe with the plot is as of course with all the other final films in a MCU trilogy is the hole in the theory of the plot which is - where were these villains before? Why have they only now gone after the heroes? Why wait? It seems too sudden, but that's a general problem with a lot of superhero films nowadays, as they become more generic with this formula. I guess maybe the villain just hides in a cocoon all that time and waits for Kevin to come and say 'ok it's your turn now.' It's fine having new villains but the problem with introducing them in a series of twenty odd films where all these characters integrate and crossover to deal with threats is why has it taken this villain so long in particular to show up? This can easily be solved in the script with a simple contextual background for the character. And I felt as though this was missing that necessary context, and so had the overall feeling of randomness. For example, why is Adam only now hatched and being sent after Rocket? Was endgame too early? Heck, even Guardians 2 when they were on the Sovereigns doorstep! Surely Adam would have been in the hatching process by then? If the High Evolutionary was always after Rocket, there's no reason provided why he hasn't been able to do it before. I dunno. Just give some context at the start of the movie. But I think that boils down to James Gunn having to make his trilogy within the confines of the MCU where everything has to be linked and connected and done in order. If James Gunn was allowed to make this trilogy separate, it might have made more sense overall. But because Feige has to have so many films done in one continuous series it has this random feeling to it. But hey, it's a superhero film. We're there to have fun and take nothing too seriously.Which brings me into my second gripe. Adam himself was a very silly character. No infinity stone on his head and yet no explanation to what was in its place? He also had very little to do in this film and just sort of pops up here and there with no real solid importance other than to be there. I felt like he could have been more involved with the action pieces throughout.Was it a good film? Yes, one that I very much enjoyed. Could the story be developed slightly? Of course. But it was a very solid film on its own. How it stands against the previous two, I wouldn't say it was better personally. I think people love to say this is the best film in the MCU since Endgame, well yeah, that's true, because it didn't have much competition in the first place. I mean look at Thor, Doctor Strange, all terrible entries. So Guardians was always going to be better than those because for one thing James Gunn can make a decent film. But it certainly isn't the best MCU film overall and I think the hype is a little carried away.What I will say is that this film has a special power in its emotional intelligence and also in its action sequences. Every punch and blast feels powerful with real raw meaning behind it and the end result is incredibly satisfying. It's not often an action film can do that, but this felt powerful like no other.

The film explores the tragic backstory of Rocket Raccoon through effective use of flashbacks, which adds a layer of emotional depth to the character. This is a movie that is not afraid to be vulnerable, and it is all the better for it.Every single character gets their moment to shine in this film, and it is a testament to James Gunn's skill as a writer and director that he manages to balance all of the characters so well. There are plenty of moments of levity and humor, but there are also moments of heartbreak and tragedy. The film manages to strike a perfect balance between these different elements, which is no mean feat.The music in this film is as great as always, and the soundtrack is a highlight. James Gunn has a real knack for choosing the perfect songs for his movies, and the songs in this film are no exception. The visuals in this film are also stunning, and the movie is a feast for the eyes. The action sequences are expertly choreographed and thrilling to watch, and the special effects are top-notch.I have no negative thoughts on this movie. It is a movie that had me emotionally engaged from start to finish, and it has been a long time since the MCU made me feel like this.

That being said, it's entertaining and I had a good deal of fun watching it... but I can't call it a slam dunk.

The other two movies got the balance right by some screenwriting miracle, and while this could technically feel more unwieldy or unbalanced, it doesn't quite mesh together ideally.There are some really violent scenes. There are some genuinely traumatic and honestly kind of disturbing moments. There are the jokes you'd expect (and they're largely funny). There are some very sad scenes. There are some really corny scenes. All these moments work in isolation, but Vol. 3 is a bit like the best orchestra in the world being led by a conductor who's just rolled out of bed and takes the better part of two and a half hours to wake up.But all those individual elements? If you let them wash over you, they all work extremely well. This is 150 minutes long and doesn't feel it. The pacing largely works, and it's very entertaining.

The entire storyline was filled with repetition and played safe, similar to his previous work on \"Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\".Overall, the film is a lackluster final installment from director James Gunn.

The Guardians are back in a whopping two-and-a-half hours long movie and thankfully, every minute is used with purpose, and nothing goes to waste.Every character in \"Vol.3\" is perfectly incorporated and woven into its complex narrative tapestry.Chris Pratt's Star-Lord might have been the lead of the last two films, but Bradley Cooper's Rocket Raccoon takes center stage this time around. Needless to say, the narrative work done for the character is amongst some of the best in the MCU.It also provides some deeply emotional and disturbing moments as audiences learn the circumstances that created everyone's favorite trash panda...don't say that infront of him.While Rocket was already one of the strongest characters in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, \"GOTG Vol.3\" elevates him even further.This newfound focus on Rocket, however, doesn't ever take the attention away from the rest of the movie's sprawling cast. At no point does it feel like any character or plot point suffers due to the narrative focus clearly landing on Cooper's Raccoon.When it comes to Pratt's Star-Lord, he's having a hard time dealing with the death, and subsequent revival, of his dead lover. Despite the complex emotional situation Quill finds himself in. The character's classic comedic chops are still very much present, as is the case for the humor throughout the film. This time around, the balance between laughs and heavy drama is pitch-perfect.There are three specific characters who all could have had better characterizations and development in the franchise's prior installments - Gamora, Drax, and Mantis. All three are handled superbly, and in many ways, the development they receive here almost makes up for any shortcomings in the past.This new Variant of Gamora feels far more aligned with her moniker of the Deadliest Woman in the Galaxy. Zoe Saldana gives her best performance to date as the character. Drax actually gets to competently fight while also making time to explore his softer side. And Mantis's powers are put to use in unique and clever ways, while she also gains more agency than just simply being a supporting punchline to Drax's many jokes.As for Nebula, her story in \"Infinity War\" and \"Endgame\" gives the former villain a great foundation for \"Vol.3\" to build on. It feels like she's always been a member of the team, and despite her continued elevated anger, that's no longer her singular trait.While previous iterations of the Groot may have come off as gimmicky for many, the version seen in \"Vol. 3\" feels like the most fully realized and elevated form of the character yet.As for the newcomers, the obvious first person to mention would be Will Poulter's Adam Warlock. Teased at the end of \"Vol. 2\" five years ago, the character finally makes his proper entrance. Adam's story is not one that would seem like an organic fit alongside the rest of the narrative. However, Gunn does an incredible job of giving the character just the right amount of screen time without allowing anything to feel forced, unearned, or undercooked. He feels like a nebown child and kinda reminding you Vision in \"Age of Ultron\".Needless to say, the wait for the Russian telepathic dog's arrival is worth the wait. While the role of Cosno in the film isn't much, it's just enough to feel satisfying and really makes audiences excited to see more of Maria Bakalova' s work with the character down the road.Let's talk about the villain...Chukwudi Iwuji's High Evolutionary is one of Marvel's best antagonists, and he gives his all for every second of his screen time. Iwuji's performance perfectly encapsulates the terrifying, maddened evil genius to a tee. He's also impressively brutal at points in the story. While the character is notably changed from his source material, the core aspects of what makes the villain unique are all there. Like all of the best villains, the story makes his motives very clear and skillfully creates his twisted logic behind it all.Not only is the High Evolutionary the best villain in any of the \"GOTG\" trilogy movies, but he belongs in the running for one of the best MCU baddies in general.When it comes to the overall production design of \"Vol.3\" it's just as strong as always. The High Evolutionary's base of operations sports a unique and eye-catching aesthetic, while another space station made entirely of organic matter may be quick to make some squeamish.As for the costumes, the core team's new matching outfits are fantastic. They are wonderfully comic-accurate, and many fans are no doubt thrilled to see Gunn put them on screen before his Marvel departure.Then there's the VFX work, which, for the most part, is astounding. The high quality can easily be noticed during any sequence with a CGI animal-notably any and all of Rocket's backstory.When it comes to this entry's mixtape, the musical selection is just as wonderfully chosen and curated as any of the previous Volumes before.Not only did James Gunn successfully stick the landing for his era-ending story, but he's also gone and created one of the very best movies in Marvel Studios history.It is everything you probably wanted to be and beyond. It is funny, action packed and extremely emotional. You gonna' need tissues for you and your friends and if you has loved all these characters through the years, then the emotions will caught you off guard for sure. This for me is probably the best MCU trilogy, beating the Cap's one for the prize.There are two credit scenes, not five this time...but it will be hard to leave the theatre anyway, so you gonna check them.Extremely emotional and memorable coclusion, which you will want to see with your closest friends.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 4, "votes": 11}, "heading": "Brilliant Conclusion Wrapped In Emotional Damage!", "date": "2023-05-03T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9030422", "sentiment score": [0.0045, 0.0243, 0.0986, 0.5594, 0.3132]}, {"content": "Just came out of the opening night in New Zealand and have to say GOTG3 has to be one of the best movies I've ever seen!

It serves as a fitting farewell to one of the most beloved and distinctive franchises in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Writer-director James Gunn delivers a thrilling, hilarious, and emotional conclusion to his trilogy, as the Guardians face their biggest challenge yet: saving one of their own from a mad scientist who created him.The plot of the film revolves around the Guardians' quest to save Rocket (Cooper), who is revealed to be a genetically engineered experiment by the High Evolutionary (Iwuji), a mad scientist who wants to create a perfect society through eugenics. Along the way, they also have to deal with Adam Warlock (Poulter), a powerful being created by Ayesha (Debicki), the leader of the Sovereign race who seeks revenge on the Guardians for stealing her batteries The film also explores the aftermath of Gamora's (Saldana) death and resurrection and how it affects her relationship with Peter Quill (Pratt).\"The action scenes are well-choreographed and thrilling. The movie skillfully balances action, comedy, and drama while maintaining focus on the characters and their relationships. The cast delivers excellent performances, with Pratt and Cooper delivering heartfelt portrayals of Quill and Rocket, who struggle with their identities and purposes. Saldana and Karen Gillan shine as Gamora and Nebula, whose complicated sisterhood evolves throughout the film. Drax, played by Dave Bautista, delivers some of the funniest lines while Pom Klementieff adds sweetness and charm as Mantis. Vin Diesel and Sean Gunn are also great as Groot and Kraglin, respectively.\"The movie also introduces some new characters who fit well into the Guardians' world. Poulter is impressive as Adam Warlock, who has a conflicted arc that sets him up for future stories. Iwuji is menacing as the High Evolutionary, who serves as a formidable villain and a personal nemesis for Rocket. Maria Bakalova steals every scene she's in as Cosmo the Spacedog, a telepathic Soviet canine who helps the Guardians. Sylvester Stallone also returns as Stakar Ogord, who leads a team of Ravagers that includes Michael Rosenbaum as Martinex and Daniela Melchior as Ura.The movie is visually stunning, with vibrant colors and imaginative designs that bring Counter-Earth and other cosmic locations to life. The cinematography by Henry Braham is dynamic and inventive, capturing the action and emotion with flair. The editing by Fred Raskin and Greg D'Auria is tight and smooth, keeping the pace brisk and engaging. The music by John Murphy is epic and catchy, blending orchestral cues with classic rock songs that fit the tone and mood of each scene.Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 is a satisfying end to an amazing saga that has entertained and moved millions of fans around the world. It is a testament to Gunn's vision and talent, as well as to the chemistry and charisma of the cast.
