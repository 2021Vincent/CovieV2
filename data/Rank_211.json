The movie captures the raw emotions and brutal treatment that Joan endured during her final days, and it's a masterpiece that has stood the test of time.The film is a visual and emotional tour de force, thanks to the incredible direction of Carl Theodor Dreyer and the outstanding performance of Ren\u00e9e Jeanne Falconetti as Joan. The close-ups of Falconetti's face are particularly striking, as they capture every nuance of her performance, from her fear to her faith, and her eventual despair.The film's minimalistic approach to the sets and costumes also adds to the emotional impact, as the focus is entirely on the characters and their performances. This allows the audience to connect with the characters on a deeper level and become more invested in their struggles.Despite being a silent film, The Passion of Joan of Arc's score is also noteworthy, adding an extra layer of depth to the already emotionally charged scenes.In conclusion, The Passion of Joan of Arc is a cinematic masterpiece that will stay with you long after the credits roll. It's a must-see for anyone who loves movies or wants to experience a truly unforgettable film.Ranking: 9/10 \ud83c\udf1fFun fact: The film's original negative was thought to be lost for many years, but a copy was found in a mental institution in Norway in the 1980s.", "rating": 9, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "The Passion of Joan of Arc (1928) - An Intense Masterpiece", "date": "2023-05-07T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw9039451", "sentiment score": [0.0043, 0.0097, 0.0506, 0.4159, 0.5195]}, {"content": "To be honest I only watched it because of it's place in the Top 250 movies list.

That is certainly a great movie, but another film should come to mind, that being Carl Dreyer's 1928 silent masterpiece, The Passion of Joan of Arc.Passion, in its original Latin meaning, means \"to suffer\", and in terms of people like Jesus and Joan of Arc, it also refers to their death. As such, The Passion of Joan of Arc's plot focuses on the trial of Joan of Arc, as a heretic in the eyes of France's Catholic Church, for claiming to be sent by God to save France from England.Even at 94 years old, The Passion of Joan of Arc is one of the most beautiful movies I have ever seen. Director Carl Dreyer, most known for making deeply spiritual films, crafts a memorizing portayal of Joan's trial and ultimate death.Despite it earning a 10, there is a minor complaint I have, which still extends to a positive. The movie runs for 81 minutes, and even then, roughly half of the movie is dialogue free. (Note that it is also a silent film.) We see Joan cry, priests and judges debate, Joan walk to her death, all without speaking. As a result, the movie can feel like a slow burn, as if a turtle could move faster.However, Dreyer films in such a way that there is beauty in these slow moments, such as Maria Falconetti (Joan)'s large eyes flowing with tears. So, despite how slow it is, Passion still manages to keep the viewer overall engaged and moved by the picture.In many ways, her death mirror's that of Christ's, as she is put on trial for heresy, spit on, wears a crown likened to the crown of thorns (though she makes it herself in jail), and in the end, she dies a horrfic death for her cause.Maria also does a fascinating job playing Joan, and her pain and sorrow are portayed beautifully. Her thick tears, her large, pierce eyes, and simply put, her soul make for a powerful performance.I've already touched slightly on the look of Passion, and apart from how Joan of Arc is portrayed, it also holds up for a movie from 1928. No film dirt or signs of age (apart from an ancient credit style and glorious black and white footage) are shown, and even 94 years later, the film holds up, even visually.The visuals, emotions and cinematic power of The Passion of Joan of Arc is what makes it one of the most beautiful films I have ever seen, even if it is nearly a century old.

The combination of innovative, intimate and intense photography coupled with the beautifully expressive facial expressions from Miss Falconetti; the subtle but potent brutality of her persecutors - personified well by Eugene Silvain's Bishop Cauchon but also well exemplified by the cold and soul-less panel of judges all make this an effective and chilling film. The score - semi angelic, frequently intimidating but always powerful helps create an atmosphere that genuinely makes you feel fear and trepidation for this young woman, a pawn in things she little understands, but sticking faithfully to her beliefs of divine intervention and pureness of spirit.

Dreyer, casting out a large net to find the perfect Joan, spotted Falconetti acting in a comedy on a local Paris stage. A screen test on film verified his hunch. The director remembered he \"found in her face exactly what I wanted for Joan: a country girl, very sincere, but also a woman of suffering.\"Dreyer had researched for some 18 months on the leader of the French troops who fought against an occupying English army. The funding studio, France's Society Generale des Films, provided the director a script, which upon first reading, Dreyer tore. He decided to incorporate the actual testimony of her fateful trial as the basis for his film. He condensed the lengthy trial into an abbreviated one day on the screen. Earlier, the French studio agreed to the director's initial wishes by building a very expensive replica of 1400s Rouen, France, complete with wall towers, a chapel, a church's court and concrete walls thick enough to support a number of actors. Big mistake. Dreyer was so enamored by Falconetti's striking facial expressions he decided to forgo all the elaborate historical surroundings. He felt such a cityscape would detract from the intimacy of his characters and made the bold decision to film mainly closeups on the trial's participants faces, mostly shot with his camera low looking upwards.To say the Society Generale des Films was upset at the large construction expenditures being wasted was an understatement. The studio had hired Dreyer on the basis of his previous film, the Danish movie, 1925's 'Master of the House,' and had acquiesced on his demands while he doing his research on Joan of Arc that it build an entire medieval village. The final result of \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" was a unique look never seen on the screen before, and rarely, with this amount of intensity on actors' faces, was ever seen again.There's conflicting reports of how Dryer got Falconetti to show the reaction of each of the trial interrogators' questions and decisions. One account has the director forcing the actress to kneel with no kneepads on a stone so her inner pain would be expressed on her face. Others say he repeatedly cleared the set, with just the cameraman, who focused on her face for crucial reaction scenes. Dreyer said a director \"must be careful never to force his own interpretation on an actor, because an actor cannot create truth and pure emotions on command. One cannot push feelings out. They have to arise from themselves.\" An observer noted, \"Dreyer and Falconetti would watch the rushes of a single scene together, seven or eight times, until Dreyer could pick out a little bit, maybe a few feet, where the effect was what they wanted, and when they reshot the scene, she could play it without the least inhibition. Just those few feet of film had inspired her.\"The director was searching for realism in his actors, ordering that none wear face makeup: the more worts and wrinkles on a character's skin, the better. He also filmed the inquisitors in bright light, with harsher black and white contrasts, while Falconetti was given the softer gray treatment. This is to show the judges possess a diseased inner life while Joan displays a saintly aura surrounding her.Because of the sensitivities of the largely Catholic French nation, \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" was greeted with a round of censor cuts, much to the director's chagrin. Dreyer did make a second version of the film, restoring some of the government's cuts. When it was released, critics labeled it as one of cinema's greatest masterpieces. But the film was banned in Britain, with its authorities claiming the portrayal of the English soldiers paralleled those of the Romans during Jesus' time. \"The Passion of Joan of Arc,\" turned out to be a flop in the theaters, and the Society Generale Studio canceled its contract with Dreyer for future films. He ended up suing the studio, claiming it mutilated his original movie to please the censors. He couldn't direct another movie until the suit was settled in late 1931.As history has proven, \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" is praised as one of the all-time greats in cinema. The Village Voice named it the eighth best film in the 20th century. A number of noted filmmakers, including Michael Mann and Walter Salles, claimed to have been influenced by the movie. Film critic Pauline Kael called Falconetti's portrayal of Joan as \"maybe the finest performance ever recorded on film.\"As for Falconetti, who had appeared in only one minor movie in 1917, she returned to the stage as an actress and a producer, feeling there was no future for her in film. She fled France during World War Two, and ended up in Buenos Aires, Argentina. Gaining weight, she went on a self-imposed restrictive diet.

By all accounts he really put her through it but drew from her one of the most unforgettable performances on film. Pauline Kael has called it the greatest performance but that is purely subjective.

I wasn't expecting this to be so intense. The directing and cinematography are peak and the performances, mainly Ren\u00e9e Falconetti, scorch the retina of both agony and crucifixion. The additional impeccable score acts as a guiding force that tethers the film together. It's all too perfect right here. Love the religious symbolism and god do I love the composition. Joan is framed with the camera looking down, but as she remains steadfast, the camera hoisters down a bit and views her upward, emphasizing her moral superiority and power over the court.What fascinates me the most is the how the film challenges both a Catholic and Atheist viewpoint. A catholic may view the corruption of the court as elites who have abused their free will granted by God. Whereas an atheist may believe that the court's antithetical use of God suggests there is no true God. Carl Theodor Dreyer also uses imagery to enhance the conflict. The obvious cross symbol is ever so present but Dreyer twists its inherent nature, embodying cruelty rather than redemption. Consider the shadow of the religious cross reflected through a window. As Joan makes a slight smile at the shadow, it instantly vanishes, blocked by the two-faces judge's white garment. Religion has the divine opportunity to heal and console, but when challenged with a perplexed evil, it can do nothing but scurry in fear.Man, it's the movies like these that inspire me to create and pursue all the passions. They're also clear examples of the often neglected silent age of film. Most people won't watch this simply because it was made in a time without spoken language.

From development to release to censorship, to seeming loss and eventual restoration, there is much to discuss about 'The passion of Joan of Arc' even before considering the content. And with that firmly in mind - this is an outstanding picture. Set design and decoration, and costume design, are deceptively complex and precise. Very particular use of lighting is still more readily impressive, not least of all as it is used to emphasize Joan's perspective or her antagonists' malignance.And then there's the direction: Carl Theodor Dreyer demonstrates keen sensibilities deserving of the movie's renown. There are sparing but pointed uses of tracking, panning, framed shots, or other specific techniques. Much more than anything else, however, Dreyer employs close-ups in his camerawork and shot composition, with many shots tightly focused on a single individual so as to accentuate the subtleties in their countenance, or the details in a set piece, prop, or other especial facet of the production.Indeed, there's much to take in, not least of all with such a fantastic cast to build the picture. In each of Joan's jailers and inquisitors we see the vigor the actors bring to their roles, realizing anger, spite, and mocking confidence that belies terrible cruelty and immense hypocrisy. It's a joy to watch them at play - yet much more than this, it's hard not to be impressed with star Ren\u00e9e Jeanne Falconetti. She embodies Joan with incredible nuanced range besting that of her co-stars, to the point that to an extent it's not wrong to think of 'The passion of Joan of Arc' as a psychological drama, so closely is it centered on her state of mind. Falconetti captures with wonderful capability every ounce of Joan's deep sadness, zealous resolve, and recognition of her mortality, and it is without a doubt an extraordinary display of acting skills, matching or exceeding the best to be found anywhere in the silent era or beyond.Consider, too, themes including the overreach and abuse of power of the Church, misogyny, gender roles, and the way institutional Christianity regards women. Though simple on the surface, there's much to glean from the film, and much that it tries to do. Perhaps a little too much, as the finale runs a little long in the tooth, in my opinion, following Joan's inevitable departure. It's also worth noting that while directly inspired by the historical record of Joan of Arc's trial, the picture is more of a truncated interpretation of the course of events. Still, these are rather minor matters, and don't truly have bearing on the great quality of the feature. For its place in cinema history, let alone on its own merits, this is a superb classic that holds up exceptionally well almost 100 years later.

The film itself, has a few problems and probably deserves a \"C\". It does have some great composition shots, great framing and excellent positioning of the characters. Some of it could have been highly influenced by the \"Cabinet of Dr. Caligari\" (1920). The best shot is the one of Joan in front of the cross during her second sentencing. In the finale, in the scene with the stake, the imagery is terrifying and believable too. There are some offshoot mistakes, where you can see the top or side or creases in the set walls, but nothing awful. The film itself probably would have been better if it was shortened just a little.There is also a very interesting feeling of early lesbian persecution by the religious judges that I feel captured the mythos of Joan of Arc. The short hair, the guards having fun with her and tormenting her with the crown and arrow. Making her look like she is a freak, the religious persecution and calling her a monster, all gave a hint of early, unfair, paranoid, prejudices that we still see even today and from what I understood about Joan of Arc, may have been very accurate.And, talk about images of emotional angst. Every supporting character, with a long close-up shot, looks amazingly framed. You feel the emotions just rolling out of each person, that Carl Dreyer's camera touches. Which brings me to Falconetti. I really feel bad talking about her performance, considering the woman went nuts afterwards, because she immersed herself into the roll too deep. It drove her mad and she became a recluse and apparently died young. It is sad and I fear her performance may have been too deep and from what I have read annoyingly so.Which also brings me to the \"film-experience\" thing I mentioned before. If you watch this film and add in the life of Joan of Arc, the film itself, the post film life of Falconetti and the remarkable journey that the film itself took after the initial 1928 release, than the film is an \"A\". The amazing parallel directions that all four of these aspects actually take is frightening. The similarities between the mythos of Joan of Arc and the life of Falconetti was creepy. The film itself, thought lost forever, enjoyed a reincarnation, of sorts, or a second chance. In fact if someone wanted to make a movie or TV mini-series about the whole ball of wax I think it would be pretty cool.

After I came to have more faith in Christ and a closeness to Catholicism, I came to understand that it was through Joan of Arc, I believe that this saint intercedes for me to this day, so that I may reach higher levels of faith and at the end of my life rest in Christ.So, since she is such an important figure to me I decided to watch her films, which I admit I hesitated for a good time, since in recent decades we had dozens of religious films that did not mind being really good movies, or worse, treated the faith of a Christian as something that came out of nowhere, without reason or reason , and anyone who truly believes in God knows that these representations of the Christian faith are very poor.Anyway I decided to start with the most praised, studied and debated by moviegoers throughout history.I watched a completely mute version, just the film and its lines of dialogue, and I must say that it was a powerful experience, I am to this moment perplexed by every second I saw, the emotions that Joana felt defined mine, I felt close to the character, as if I were in the same situation as her.The threat that those judges face is almost demonic, even if someone who was a saint (which was Joan's case) would question whether he is really guilty of something or would think of surrendering to false accusations just to get rid of that threatening environment.And the performance of Maria Falconetti deserves all the applause of those who watch, this woman delivered everything of herself for this film, all the expressions that conveys the emotions of the character, be it a tear of suffering, a look at the sky representing her faith, a finger pointing that shows her resistance, or a small smile that exudes passion. If the character didn't even have a line in the entire movie, we'd still capture everything that's passed on screen.The film gains even more merits by choosing the documents and historical records that were preserved from that time, especially in the trial of Joana, making it believable even for those who do not believe in the religious part of history, director Carl Dreyer was very smart the religious vision to the look of Joana, which we can perceive with its symbolisms, for example the window with a cross shape.The most interesting after the end of this film was that, I do not feel like watching any of the others, not because I believe they are bad but because I believe it is difficult to overcome the impact that this had on me, eventually I will watch them of course, but I am fully sure that 'La passion de Jeanne d'Arc' is the definitive work on this saint of which I have so much affection.And if I may be religious again in my analysis, ora pro nobis Jeanne, di vivere Christus rex!", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "This movie is Powerful!", "date": "2021-04-16T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6818780", "sentiment score": [0.1207, 0.1249, 0.094, 0.2481, 0.4124]}, {"content": "As may be well known, this silent film is by far one of the greatest films of the silent era.It is Dreyer's greatest achievement and a must see for all serious film students and fans of cinema.The film has no flaws.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 0, "votes": 0}, "heading": "Dreyer's Cinematic Masterpiece", "date": "2021-04-07T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6787902", "sentiment score": [0.0012, 0.0014, 0.0077, 0.0753, 0.9145]}, {"content": "The experience of watching the film itself was the equivalent of being stuck in a courtroom watching a trial you have no emotional investment in.", "rating": 4, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 6}, "heading": "The main actress gave a compelling performance but...", "date": "2021-03-14T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw6692632", "sentiment score": [0.2304, 0.2549, 0.2325, 0.1677, 0.1145]}, {"content": "Such raw performances! personally I think it's perfect as a silent movie.

I had goosebumps throughout the whole duration of the movie and just the idea of seeing this in the 1920s with the live orchestra makes me envy those who had their chance in the past. Just the music was enough to get me invested in the film but combining that with a great and passionate plot just made the watching experience unforgettable.Joan of Arc is a hero to many, an inspiration for many more, and a known historical figure for most. Looking back at when I was still at school, we only knew her as a heroine and savior of France, who was burned at the stake for her heresy, but we never discussed why and how that happened, we were only focused on the results of the Hundred Years' War. Looking back at it right now, that might not have been the best approach, since the story of Joan of Arc is an inspirational tale with a sad and bitter ending that offers a lot of insight about the less talked about side of the war. For example, an analogous version of Joan of Arc in Lithuania is Emilija Pliateryte - she was a patriotic noblewoman, who fought in the November Uprising of 1830-1831 against the Russian empire. She wasn't killed in battle, she has succumbed to an illness, but her feats and accomplishments are still talked about to this very day, just like with Joan of Arc.Since I started to talk about one woman, that's important to Lithuanian history, I'd like to talk about another one, a less know one - Monika Aluzaite. A Lithuanian historian Marius Emuzis recently put her story into a book and to me, it's really inspiring. Monika joined the partisans as a high school senior and even though she was with the partisans who were engaging in guerrilla warfare against the Soviet army after WW2, her battle was different - she was creating and distributing Lithuanian literature. After getting caught in a bunker by the enemy forces, she tried to kill herself to prevent any information from falling into the wrong hands. Her attempt wasn't successful and she ended up being tortured and blackmailed by the KGB. There's one picture in the book that really stuck out - a photo from her criminal proceeding, where she's standing with her hair cut off, eyes barely open and barely conscious after the second attempt of trying to commit suicide. The connection with Joan of Arc that I'm seeing is the passion and the will to do anything you can for the country you love, whether in the name of God or in the name of your people.Going back to the movie, what surprised me is that I didn't find any of the visuals to be boring. Seeing the emotions in everyone's faces during the silent film era just feels... different. The movie was directed by Carl Theodor Dreyer, the same guy, who's responsible for Vampyr (1932) to the big screen and I'm starting to feel like his work might be really experimental for the time, at very least it's really clever as the filming techniques used in both The Passion of Joan of Arc and Vampyr are impressive, some of the choices made might be difficult to pull off even for the modern-day cinema. I might be wrong with the last statement, but I just don't feel as impressed in that matter with a lot of modern-day hits, but on the other hand - they have more tools to visually and audibly entertain the viewer.Overall, I was really impressed with the movie, even if writing about it made me write about some unrelated matters that sort-of relate to the figure, whose demise was displayed in the movie - Joan of Arc.

However, the clergy are determined to break her at any cost.Leading the charge is Maria Falconetti as Joan, who captures just how out of her depth and terrified Joan is in this situation, often with a distraught look on her face, while still giving the role a sense of dignity and commitment, much like Joan's to her faith. The supporting cast is made up of the various clergy and guards, most of whom are of older age, and enhanced by the black and white, giving their pock-marked faces an almost demonic feel. They almost become living gargoyles, and only enhance further just how isolated and helpless our lead is.On a technical level, Dreyer goes for an unorthodox approach for the time.If you've seen any silent films, or just glanced at pictures, they often have the camera pulled far back, more akin to recording a stage show. However, Dreyer goes up close and personal, often utilizing close-ups to give a claustrophobic feel, and combined with some sharp lighting and the lack of make-up on the actors, create an uncomfortable and tense atmosphere. Musically, the film has never had an officially confirmed soundtrack, so there exist many versions. The one I'm basing this review on is the Criterion version, which uses Richard Einhorn oratorio 'Voices of Light', a haunting choral piece that compliments the religious themes and imagery perfectly and adds a surreal dimension to Dreyer's uncomfortable visuals, turning the film into a sensory experience that envelops you utterly.Naturally, with no spoken dialogue, most of the narrative has to be conveyed by the actors and a couple of title cards here and there. However, don't be fooled by what may sound this archaic: it's actually very effective. The reason being is quite simple: it's a very emotional story, both in terms of reaction as well as presentation. There is an almost beautiful directness that perfectly lets in on how our characters, mainly Joan, feel and think as the trial goes on. Simple nods of the head or movement of eyes tell us what, often times, dialogue can't or if it tries, it's not very effective. Furthermore, it allows us to inhabit Joan's skin and feel what she feels. This is especially poignant when the camera is not on her, and because of the near constant close-ups, you almost begin to feel like you're the one on trial, surrounded by all this angry men. It really cranks up the tension and unease as you watch, which is, frankly, really impressive for a film this old.What's more, despite the presence of religion, it's not that mystical or fantastical. Rather, the film is more about belief, and how it can be wielded: Joan's belief in her divinity, the clergy's belief in her heresy, the belief Joan instills in others, who may or may not betray her as the story goes on. Regardless if God is real or not, it's the fact that Joan's faith is so incredibly strong that she ultimately is willing to die for it that is the core of the story. This is enhanced by the fact that she isn't some kind of super-woman: Joan does get frightened, and even at one point, comes close to completely breaking down when the pressure gets to her, allowing us to see the human being behind the legend.However, there are gripes. As I mentioned before, this particular version's musical score can be a little overpowering at times, but even watching a different version, there are still some little 'hiccups'. The clergy, though effectively intimidating, are not much more than one-dimensional villains, and little is made of the richness that is the debate of which side truly knows more about Christianity and faith, though you can write it off as simply being constricted by the time the film was made in.

The cast is fronted by Maria Falconetti, but also stars Eugene Silvain, and Andr\u00e9 Berley. This film has a very interesting history, including being thought to have been lost for 50 years or so. This was also Falconetti's first, and final film of her life. She lived for 18 years afterward, but she just never starred in any films again. It just goes to show that some of the best art or film is unsuspecting. I'm glad to say that this film is tragically beautiful.\nLet me first address what makes this movie; Maria Falconetti. This is one of the best, if not the best performance I have ever seen. I might almost say the best because she perfectly uses her face to express all of her emotions. You know what she is thinking, what she fears, what she hopes. She stares at the ceiling as if she is pleading with god, trying not to question her faith. I could only ever imagine this film as a silent one since the performance by Falconetti is just so passionate and breathtaking. The other performances are also good of course too, especially the young priest who has a very memorable scene with Joan. In other words, the performance from Falconetti and company is worth it in itself.\nSecondly, the cinematography and photography went absolutely hand in hand with the performances. There were many shots where I got goosebumps, or where you could pause and write an essay about that still image. Almost every shot of Joan is a close up, and it works excellently. It just shows you don't need a big budget to get shots with such beauty and emotion.\nThe performances and cinematography are amazing, but all the other aspects are at least I would say \"good\". The story is pretty simple, but that is all we need for this experience. The pacing is just right, transitioning right when scenes would lose their light. The set's are I would say good for the time, but nothing spectacular, but it doesn't need that. Most of the music is harrowing but in a sense mystical at times. The only little problem I have is that sometimes solo male voices in the music kinda broke immersion for a second. This was only because they were so prominent that it took my attention off of the scene, instead of blending with it.\nIf you're reading this by now you're either really love it like me, or are very very interested. So all there is I need to say is that this movie is in the film hall of fame for me. It just left me thinking all night, and was a truly beautiful film.

For this reason, most of my favorite silent films are comedies, because physical humor translates without anything spoken. I was quite worried when I started The Passion of Joan of Arc because it felt like so much of the movie was intertitles. With silent films I feel there is a tipping point where too many title cards start to pop up and my brain begins to think \"Maybe I should just read a book on this subject, because they don't seem to be utilizing the visual medium of film as much as they are just showing expository text.\" Thankfully, this didn't last long. It seems the early scenes are designed to set up the narrative, so that the visuals can do the story-telling the rest of the way through. In fact, at one point I was wishing for a title card (to spell out the words in the note she is asked to sign) and they didn't give me one.I was certainly impacted by the story of The Passion of Joan of Arc, because it is a great historical tale of injustice and martyrdom. You can't avoid feeling sympathy for her character, particularly since about half the film is just close-ups of Maria Falconetti staring into the middle distance in different states of sorrow, shock, and horror. This makes it almost impossible to escape the emotion of the events unfolding, because we are forced to watch the toll it is taking on this poor woman. The constant conniving of the religious leaders overseeing her trial is devastating, and I suspect a bit mild compared to the way this thing actually unfolded in 1431. In many ways it reminded me of films I've seen about the trials of Jesus prior to his crucifixion, and it elicited a similar emotional reaction from me. That being said, while I was impacted by The Passion of Joan of Arc, and I recognize some of the wonderful film-making, it wasn't exactly my cup of tea. It is so depressing, and the endless shots of her teary eyes were hard to take.

However, i have seen some other classic films from the decade so i better go with comparing this one to those. Hereby, i say The Passion Of Joan Of Arc is a Classic storytelling of a devastating tale of a Legendary Heroine Figure in France History. In 1431, Jeanne d'Arc is placed on trial on charges of heresy. The ecclesiastical jurists attempt to force Jeanne to recant her claims of holy visions but she declines and seeks a salvation through ultimatum of Death. The story itself is very passionate and dedicated yet it has too much of spiritual thoughts. It shows that, yes the death could be an alternate freedom and may be that's how you repent your sins. I liked these thoughts already but i liked it more when it all came in artistic form like facial Expressions, atmosphere, tension and background music. I believe, that was a golden era for Cinema World when silence and expressions used to speak clearer and louder than Voiced Dialogues because then makers had to think about how to express the scene on screen how to bring conviction, how to build the interest rather than making it verbal which happened later in Talkies era. And i must say Director Carl Theodor Dreye brought that conviction without exaggerating anything. Simplicity is the Key here. In the lead role Falconetti delivered one of the most memorable performance for any actress in silence era. Her eyes, her expressions, her pain everything was amazing and wonderful.

Ren\u00e9e Falconetti's performance brings that raw personage to life with an emblazoned look upon her face of the fervent young lady who has devoted her life to only God and expelling the English from France. Her gaze tells us that only she knows the truths that lie beyond the sight of mortal man and the complexity of her delivery makes it seem as if she also wonders why she should ever be put on trial for that which is an indisputable verity to her. Her gaze alone will grip you and hold you until the film is finished.\nThe cinematography of Rudolph Mat\u00e9 is astoundingly beautiful. The way the camera surveys the male judges, creeps along the courtroom and stalks the townspeople truly brings the film to life.

We feel for her. We yearn to help her. But she does not want absolution from an unenlightened gang of men who know nothing of her struggles. She only wants the love of God.

Everything that could distract from the faces has been eliminated. No make up, a set consisting of only white walls (which in reality were painted pink so that the color in black and white would be right) , no music and last but not least a story that exclusively focuses on the trial of Jeanne d'Arc and not on the battles that preceded the trial.

The interrogators of Joan were filmed from a low angle and in high contrast lighting. This way they would appear more intimidating.

After reading it, we will find a true Jeanne, a simple and humane young woman who removes her armor and died for the country.\nThis seemingly religious film has a very different narrative at the beginning. The whole passage does not involve the concept of God at all. Instead, it focuses on one word, that is, \"human nature\". Say it is the \"belief\" in human nature.\nOver the past few hundred years, the image of Jeanne d'Or has long been mythical. She is a national hero of France and a goddess in the mouth of people. But it is ridiculous that such a Catholic saint with a strong religious meaning was due to political purposes. Burned to death for religious reasons. Such a fact makes people wonder: Is religion so ridiculous in some ways, and does God really exist? It can be said that at least in this film, the role of God is completely missing, and the close-up shots are very clear and belong to human faces. In the first half of the film, what we saw was just a face of a series of ridiculous interrogations, filled with desperate images of poor Jeanne, and the opposite, the laughter, ruthlessness and enthusiasm of most of the judges around indifferent. The atmosphere of extreme despair made people unable to catch a trace of God's existence. And halfway through the film, the three soldiers' ridicule and playfulness towards Jeanne reached its peak. The saint in the mouth of the people is being bullied like an ordinary prisoner of war, an ordinary woman at this moment. The crown she regarded as a sacred symbol was now reduced to a plaything above the sword in the hands of soldiers. When the only outside light on the floor was blocked by the shameless judges, all the divinities disappeared at this moment. In addition, in addition to a few distant shots of the perspective shots in the film, most of the angles of view come from the up shots. In other words, they belong to the angle of view that cannot belong to God.\nHowever, when God seems to be gone, facing the persecution of power, is there no way as an individual, not so. \"True salvation is not a victory after fighting, but a strength and peace of mind that can be found in suffering.\" So we saw in the second half of the film that the flinching, weak Jean was gone, replaced by a pair of stern eyes, an unyielding response, and a soul full of faith.\n\"I totally love and respect God with all my heart\"\n\"He claimed that I was sent by the devil\"\n\"That is not true\"\n\"In order to make me suffer, the devil sent you\"\n\"with you\"\n\"And you\"\nThis refusal, with all her power, sent out to the judges. It's just that this power does not come from the dead God, but from her own, from a person's inner, unbreakable faith. At this time, it is no longer important to whom the object of the belief is, and more importantly, this belief and the power it carries are burst out of a person and the heart of the person after the object has long been destroyed.\nAlthough Joan of Arc had been shaken in the face of the upcoming fire punishment, it was the saint and the faith that never burned down in the fire. The director then expressed the scene that the French people were called by Jeanne d'Arc and immediately began to fight the soldiers, simply visualizing this power.\nSince the two industrial revolutions, mankind has shouted the slogan of God 's death against the background of rapid technological advancement, but with it comes the heavy fall of souls from generation to generation, and the human spirit seems to remain after God 's departure A huge gap was added, and then a series of things that filled this gap added greed and sin that were left after the rapid development of many material civilizations. Maybe God is indeed dead, or not, but what mankind really lacks at this moment is not just an unknowable unknown force, but more importantly the faith, or rather, the faith itself.\nFinally, the status of this film in film history is also commendable. Although the use of a large number of close-up shots is a reflection of the director's personal style, but the win is to win in the movie itself and the theme is very suitable. This film with almost no plot focuses more on the characterization of the characters, and the close-up shot becomes the optimal solution to achieve this goal under this condition. In addition, there is a very important point, the film was filmed in 1928, at this time, the sound film has just been born a year has not yet been popular. Instead of relying on the dialogue presented by the sound, the audience's attention is completely placed on the picture itself. The superb performance of the characters + the use of close-up shots + the clear-cut editing (the front and back contrast or the corresponding combination of pictures are used in the film many times The rendering of emotions) + the background music of the piano music constitutes the expression effect of the history of this vertical shadow. I have to say that this is really an art that belongs only to the silent era. The film fully embodies the unique charm of the film as a \"dumb art\" and truly achieves the so-called \"silent wins with sound\" effect.\n\"When the flame rises to the sky, it engulfs Jeanne's soul, Jeanne's heart has become the heart of France, Jeanne will be remembered and cherished by the French people forever.\"", "rating": 8, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "Faith for survival", "date": "2020-04-16T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5644891", "sentiment score": [0.2178, 0.3603, 0.2061, 0.1641, 0.0518]}, {"content": "This movie is such an intense experience, and if you are in the mood it can have a lasting impact.There are two sides to this.

Humongous set build just for the film, visionary camera techniques yet unseen, controversial subject matter, powerful role performances.

True, the story itself is a bit bare boned compared to modern films, but the fact that it's based on true events, real historical trial manuscripts, gives it gravitas.And it's simply shot so well. Director Carl Theodor Dreyer relies on extreme close-ups and harsh lighting to accentuate either the suffering or the grotesqueness of his characters, and it works wonders. Denying his actors makeup also helps, highlighting every pore and wrinkle on their faces.Ren\u00e9e Jeanne Falconetti's performance as Joan of Arc has been hailed as one the all-time best in cinema history. Not without merit, I have to admit. The fragility of Joan and her situation in the hands of English comes through crystal clear. Yet, her performance is perhaps too fragile. If you study Joan of Arc at all, and especially if you read the actual trial manuscripts, you're going to meet a woman perfectly willing to give as good as she gets. A woman of conviction, who laid doubt into the hearts of even her harshest critics with her piety and belief.

When The Passion of Joan of Arc was released, narrative film was really only about 20 years old. It's seems like a paltry selection of films from which to pull the best ever. I suppose the closest corollary in my lifetime would be video games. Mass consumer video games seem to have a birth in the late 70s and early 80s. When a game came out in the late 90s and early 00s that was considered one of the best ever, at the time, how long will that opinion last? Will people who play games in 2080 still consider that game to be one of the greatest ever?\nSuch questions come to me when thinking about the reception The Passion of Joan of Arc received upon its release. I've read contemporaneous reviews that called it the greatest film ever made. Seems like a small feat when compared to a movie called greatest ever now, with 90 more years of films to deal with.\nAnd yet, I don't think anything has changed about this film's place at the height of cinema.\nFilm as an Emotional Medium\nTo really begin, here's a link to the entire movie with the Voices of Light soundtrack. Do yourself a favor, especially if you've never seen this movie, and at least bookmark it to watch at some point.joan2Film is really primarily an emotional experience. Storytelling in general asks people to connect with fictional characters, to understand who they are and why they do what they do. That's particularly strong in film because we actually see people's faces as they go through events.\nThe use of faces in The Passion of Joan of Arc is particularly important. Whenever people talk about this movie, the one thing that comes up most is the central performance by Renee Folconetti. She was a stage actress who had never worked in film before. She would also never work in film again. Part of that is probably because of what we actually see in the movie. She's obviously emotionally distressed, and there are stories that the direct, Carl Theodore Dreyer, pretty much tortured her to get the performance, and it was wildly effective.\nJoan's eyes are wide with innocence as she navigates her interrogators' questions, making them seem alternatively foolish and unserious. It's both Joan's strength and fragility, all told through Falconetti's performance, that sells the conflict. We are with her from the beginning to the end, and it's quite an emotional journey.\nExperimentaljoan3I revisited the movie for this post and I had completely forgotten how much the camera moves. I don't know about you, but when I think of silent filmmaking, I imagine hand-cranked cameras on tripods. The cameras used in The Passion of Joan of Arc were hand-cranked, but it feels like they were never on tripods.\nThe camera swings around, back and forth, and is always pushed right into actors' faces. The production company actually spent a significant amount of money building an entire French medieval town for the film, and they were angry at Dreyer because the audience barely sees it. The movie has wider shots here and there, but the story is almost entirely told in close-up, and often at off angles.\nFor those who think that filmmakers never really got inventive until that one movie that speaks to them personally but was released in the late 90s and they watched at a formative time, it's interesting to see them take in the fast editing and fun camera work in a movie from the 20s.\nPreservationjoan4I provided a link earlier to a free streaming version of the film. If you do just go over and watch the first few minutes, there's a bit (the copy is from the Criterion collection version) that includes a brief history of the film, including the fact that the original version was considered lost for decades.\nI can't find any images of the comparison, but one difference between the cut Dreyer cobbled together after the original negative went up in flames and the one we have today is in a scene late in the movie where Joan gets blood-let. First of all, it's an actual arm, an actual knife, and actual blood. And they did it twice, to the same person (apparently not Falconetti), within minutes.\nThe first version is what's in the restored, original cut. The spray is strong and jumps out of her arm. In the cobbled together cut, the spray is much less powerful. (I know I've seen that alternate take, and I think it's on the Criterion DVD as an extra, but I'm not reorganizing my attic to find it. I have the ripped version of the movie on my hard drive, and that's going to be good enough for now.)\nI don't place film preservation on the same level of importance as someone like Martin Scorsese (whose movie Hugo is a celebration of film preservation), but The Passion of Joan of Arc and the fact that it was completely lost for decades, and could have been lost forever, tells me of the effort's importance. I never want to see that cobbled cut with alternate takes for everything. It's not what Dreyer had decided was the best representation of the film he had made. It was a lesser version. I'd never want that.\nGreatest Ever\nI only order my Top Ten based on either time or alphabetically. I'm not interested in pitting movie 5 and 6 against each other. I just want to celebrate them both.\nThe one exception to that rule would probably be this. I think that if I were to ever actually order the list from best to least best, The Passion of Joan of Arc would be number 1.\nIt was the greatest movie ever made in 1928, and I think it very well may be the greatest movie ever made through 2019 still.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 1}, "heading": "Possibly the Greatest Film Ever Made, Still", "date": "2019-11-20T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5270002", "sentiment score": [0.0965, 0.2461, 0.2201, 0.2789, 0.1585]}, {"content": "Directed by Danish cinema master Carl Theodor Dreyer", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "An amazing film with a memorable powerful lead acting performance!", "date": "2019-10-27T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5216402", "sentiment score": [0.0939, 0.0847, 0.2295, 0.3401, 0.2517]}, {"content": "St. Joan of Arc is one of the most badass Saints in the Catholic Church.

The story itself so simple yet languorously explored in a series of long tracking shots, close ups, and dutch angled or lopsidedly framed scenes which seem to unfold a presence inside and hovering over Joan and the Church/Civil court proceedings. That presence or inescapable fullness is a marvel of filmmaking. How does one show the presence of what is unseen in a visual medium? Ironically the answer for Dreyer is often, to film nothing in particular and detach the camera from what the eye most wants to see.For those not familiar with the story portrayed in the film, Joan is accused by the English of heresy and blasphemy, claiming that God has sent her an angel, commanding her to lead an army of the French to defeat the English. Of course to the English this seems impossible because that implies that God loves the French more than the English and so the question her, attempt to trick her, and even torture her before she is eventually executed by fire.For a movie without sound, it is remarkably easy, through the performances, to interpret the roles of each of the court officials and priests as well as what degree to which they sympathize or abhor Joan. It is a testament to the development of cinephilic language to which Dreyer contributed that with the aid of only a sparse use of title cards, the audience is not only never lost but somehow transported into the bare court which Joan of Arc was forced to endure. I never felt like I was just watching something happen. I felt more like I was in the crowd, sitting next to a wicked priest condemning her, in her stead as she approached the instruments of torture, or even a member of the crowd, come to watch her death. That is quite a feat in a film where there is no sound to aid in that immersion.That isn't to say that it isn't work on the viewer's part. Intentionally, I think, Dreyer has directed a film in which you must be an active participant. It is easy to wander off in your mind or find yourself glancing down at your text messages. Just as Joan must actively submit herself to her death, we the viewer must make an effort to join her.For this reason, I find this film to be an excellent companion during this particular time of the year: Lent. During a season in which we deny ourselves forms of comfort and go beyond mere attempts to 'not commit sins' and find knew levels of resolve, weakness, and faith, I am reminded of how easily I stumble, even as Joan does, and hope that I may too, endure whatever trials I will face.It is a constant reminder that the faith which men may see as silly or weak is in fact, as Marcus Vinicius of \"Quo Vadis\" claims, a faith of courage.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 1, "votes": 2}, "heading": "The Greatest Silent Film Ever Made", "date": "2019-09-11T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw5114143", "sentiment score": [0.0118, 0.0169, 0.0366, 0.3456, 0.5891]}, {"content": "One could say that this film functions as a sort of 'rite of passage' for art film aficionados. As they say, 'If you can make it through this, you can make it through anything.' However, \"Jeanne d'Arc\" does not function as an overall great film in its own right, at least in my opinion.Honestly speaking, I would have found it nearly impossible to tell whether or not this was a so-called 'great film' had I not seen it on '100-best' movie lists. Certainly, I admire the creative camera angles and other directorial achievements of the film -- in this sense, it is somewhat interesting. However, no one, not even the most pretentious film snob should claim this film is interesting in terms of 'entertainment value.'Now, don't misunderstand me. Great works of art do not 'have' to be entertaining; but, all great works of art are 'fun' for one reason or another. I will explain.First of all, this, of course, depends on one's definition of 'fun.' The most basic, fundamental definition of fun -- mindless amusement -- is not that to which I am referring, though some great films do have this sort of appeal. (All works of art should make their audience think). Rather, the kind of fun I'm referring to is best described as a feast for the senses. One reason why I particularly love \"Citizen Kane\" and view it as my ideal 'great film' is because, if one engages every part of their being as they watch the film, the film will open itself up to them. It comes at its audience from many angles: it is an absolutely hilarious film, a dark film, a frighteningly ambiguous film, etc., depending on the perspective of the viewer.The problem that great films often pose to their audience is that they first REQUIRE that the audience think -- even be willing to suffer -- before they begin to give back in their feasting of the senses. Truly great films give back on one's investment of focus, engagement, and meditation on the film. I just don't believe that \"Jeanne d'Arc\" gives back enough. I can only take so much of Maria Falconetti's exalted expressions before my sense of logic tells me, \"Okay, now! That's enough! I get the idea!\" I feel like nearly half the film is spent staring into her pupils. To some, this might mark greatness; and yes, I admit that it makes the viewer think. But to me, it does not make the film watchable; and ultimately, I do not believe it pays off.These are my thoughts about the film. Sadly, I was expecting to enjoy it. I was ready for another feast of the senses, to have some fun, like with so many other great films; but sadly, this film could serve only as punishment to a sort of 'frenemie,' someone I am trying to wear out or impress via my film knowledge.

The 7th annual Oak Cliff Film Festival, held at the Texas Theatre (opened 1931), afforded just such a treat with its Friday evening screening.Most know the story of Joan of Arc (Jeanne d'Arc), a teenage heroine of France for her role in the Hundred Year War. She claimed that she received spiritual and religious guidance through voices and visions. Once she was captured by English allies, she was charged with heresy and burned at the stake in Rouen in 1431. A quarter century later, the Pope declared her a martyr and she became a symbol of France - canonized as a saint in 1920. Of course, here the story is as much about the film as it is the martyr and historical figure.The eyes are what first grab our attention. The eyes of actress Maria Falconetti as Joan of Arc. It was Falconetti's only screen appearance, and though she spent the rest of her career on stage, this role cemented her place in cinematic history. Without the benefit of sound and voice, the silent era performer had to emote through eyes, facial expression and body movement. Few ever did it better than Falconetti. It's gut-wrenching to watch the church counsel attempt to break her resolve. Our minds hear the intensity of their voices though we only read the subtitles. Renowned Danish filmmaker Carl Theodor Dreyer directs the script from writer Joseph Delteil (taken mostly from the transcripts of the trial), and the cinematography is through the eye of 5 time Oscar nominee Rudolph Mate' (FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, PRIDE OF THE YANKEES). It's impossible not to notice a style so different from modern day filmmaking. The harsh lighting and almost exclusive use of close-ups and medium shots bring an immediacy of which we aren't accustomed. The single piece set is quite unusual and provides a stage aura. Another thing that stands out is the editing style. Continuity of scene wasn't important here. What mattered was the sense of frantic pacing and over-bearing stress brought on by the rapid-fire questioning. We share the claustrophobic feeling with Joan, though of course, we know where this is all headed.As part of this special showing, the Oak Cliff Film Festival arranged for a live score performed by composer George Sarah, a 4 piece chamber orchestra, and a vocal group accompanying the music. Perhaps this meant even more to me since I visited Rouen last year, and the lasting legacy (almost 600 years) of this courageous young woman is evident throughout much of France. The re-mastered film is stunning to look at, and even more historically important knowing that the film had long thought to be lost to a fire.

Originally released as a completely silent film, I opted to watch it with the accompaniment of the 'Voices of Light' soundtrack, which renders the story in a much more spiritual manner.Accused of blasphemy, Jeanne d'Arc (Maria Falconetti) is placed on trial for refusing to recant her assertions that she's had visions of St. Michael, and that she was directed by the voice of God to take charge of her country's army and lead it to victory. In that regard, the picture's principal negative is that it's not placed in historical context, and one does not know the events taking place during the period of time the woman lived. It actually occurred during the latter half of The Hundred Years War (1337-1453) between England and France. Jeanne's involvement in the conflict turned a long standing Anglo-French conflict into something of a religious war, as her importance to the French cause grew over the course of time.One will be struck by the completely one sided nature of Jeanne's trial, one in which every theologian and judge mocked her replies and judged her responses as blasphemous. What's striking is the portrayal Maria Falconetti brings to her character, she is at the same time terrified of her ordeal, but sublime in the way she accepts her fate. It's one of the more impressive performances one would be fortunate enough to see, particularly coming from cinema's silent era.

From there we are transported directly to the trial, from the trial to the torture and from there to the bonfire.

Scenarios and environment are relegated to a secondary plan practically nonexistent. At the end of the film, the population at first anxious for the inquisition circus, only and just after Joan is burned, begins a riot of redemption against the guard, a historically fantastical event without any source that proves it.The film, in cinematic terms, is very crude, with nothing innovative at the technical level. However, it achieves its goal of managing to transmit the unfairness of the trial and conveying Joana's sense of connection to God, especially in the accompanying music version that nicely complements the expressions of actress Maria Falconetti throughout the process, making the viewing experience a little more sentimental. But the history of this martyr goes far beyond a trial that here represented does not capture the essence of her personality or the remarkable achievements that led her to this fateful point of her life. Assuming that the spectator is already familiar with the story of Joan of Arc, it lacks the character development in the historical context so that we can identify with it properly, which portrays a trial purely for rancorous and patriarchal reasons, and although this is true, there were also political interests that are never mentioned, revealing an obviously biased work that tries to acerbate dogmatic religious fervor even more.

The Passion of Joan of Arc is a French silent film based on the true story of the real woman by the same name who claims experiences of visions from God which angers the church. The film centers on the trial itself and ultimately her death at the stake. The story was wise to focus on only these events provided the documents available about the trial are public and regarded as definitive history. Furthermore, the filmmakers were wise to not explore her life or speculate on the truthfulness of her claims. Instead, the film is a powerful, relentless character study on a woman who stands by her convictions even if it costs her her life. This is executed spectacularly by our leading lady Maria Falconetti who delivers maybe the single best performance these eyes have personally witnessed in a silent film. Stellar performances aside, it's easy to understand why many considered this piece to be one of the first \"artistic\" films ever made.

The Passion of Joan of Arc is one of the most influential French films of its time, and still continues to inspire today. It focuses on the last days of Joan of Arc's life, and dives right into her trial immediately after being captured and accused of being a heretic.Being banned in multiple countries as it was controversial during their time, this film is a strong testament on how far human nature can go, how humanity can easily shift towards \"sides\" depending on number. Likewise, this film is a spiritual experience that explores the idea of faith, and how much sacrifice one can put in just trying to protect or restore one's beliefs. It doesn't show Joan of Arc prior to her days at the trial. It doesn't show her victories, her accomplishments, nor her success in leading the English out of France. Instead, it completely strips her to a character undergoing through a strong crisis as she goes through a questioning of fate that ultimately decides life or death.I have seen the version with music in it (and am currently interested in viewing the completely silent one), and it is truly transcendent. Considering the fact that it was done way back in 1928 impressed me, and the metaphysical journey that this may bring to the viewer\u2014religious or not, may take one to utmost beauty, even up to the brink of tears. Personally, the psychological power of the close-up made me sympathize much more with Joan, and the fact that Falconetti only acted once in her entire life is just stunning. Even without words, Falconetti is still able to display a performance of outright vulnerability while still being confident and at one with God.As per usual with silent films, I still did have some problems with this, and these are more personal ones that I found affecting my entertainment value of the film. As great as this film was, I found this one to be a difficult watch not just because of it's bleak subject matter, but also because of the way it was shot. I do understand the power of the close-up and I actually praised it a while earlier, but for me, using it for most of the film's shots was a mistake. There were barely any background pans or shots to establish the character's placement, so it's quite difficult to follow the location of each, making it sometimes a burden to watch. The wooden transitions between each scene also made everything jarring and dizzying. It's easy enough to forgive the film as it was almost made a hundred years ago, but I found myself occasionally distracted enough to pause the film, which isn't a good thing.In all, The Passion of Joan of Arc is easily commendable because of the technological advancement in film it made during that time, but the low rewatchability and abusive use of close-ups make this a difficult recommendation. Maria Falconetti's passionate performance may still make this film worthwhile, and the influence that this had on preceding films stretches out over many generations, but basing this on entertainment value, this film doesn't really hit the mark and, at times, feels outdated.", "rating": 6, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 5}, "heading": "Passionate and expressive.", "date": "2017-07-14T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3753676", "sentiment score": [0.0073, 0.0243, 0.0695, 0.5071, 0.3918]}, {"content": "Roger Ebert once said that \"to see Falconetti in Dreyer's \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" is to look into eyes that will never leave you.\" I cannot find a better statement for this miracle of a silent masterpiece. What has been mastered here is a view, taken from historical record, and put under a microscope figuratively and literally on screen to dive into the spiritual essence of destiny. This film is in a class by itself, and had a profound impact on this viewer.The film begins during the 100 Years War in France. In its battle against its enemy England, a commoner rose through the ranks to lead France to many great victories. This great warrior was peasant girl Joan of Arc, not even 18 years old but commanded a presence among her peers and a reputation impressed upon her enemies. Joan has been promised French deliverance from the mouth of God himself. Captured and put on what is essentially a mock trial for the whole film (she would have most likely been executed anyway) she must stand firm against the cacophony of priests who at first spit at her and call her a demon who cries blasphemy. Soon however, when she is given the chance to free herself at the expense of her devout belief in God and refuses, the film becomes a tragedy of the rest form, a good person making the ultimate sacrifice to something bigger than anyone in this film can possibly imagine. The mastery of this film's narrative is in its reliance on the extreme close-up, which i can only estimate takes up 95% of the film. Director Dryer and cinematographer Rudolf Mate take a radical approach to the film, which has stood the test of time as one of the most daring films ever made. Joan's face as well as the other characters fill the frame, and what was not normal for the silent films, the actors do not wear any make-up at all. What this gives is confinement in the audience, as wee are as locked in this small blank room as Joan is, thus helping us feel the emotions of the scenes and care for the main character in a unique way. We cannot look away from the faces, especially that of Joan's astonishingly beautiful eyes.What stands out in this film is the central performance of Maria Falconetti as Joan of Arc. When she enters the picture, she does not look like a common heroine. She has short hair, no make-up, and no soft lighting to make her \"gorgeous.\" In this way, Falconetti must communicate a visceral reaction and emotions through her facial expressions, and since she is always in close-up, this cannot escape and she cannot cheat. With this said, this is a truly flawless performance, in fact one of the greatest films I have ever seen in Cinema history. When she does stumble and ultimately does the \"morally right\" thing, I broke down in tears, quite rarely have I ever had so much respect and heartbreak over a person I never knew. This is a bravura performance that I cannot praise enough.The Passion of Joan of Arc is a miracle, and when given again the fact that it was made in the 1920s, this is even more astonishing. Please see this film and judge for yourself.Note: I am sorry I haven't written in a long time. College and work is murder and time must be put elsewhere quite a lot.

The primary challenge being the decision of whose version of history is to be told. Another of the monumental challenges facing the filmmaker is deciding what resources to use in the design and execution of the film. By the late 1920's, advancements in cinematic equipment and technique were becoming more refined to include many of the basic cinematic innovations that are commonly used today. Careful filtering of different styles over the course of several decades led to these refinements. However, when it comes to methods of creating personal style, there are always those who want to spend time reinventing the wheel or those who decide that they know better than those that came before them. This often leads to artistic revolutions that last a short time before dying out and the art reverts to the basics. This essay will analyze the flaws in The Passion of Joan of Arc in both cinematic composition and narrative construction. Before film, audiences were used to going to plays and seeing the action from one vantage point. As the art of cinematography was developing, filmmakers realized that the action had to stay on the same axis for continuity. This has become known as the 180-degree rule. This is a common rule of axis that allows the audience to orient the characters' relationship to one another regardless of the compositional framing. The Passion of Joan of Arc frequently breaks this rule, which has the effect of disorienting the viewer and giving no firm frame of reference to the geography of the Mise-en-sc\u00e8ne nor to the positions of characters. This issue is compounded by the overuse of close ups and washed out background that is bereft of any compositional detail. This was an odd choice considering the overwhelming abundance of magnificent architectural constructs available to those filming in Europe. This film is also hindered in the area of narrative construction. Although the historical figure of Joan of Arc might have been very familiar to European audiences due to her sainthood in 1920, it is no doubt true that some who may view this film might have no firm understanding of the events of the story. The lack of any expositional context is unforgivable even during this early period in cinema. The film opens with the book that supposedly contains the historical transcript of the trial from which the story is based. The text is written in two languages, one of which was swiftly fading from common use by the time of the production of the film. Another flaw in using this document as the basis for a story, which culminates in the burning death of a teenage girl, is the singular perspective of the transcript and the treatment of it as reliable. There exists no counterpoint to this trial therefore no advocacy of the defendant. These issues point out the basic artistic and technical flaws of filmmaking that had been weeded out by most in the industry by the time this film was made. The single redeeming characteristic of this film based on these criteria is the acting. Thompson and Bordwell say, \"Renee Falconetti gave an astonishingly sincere, intense performance as Joan\" (Kindle Loc. 5896) It can be said that the performances in The Passion of Joan of Arc are beyond any negative criticism. However, this sole exception cannot compensate for the overall poor execution of this production. Therefore, it can be argued that had the filmmaker used more fundamentally cinematic techniques, The Passion of Joan of Arc may not have fallen into obscurity only to be discovered in a sanitarium in Oslo back in the 80s.", "rating": 2, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 9, "votes": 23}, "heading": "A missed opportunity by a pompous filmmaker", "date": "2016-09-15T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3544776", "sentiment score": [0.0742, 0.4006, 0.3006, 0.1907, 0.0339]}, {"content": "I simply agree that this is one of cinemas true masterpieces, I'm with those who consider it one of if not the greatest film.Two details that I always loved; when Joan sits in her cell taking comfort by staring at the image of the cross formed by the windowpane, then the priest who pretends to befriend her but intends to betray her walks in and his shadow covers the image of the cross - wow, is there a more haunting or effective use of imagery in all of film?Also, I appreciated how at the end when she was about to be killed the same priest looked down on her, unseen, and bowed and shook his head with an expression of true sorrow.

Dreyer's vision with The Passion Of Joan Of Arc is still recognised as one of the greatest pieces of filmmaking in existence.Falconetti's performance as Jeanne d'Arc is widely accepted as one of the greatest performances ever committed to film and it should be very clear as to why. Her performance is very restrained, subtle and mature, providing distinctive character development, understanding and empathy through only her facial expression. The silent era was one where over-acting had become common but her performance did not follow such a convention and even by today's standards it's still a beautifully restrained performance. Her face and eyes are so expressive and emotional that they speak louder than any dialogue ever could, and with the film's cinematography focusing on extreme close-ups of the characters' faces, it emphasises the power that Falconetti could harness through such acting. The close-ups also allow us, as viewers, to pay attention to every facial twitch of Jeanne d'Arc throughout the film, adding to the emotional torture that she must have faced.The film is beautiful in every respect, from its cinematography's focus on extreme close-ups, its supporting character performances and even the few moments you truly glance at the set design and decorations. It all contributes wonderfully to Dreyer's vision of the trial of Joan of Arc, but the highlight for me, along with many other viewers, is certainly Falconetti's performance. It's honestly heartbreaking when the inevitably tragic ending is portrayed as for the brief time we, as viewers, have been watching the film, it certainly feels like we have got to know who both Jeanne d'Arc and Falconetti are and that she has opened herself up to the world - her performance is one of the most genuine performances I've ever had the pleasure of viewing.I definitely recommend this film, whether you're curious about acting, cinematography or silent cinema, this should definitely be essential viewing.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 6, "votes": 9}, "heading": "A Film of Transcendental Beauty.", "date": "2016-07-28T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw3513664", "sentiment score": [0.0022, 0.0028, 0.0065, 0.1476, 0.8409]}, {"content": "Maria Falconetti's performance was life altering.

The lack of parallel lines and order in the set design adds to the surreal and nightmarish sensation of being falsely accused. However, Falconetti brings us back to reality from the surreal world with her movements and expressions of despair, hope, anguish, love, faith and devotion. All of which define the human experience. Seeing her on screen was like seeing myself, Falconetti's eyes were a window into humanity. I could feel what she felt, I could see what she saw, and I could understand what she understood. This emotional investment in the film had me in tears the entire time. Never have I experienced a movie like this.

This is a film that, from its very inception, was a controversial subject that clerical authorities didn't want to be seen by a wide audience, for its portrayal of religion and politics. Nonetheless, writer/director Carl Theodor Dreyer pushed forward in a direction for a film on Joan of Arc that detailed the gap between religion and politics, in addition to insights into the complex of the fragile male ego that boasts assimilation and manipulation. After the completed and finalized print was lost in a fire, it was doubtful that a print even close to the original would ever resurface until one was discovered in a mental institution in Oslo, Norway in the 1980's. After some cleaning up and polish was added, the film was restored into an eighty-one minute cut, which is said to be very close to the original film's length and structure.Dreyer's focus in The Passion of Joan of Arc was precisely what the title suggests; an intimate and often harrowing portrayal of the agony the French heroine (played ever-so tenderly by Ren\u00e9e Jeanne Falconetti) endured following her unfair trial after the Hundred Years' War. Dreyer sees no point or purpose in showcasing sweeping battle sequences nor does he see it fit to detail Joan of Arc's story in a series of \"greatest hits\" moments that ultimately ends in a corrupt sentencing. Instead, Dreyer places us, the audience, in an awkward position throughout; we are practically voyeurs into the trial and sentencing of Joan of Arc, who we witness subjected to enough physical and mental torment to shatter one's entire self-worth. As she takes a stand for her faith and her beliefs of her own personal sainthood and relationship with God, she is bludgeoned and abused by an all-male jury and various authorities before being sentenced to death by being consumed by fire.The Passion of Joan of Arc can be viewed in two basic forms; in its original form, with no dialog, or a modified, Criterion Collection version that adds accompanying orchestration from Richard Einhorn called \"Voices of Light\" (which was my audio-track companion) throughout the film. Einhorn's score provides well-timed parallels in sound and musicality to events transpired on-screen, and the symphonic blend of instruments at various times adds to the cacophony of emotions and tones throughout the picture in a way that wouldn't be as impacting, I feel, with an empty audio-track. Dreyer's film has far too much potential for impact to be viewed in complete and utter silence.Dreyer's decision to focus largely on facial expressions and the facial personalities of characters almost overshadows the complex work of his and Rudolph Mat\u00e9's in the cinematography department. At the time of its release, The Passion of Joan of Arc erected one of the most expensive and immaculately detailed film sets in the history of cinema, with its construction of the famous Rouen Castle taking most of Dreyer's seven million franc budget on the film. Having said that, the detail in the background of the film is almost as important as the detail in the foreground, with hulking walls and set architecture towering over the characters in the film like a bitter and obvious presence. The walls are nothing more than helpless witnesses to the atrocious treatment of a very confident woman; so confident she makes her male counterparts squirm with inferiority and fear.Out of eighty-one minutes, probably a good forty or forty-five are Dreyer's camera lingering and depicting the facial and emotional reactions of Joan of Arc. Dreyer allows us to zero in on Joan of Arc's emotional responses as a way of peeling back the events of this film and revealing a tender, more human side that can often get lost in the shuffle. This is also likely why Dreyer forgoes the conventional battle sequences the Hundred Years' War practically loans itself to on film; it doesn't work to detail the kind of grounded human interest in the film.Finally, there's the concept of male ego that Dreyer subtly explores here. Consider how manipulated Joan of Arc becomes shortly after allowing herself to be tried for blasphemous remarks about her alleged sainthood and her relationship with God. Her trial was never intended to be fair, but instead, a circus for masculinity to triumph over a defenseless woman who was never going to be heard out on anything she had to say. As a result, the males of the court room decide to shame her, cutting off all her hair and physically and mentally abusing her in a barbaric manner that shows little else besides dominance over the meek and powerless in a cruel situation.The result is a heartbreaking film that grabs you with an all-too-real depiction of a time period frequently obscured by the lingo of textbooks and droll college lectures thanks to Dreyer's human approach and intimate focus on facial expressions and steadfast realism. It's only fitting that The Passion of Joan of Arc endured such a brutal life trying to gets its message out to a wide audience; it perfectly replicates the struggle and fight of its titular character.Starring: Ren\u00e9e Jeanne Falconetti.

Based on the real authentic records of the historic trial, this film depicts the last few days of Jeanne d'Arc, better known as Joan of Arc (Maria Ren\u00e9e Falconetti), on trial for the crime of heresy, because she believed it was her mission from God to support King Charles VII and fight or lead in the Hundred Years War, the battle between France and England. In court she is questioned by Bishop Pierre Cauchon (Eug\u00e8ne Silvain) and supported by some as a true saint, and she remains dedicated to her beliefs, and in her cell, while judges try to find evidence to convict her, she is interrogated by priests and attempts to convince her to change her views fail. These attempts include a false letter from the king, and she is denied a Mass, Jeanne does become visibly emotional during trial, with those speaking ill of her strong religious beliefs and the antagonism, she also faints at the sight of the torture chamber, but she does not give in to any demands of a change to her statements. However Jeanne is threatened with the penalty of being burned at the stake, and she finally breaks, allowing a priest to have her sign a document of confession, and she is given communion, but then again Jeanne recants and in the end as punishment is publicly executed in the courtyard at Rouen castle, burning at the stake while a crowd protests.

They urge us to draw our on conclusions on the happenings of the events.

Falconetti creates a stabbing ache in your stomach as you see the pain Joan has survived though and the state of fear she currently lives in.Her performance is most famous for her glaring eyes that stare into space in what feels like every scene.

Now every minute of her life, she sees those images of Him. It's a breathtaking performance that deserves to rank among the best in film history.

This sequencing suggests an inescapable iron encircling of Joan of Arc (whose close-ups were filmed with a fixed camera) by her vicious judges. All these shots created the same effect as that of the painting 'Christ Carrying the Cross' by Jheronimus Bosch, where the serene face of Christ contrasts sharply with the ferocity of the visages in the crowd around him. The camera angles and the decentered and canted framing further accentuate the contrast between Jeanne's face full of grace and the grim facial expressions of her corrupt judges, a bunch of perfidious theologians and dishonest lawyers.The film exposes blatantly the corruption of the Catholic Church, which slavishly defends the English crown and its interests.

But it's also a forthright picture sans make-up, sound, not even a backstory is there, but all of it is lacking for a reason. \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" is completely focused film-making, minimalism in its purest form, centering entirely on a core theme and thus radically eliminating all other elements that hinder the primary endeavor.

I did this with the silent comedies of Ozu, released by the BFI on DVD, mainly because I didn't like the new scores they recorded for them.

Nothing like it had been seen before. The performances are nearly perfect, although Maria Falconetti as Joan of Arc has few light moments, as you can imagine. Dreyer's direction was all new to the screen, mostly low-angle close ups. The set direction was similarly innovative. All the rooms are spare and brightly lighted. Even the torture chamber is clean and uncluttered -- no pots of oil bubbling over a fire, no hairy greaseballs going grimly about their tasks. We get a hypnotic glimpse of a spool of spikes whirling, and what appears to be some sharp and jagged farm implements hanging on the wall.I don't know where the Dreyer managed to find such faces. Some of the bishops have warts that look like boils; some have handsome and earnest features. The dwarf-like low-lifes who tug her from place to place caper and giggle with glee at Joan's distress. BOY, does the church want her to sign that paper that will at once save her life and betray her belief in God's message.But I can't watch it more than once or twice. There's very little in the way of torture -- nothing like today's movies with bath tubs of gore and screams so loud they launch your basilar membranes into a tarantella. Joan is feverish and faints and the good doctors bleed her, as is the custom of the day, and that's it for foreplay.But when she burns, it seems to take forever, and Falconetti's face goes through one expression after another, like a chameleon changing its pattern. It's too painful.Am I permitted to add a little note, not directly related to the film. In the last 1960s, the critic Stanley Kaufmann was teaching film appreciation at Columbia. He showed this movie and asked for responses. They ranged all over, comparing it to Preminger's movie about Jean Darc, the actual historical figure from both the French and English perspectives, and so on. It was one of the reasons Kaufmann was prompted to write \"The Film Generation,\" predicting that in the future classical movies would have virtually replaced literature as the principal art form. Within twenty years, he retracted his prediction, having found that in the intervening years the intellectual reach of his students had regressed to the mean, or perhaps dropped below it.

It is of course in black and white. But the camera still catches a rather circular image with shades in the corners. But the shooting and the acting, the editing and the text are first class.The movements of all the monks, priests and other church people always in a small crowd in a limited space is impressive in movement and composition to impress the audience of course, but to create an atmosphere in which the little and only woman of the whole film has to feel surrounded and is impressed and even psychologically pressurized, put under duress, manipulated into fear and angst. That gives Joan of Arc a tremendous power in her very unimpressionable lack of movement, frozen reactions, emotional restraint and yet constant suffering shown by the many tears she sheds.The camera of the time is better for close-up shots on one character, one face, one action or movement and Dreyer uses that camera to the utmost. No conventional emotional expressions. Everything has to look real and natural, even when it is the ferocious fierce authority of these doctors and higher-ups of the church. Most of them are grotesque older men who look absolutely devilish in their smiles, their laughter or their piercing looks trying to nail Joan of Arc on the spot.Dreyer thus can naturally avoid the real torture scenes and can deal with that sequence in an allusive and indirect mental way. We can see the machines but we do not see the real brutality imposed to Joan of Arc? Our imagination has to compensate. That is good because Dreyer's art is emotionally evocative when he is dealing with physical pain and torments. He can thus concentrate on the faces and their expressions. Dreyer is thus able to avoid the symbolism of silent films at the time, that symbolical acting that was so conventional and we can find a lot in Fritz Lang (though Fritz Lang also uses metaphorical symbolism) and in Hollywood that is producing at the time more comedies and comic farces than dramas and tragedies. The Russians are in another style with Eisenstein, more demonstrative, more political and ideological.And that's where Dreyer's film is slightly weak. The whole film is a miracle of human expressivity that builds up the real atmosphere in this old century when religion was the only reference, Jesus was a real being you could talk to, God was another real character you could easily see in your sleep. The whole social life was dictated by this clerical catholic faith. The film shows marvellously how the faith of one can become the heresy of the other, not because the other is necessarily vicious, but just because the one used the wrong word, a word that means the devil in the language of the church. The church and its official beliefs at any time (and these beliefs can change with time) are the only yardstick everyone uses, Joan of Arc as well as the church officials in Rouen. But her declared faith in Jesus and God becomes for the priests and the monks, the abbots and the bishops the evidence she is possessed because she uses a direct address to Jesus or God and pretends she can communicate with them, which is not possible in this church at the time since communication with God and Jesus could only come through the priest and mostly from the top to the bottom, from God to the people, but through the priest.Was Joan of Arc announcing the coming of the Reformation and the Protestant faith? Probably. The Middle Ages were coming to an end and the new spirit that gave the individual a tremendously more important role to play was already coming up.But at the end of the film Dreyer falls in the trap of a popular upheaval against the English and a political conclusion about Joan of Arc and the French. Joan of Arc started something important in Europe and not only in France. She announces, represents the birth of nations which are going to bring in due time the end of feudalism. In this case, the birth of a French national feeling that will take two centuries to become something stable and real. The defeat of the English on the continent with their defeat in the One-Hundred-Year war is going to push England back into its borders and the national feeling is going to develop there faster because it is an island and because the last feudal entity, the Holy Roman Empire of Charles Quint and Philip II of Spain will make the mistake of attacking England that had been the first country to nationalize their church and religion in the European world at the time, more than two centuries before the French Revolution does the same in, France.That complexity is not captured by Dreyer in his conclusion though he shows marvellously well how the feudal absolute control of the church on the people is coming to an end because individuals do not follow rules but follow their conscience, their intimate conviction. That is new indeed.Spend some time on this brand new restored version of the film.

She gives an extremely sympathetic and powerful performance and draws you to her. You cannot watch her face without feeling as she does and this, combined with Carl Dreyer's direction creates the illusion of reality and the 'suspension of disbelief' is complete.I thought the use of close-ups was very effective, as much of the film is comprised of them, particularly the harshness of the faces of her tormentors contrasted with the softness of Joan's. I have seen one other of Dreyer's films, \"Days of Wrath\", and felt the same stark realism and authenticity as depicted here.

Joan is played magnificently by Renee Jeanne Falconetti, who so convincingly portrays the future saints' emotional character so well. Her performance has been hailed by many as one of the best ever captured on film. The transcript of her trial is used as the basis, with judges on a panel interrogating Joan and doubting her message from above, to drive the English from France. Even under torture, she never relents, and it is not a spoiler to mention the burning at the stake, which is not a secret.

It has to be so, and you have to make sure. I believe that you have to be versatile and familiar with a lot of films, but let really few touch you, if the touch is to matter at all. My practice is that I normally resist emotional content and think less of films that solely try to exploit the fact we are, by nature, emotional beings, this being our weakness, and that is because most filmmakers, even a lot of otherwise great ones, are really tactless with these things to allow them into my life in that capacity. They are quick to wound and anxious to heal you back.This I welcomed with no resistance. This is the most sorrowful cadence, purely concentrated interior space until the last minute. And it is, perhaps, the most spiritual film I have seen, quite apart from the obvious fact that it deals with god and transcendent faith.Knowing this was altogether lost to us until very recently, and the chances it would be at all rediscovered really nonexistent, makes me feel like Nietzche confronted with the horse in Turin. So much beauty just a short step from being so casually erased from ever getting to know about it. But we did, and it wasn't. And how it was discovered is equally stunning, I mean can you imagine the chain of events? An original copy somehow ended up in a Danish mental asylum, and was it screened at all there? Did it mend some broken soul? Did the preacher let it do his preaching? And the cabinet opened 50 years down the line, the film is there. What are the chances?And Maria Falconetti, the most mysterious figure in all of cinema with only this major role to her credit. Did she go insane from too much pain, as portrayed here? Did she open a brothel in Argentina, as rumored? Suicide? Or, so much more ingloriously, died from a crash-diet?Further back in time, a teenage peasant girl in armor leading armies into battle and lifting sieges, guided by visions - god or madness, it doesn't matter, the words describe one thing. Her complete testimony before a mock trial survived and from the hands of her captors. Again, what are the chances? So folks, let the multi-faceted story of this film being made sooth and guide you home. Because it is a stranger world than anyone captured on film.Because all we have between us is testimonies of life, no doubt doctored, in our case by notaries at Rouen, the doctored version presented as truth, the truth always mediated by who's telling the story; we have blurred roles and so hard to surmise the real being, the woman as maiden, mad saint, icon, soldier, visionary actress, whore, real or imagined; we have staged fiction to frame our experience, mock trial, private dealings, confession, Sacrament, public execution, our film about these things, lost and foung again. And so, having caught a glimpse of this fabric that is chaotic, arbitrary life behind the images and stories we devise as scaffold to support a shape, we may concede at last that it's a world spinning madly out of orbit, beyond anyone's control except who writes the stories. Did god ever speak to her?Except for one thing, that we have this film and performance about a woman having visions as our vision about her. This is our center, a woman appearing before a camera some time in 1927.This is our spiritual center, and it is fitting that this maelstrom of a performance will be forever associated with and help explain a legend. This is where the divine madness of god speaks. In the utter, unbreakable, single-pointed concentration this woman and the man filming her embodied and sustained, this is the essence of spirituality.I'm not just babbling here. I know of only one image where god appears, not the traditional god but the state of mind that might as well be described in those terms. It is the picture of Buddhist monk Thich Quang Duc's self-immolation at Saigon. A human being sitting calmly in the lotus position as flames surge out of him.Oh, Falconetti is ravaged by emotion throughout and far from Guang Duc's meditative dispassion, a very Christian image of torment, a very Lutheran film, grim, recoiling under the gaze of an austere god, but it is very much the performance of a woman transforming herself into pure soul.

Like reading a book a silent film lets more of your own imagination fill in the blanks; there's more participation.

He took cinema into sacrilegious areas and instilled ideas about the existence of a deity. These theocentric and glorious disembowelling of the truth of this and the truth of death are amongst a subject matter, which was picked up by Goddard, Bergman and Allen. It's good to know that it has been done, but Dreyer was ahead of this in condensing philosophical things to his films, such as this film, Vampyr and Ordet. What makes him more potent then Bergman (given that Bergman is a genius and undeniably knew how to make a film that tried to thwart any believe that he wanted to debunk. Powerful example of this is found in \"Winter Light\" (1963)), but let's just say Bergman tried a film that represented symbols rather than words. In Prison (1949), a film in which he dismissed as terrible, he uses visual ideas in quite crude ways. It's an anticlerical film in a way and it showed his passion in silent cinema, until he formalised his own approach head on. But he took ideas and brought them into nuanced complexity. Dreyer wanted to actually bring forth something as a standalone work and he never really wanted his opinion to be influenced into his films. I even think Bergman liked Dreyer; his works seemed to be influenced by him. Dreyer was a Danish director; he was one of the first masters of abstract images. It's bizarre to see overtly on his IMDb credits that his first film was \"The President\" made in 1919, even though it tackled similar ideas, it's unlike anything that his style encompasses. I discovered him by a feature that I fell in love with called \"Vampyr\" 1932; its mysticism, demythologising of the vampire and technological effects that set the way we move in Allan Grey's ventures, where he enters a world that we shouldn't have entered and he shouldn't have either is amazing and the demonology of the film is in my opinion really overlooked. It exploits death in such a way especially how Leone died by a ghost we don't see (similar to \"Blood of a Poet\" when Jean's character peaks through a painting to see a cowboy shooting a gun \u2013 the same nervous effect). The film is expressionistic, dominantly white and metaphorically about us as thinatophiles and in doing this, reifying legendary figures. When the Vampires Accomplice gets killed, the ending is perfect because it's a time glass and it symbolises the memento mori and again we want to see this guy die because he wants to see others die as well. And then it segues into the forest where Allan and the affected of woman go off into the sun, the first mammoth bit of life in the condition of the films environment. Enticed by the shadows of figures and interiors of cavernous places, it's no doubt a fantastic film and heavily overlooked. The power is understated, but gloriously executed. I had been excited about \"Passion\" for a long time; \"The President\" (1919), \"Mikhail\" (1924) and \"Master of House\" (1925) are the only silent films I was aware of that he made. I then dabbled into film documentaries (one of which was the episodic \"Story of Film\" by Mark Cousins) and I found out more about the realist film maker and this made me even more serious about getting it. It was a criterion edition I purchased and it came through last week. With those few films mentioned into consideration, Dreyer makes a foray into detailing Joan's story \u2013 The accuracy is diminished slightly, ultimately to accommodate the drama of the story, and instead Dreyer employs Marinee Falcolnetti as Jeanne D'arc and it's the most beautifully lit face in all of pantomime in cinema. There are a lot more that are probably better actors during that era, but it's an unequalled accomplishment to give such a resonance, simply with close ups (and it looks nearly like macro photography and this was during a time where these innovations weren't even around). I love seeing her response for salvation of soul, as if the apotheosis is manifestos. I don't believe anything that is said by Joan, but taking her impassioned words in this film, which are to me probably false and seeing how she goes against them, shows us the rigour of that terrible system. The film interlinks objects with emotions and takes different accounts very serious. I nearly cried in the first half of it and as it culminated calamitously. Dreyer used a panning shot very infrequently when he showed the judges and there's one scene where the camera pans right down one of their faces and then it cuts to Jeanne in a state of despair about where she leaned the prayer from. The judges don't hate her, but rather that they hate her mendacity and hubris ways, which make them hypocritical just because she wants to help people. Two Judges plea that she is a saint and didn't stem from the Devil, but from God. As if by envy of her accomplishments in helping people, they refuse to accept any verisimilitude of the trial. Trust me, the subtle moments of cinematography such as when the people come in with the weapons or when they're getting out the stake and the unbelievable part when they tell her that the King wrote a letter just to get her to put down a signature to death, hits the emotional side, not because it's playing for poignancy, but because of the woe of it So while probably not the most accurate version of the story (I have yet to see Demille's \"Joan the Woman\" and actually read up on it), this is a bravura film and is close to being the best Dreyer film I have seen.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 3}, "heading": "Compositions that will never leave you and emotions that will haunt me each viewing of the film", "date": "2011-10-28T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2509792", "sentiment score": [0.0847, 0.2184, 0.2427, 0.3065, 0.1478]}, {"content": "Never had the torment of a woman been as beautifully portrayed, inspiring nothing but pure sympathy, as in Dryer's silent masterpiece, \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\", pure sympathy in the Christian meaning of the word, and I'm not even Christian.I can't describe the emotion that tunnels me through Falconetti's eyes; words are feeble, futile, risible, such a performance can't be praised enough, it's like the divine touch of Joan of Arc really embraced Falconetti, she WAS Joan of Arc reincarnated on celluloid, it's even as if Carl Theodore Dryer traveled in time and shot the real trial of Joan of Arc \u0085 I know, this is from Jean Cocteau, but I'm only paraphrasing what is probably the feeling of a vast majority.We will never know how God inspired Joan to resist to the English Invasion during the Hundred Years War, and it's only fitting that this unintelligibility is featured in a silent film. What we see is an ounce of divinity inhabiting the eyes of Falconetti, this life in her eyes is the guiding light that comes from the bottom of her soul, we see but we can't reach it, because Dryer doesn't deify the heroin, not even make a martyr out of her. Indeed, if one word could describe Joan of Arc in the film, it's a vulnerable, poignant and heart-breaking humanity. Her face provides such a wide range of emotions that she hypnotically embodies the weakness of a woman harassed by a bunch of heartless judges, scared to death, scared OF death, yet she stands for her convictions. Her body betrays her emotions, but her eyes resist, her eyes mirror the true strength of her soul: an unflappable faith.Dryer's directorial work also deserves praises for the significant part it plays in the film, if you combine it with the editing and the screenplay. The movie is a period drama, but there are no castles, no riding knights, no feasts, no battles, except for the chaotic execution's aftermath. And the trial is only an excuse for probably the first cinematic character study, centered on one of the most legendary heroin that even graced the course of humanity's history, and God knows not enough women did what Joan did. Joan of Arc defines the very word of heroin as someone who's anything but a victim, choosing her fate, her destiny, not out of bravery but despite her fears. It's easy to die when you're not afraid of dying, but never heroism can be displayed without something precious at stakes. In the case of Joan, how could have she discredited her belief that God came to her ... to save her life?! What was the point of living after that? Like for any hero, there's the pivotal test, when she's subtly lured into signing the infamous paper that would saved her from excommunication, from the bonfire, at her integrity's price. But when she realized she signed out of fear, she immediately retracted and symbolically signed her own death warrant. How could she lie to herself when her eyes breathed the truth in its purest form? This is what the story is about, Joan's passion, a passion transmitted to the crowd when her head was shaved, when she carried the cross, when she burnt on the bonfire. Joan embodied a Christ-like martyrdom, sadder than inspiring, we feel sad because she's human, mortal and vulnerable. For the judges, the crime isn't even blasphemy, it's pretension. They mock her, shout at her, even condescendingly laugh, but there's always one moment where her eyes manage to penetrate the soul of one of them, and for a brief instant, one heart is touched by a sort of ephemeral light betrayed by one imperceptible facial expression.On that department, the movie is a school case. I said it's not a period drama made on a epic scale, it's not even on the scale of a trial film. The whole film is made of countless cuts and close-ups with a close to perfect capability to convey the right feeling. The film is a masterpiece, not just by silent films' standards, it reaches a level of artistic greatness independent from any attempt to tell a story. Look at the film even without that haunting medieval music and you'll still find yourself transported by these eyes, these facial expressions, even the wrinkles on the faces, the severity of a closed mouth, emphasize the nightmarish feeling endured by Joan. The camera is always kept low with the antagonists as to reinforce their powerful position, while Joan is under the camera with her eyes looking in God's direction. Whenever she feels weak, she looks down then turn her eyes to God, at times, her eyes move in every direction, when she's panic-stricken as any 'weak' woman, but ultimately, she recovers the extreme serenity of a privileged human being touched by the divine grace.Yet, at the end, she's still scared, and when she finally meets God, you can tell on people's eyes, the guilt carried on their heart, to have allowed such a martyrdom to happen. What follows is a chaotic violent battle, that leaves us almost emotionless because Falconnetti drained all our emotions, and we're simply exhausted after such an intense and disturbing experience.

Unlike the typical biographical film, this one is based completely on the court proceedings in the trial of Joan--not some fictional or semi-fictional story written in 1928. This is pretty wild, as many historical films view truth as very flexible--with the real emphasis being on entertainment. If this means inventing characters or changing history--so be it! But, fortunately, not in this film! It's a history teacher's delight! When the film began, I sure was bowled over by the powerful soundtrack filled with Latin liturgical singing. While annoying normally, here with the intensity of the film and the subject matter is managed to work. In addition, the film is an artistic piece due to the director Dreyer's artistic vision. First, his choices of actors was truly amazing--as he chose some of the most amazing faces I've seen in a film--such character, such intensity and such acting from these people is truly amazing. Plus the camera pulls so much from the actors due to fantastic lighting and clarity of focus--you can even very clearly see the pores on many of the actor's faces! Second, unlike almost all other silent films and even sound ones, this one makes great use of closeups and inventive camera angles to heighten the intensity of the action as well as the impact on the audience. The result is a film that hits you in the face--hard, forceful and impossible to ignore. Especially strong in its impact is the execution itself--Dreyer chose to make incredibly vivid (so much so, some might find it very disturbing).Now I must say that although I greatly admired this, there was, at times, a downside. The actress that played Joan (Maria Falconetti) often looked downright crazed--like she was off her medication and reeeaalllly needed it!! While this could actually be true (after all, she was seeing things and having conversations with dead folks), I doubt if Dreyer wanted his audience to think Joan of Arc was nuts--as she so often appeared in the film. This is sad, really, as at other times, Ms. Falconetti did a masterful job--showing great sorrow and crying most convincingly. But, in many cases, after crying and emoting wonderfully, moments later she was staring off into space like she was stoned. I know this film is considered one of the great films of the silent age, but I don't know how this can be based on the truly bizarre and inconsistent characterization of Joan.

The Passion Of Joan Of Arc made at the tail end of silent films give an actress normally associated with comedy a chance to give an astonishing interpretation of the maid. It also gives us the only recorded performance of Maria Falconetti to treasure.Directed and written by Carl Dreyer, the sets are a bare basic item in this film, there only to establish a time and place. We see none of Joan's deeds of heroism, this film only concerns us with her trial and execution. And in an interesting and successful technique the entire film is told in closeups, more closeups than I've ever seen used before in any film. As she's interrogated by the Bishop of Cauchon who was in the pay of England's ally the Duke of Burgundy. The film cuts back and forth to closeup shots of the interrogators and then to Falconetti. Her expressions and her tears even without dialog create the image of the frightened and pure saint like girl just trying to do the right thing and stand by her conviction that she's been singled out to save France.At least to my eye Falconetti bore more than a slight resemblance to Anna Magnani and I'm betting if talkies had been available she would have sounded like her as well.There have been modern interpretations that Joan Of Arc might well have been a lesbian. What was really bothering her accusers was the fact that she was in male attire. Now leaving the question of sexual orientation aside, even if all that Joan was, was a symbol just getting around a battlefield might require the clothing that a soldier might wear. It wouldn't be practical to be wearing a farm dress. And certainly if one was participating in the battle it would be foolish.But the male attire seemed to be what got the accusers going. They harped on it constantly during the interrogation. If this was proof that the Maid was a lesbian, than surely she was in league with satanic forces.Depending on your point of view it could range from Joan actually hearing the voice of God to some hallucinatory ramblings from some kind of native intoxicant. Whatever it was she was convinced they came from heaven and more importantly she convinced others. It's why she remains France's national heroine and why she's such a challenging role for so many actresses.

Joan of Arc had \"led\" the pro-papist (\"conservative\") French forces that installed pro-papist king Charles 7th to the throne during the Hundred Years War against the English in the early 15th century. She may have been canonized for her role in \"saving France for Holy Roman Church,\" but she is also seen by many in France as the savior of the culture in the face of a very serious foreign threat. Some saw French politics in the '20s and '30s as strikingly parallel to the politics of Joan's time. A prisoner of his very divided College of Cardinals (many from the Central Powers), Pius 10th stood on the sidelines as Germany and Austria-Hungary set about dismantling the rest of the Continent.

What's immediately apparent when comparing these two films, is how focused Dreyer is on showing the opposing forces present at Joan's trial. Who was the chief architect of her martyrdom? The English invaders who imprisoned her? The French clergy who tried and condemned her? God? The girl herself? The people who identified with her and gave her martyrdom political purpose? 2. Dreyer always keeps Joan isolated within the frame, plumbing a solitary soul's duress under persecution. Elsewhere he deftly shows the transformation of the witnessing masses from a crazy mob into a responsible voice of moral protest.3. Maria Falconetti, who plays Joan in Dreyer's film, is given some of the most celebrated close ups in cinema history. What became of her? One legend claims that she so identified with her one major film role that she ended up in an insane asylum, convinced she was Joan.4. Unlike Dreyer's film, Bresson's is filled with non professional actors. His is a dry, almost distant film.5. Whilst Dreyer's film oozes grand emotions, Bresson's is modern, minimalist and existentially blunt.6. Bresson avoids the circus and stresses Joan's solitude. His Joan is defiant in court, but privately she is at a loss, constantly praying for answers.7. Dreyer's Joan (a kind of instinctual folk hero) acts according to her feelings, while Bresson's acts according to her conscience, which fluctuate as she broods.8. Bresson's Joan is actually reluctant to embrace martyrdom. She's in over her head, unsure, confused.9. In Dreyer's film, the audience becomes both Joan and the masses supporting her. In Bresson's, however, the audience is positioned as an outsider. We're the prison guards, the jailers, the priests, always \"seperated\" from Joan (by holes, by walls, by bars). The poor girl's kept at a distance.10. Bresson's film is filled with visual echoes. Joan's hands, chained across a bible, resemble a pair of wings. At her execution, her hands, now tied behind her back, reappear in closeup. When doves appear, shot from below, we are reminded of Joan's \"winged\" hands to haunting effect. The point: an image of confinement has become one of ultimate liberation.11. Bresson's film begins with two sounds: the ringing of church bells, followed by a drum roll. It ends only with a drum roll. Joan silences the Church that has put her to death.12. Bresson has criticised Dreyer's film on numerous occasions, stating that he found the acting \"grotesque\". He's right. Joan was a hardened warrior who fought with men. Why then does Dreyer portray her in such a melodramatic fashion? On the flip side, Dreyer's images do tap into something almost primal.13. Bresson's film abounds with delicious ambiguities. Was Joan really receiving messages from God? Is she deluded? Was she a crazy freedom fighter or holy saint? Was she simply a 15th century terrorist, opposing the English occupying army and the tents of the Catholic Church? 8.9/10 - \"The Trial of Joan of Arc\"8/10 - \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" Both masterpieces, though I personally prefer Bresson's austere approach.

However, though so often neglected, forgotten for years, considered 'lost', it appears to rise again after a few generations in order to overwhelm a totally different audience...This film, having experienced a strange fate of storms and fires, had to wait for decades in the dust of forgotten past in order to be acclaimed one of the true classics of cinema, one of its most genuine achievements. And many people will perhaps agree with me that its story does not constitute the only reason for its success.The most significant aspect that makes LA PASSION DE JEANNE D'ARC so authentic nowadays are its humane depiction and realistic interpretation. It is not a hagiography of a saint who lived more than 500 years ago but a powerful insight into one of the most infamous trials in history when the daughter of God was found to be a daughter of Satan by...the 'holy' learned ecclesiastics. This trial, based on true notes, is presented in a unique, vivid manner where the viewer is stuck by merits galore characterized by profoundity of development, symbolism of visuals and simplicity of portrayals. Here, a necessary analysis must be made concerning the most significant merit of the movie, Marie Falconetti in the lead.Considering Marie Falconetti, I would like to refer to the words entailed in the New York Times article which discussed the 'poignant' French film that premiered at the dusk of silent era. \"as one witnesses her (Marie's) eyes filling with tears or perceives a faint grateful smile crossing her appealing countenance, one feels that it would be difficult indeed to elicit from any other actress such an eloquent interpretation as she gives in this production.\" Yes, Marie Falconetti gives a timeless, the most unique performance that appears to be as mesmerizing as it must have been in 1928. She executes the chain of various emotions from disappointment, shock, fear, sorrow, blissful hope, regret, to courageous dignifying faith. Her portrayal of a misguided lamb being found guilty, accused of heresy, tortured and executed by knowledgeable wolves is even more intensified by one more important aspect: close-ups.Indeed, the film can boast an unusual number of close-ups --- ones, as Gary Morris nicely put it (2000), \"among the most harrowing, claustrophobic ever.\" This strategy used so widely by director Dreyer makes the movie one ahead of its time, something innovative that introduced cinema to its more mature level of development. It also allows us to witness the whole drama on silver screen more intensely, feel sympathy for the main character while her bitter experience of the unjust accusations and satanic furies of the 'decent.' Throughout the movie, her face appears to represent the purity, upright heart, courage and holiness as contrasted to the wretched faces of wrath, corruption, hypocrisy and misery.Besides, you can find lots of memorable moments thanks to Dreyer's masterful direction and Rudolph Mate's brilliant cinematography. Who can possibly skip such memorable scenes like the faces of the judges (the cast with no make-ups - so rare for its period), detailed symbolism of single images like torture chamber or mockery of Joan's Christ-like figure, the emphasis on various images of the Cross as sort of metaphorical manifestation of the main character's mind and heart. I particularly liked the atmosphere close to the end when the viewer is truly led into the dramatic twilight of justice and, more to say, hope for justice. What seems to remain, what seems to be everlasting is... Love, the Love given by God, the Love that transforms and turns a dark night into a bright day: Joan takes the last Sacrament while the stake awaits her, the stake symbolizing earthly fire of destruction. These are the most powerful moments of the film. To make this experience even more unforgettable , I recommend you to see the film with Richard Einhorn's magnificent \"Voices of Light\" in the background. He wrote this music having seen the film and having been inspired by it.Summing it up, I will again refer to the words of Gary Morris who reviewed the film at its DVD release (2000): LA PASSION DE JEANNE D'ARC \"reverses the clich\u00e9 that 'life imitates art.\" Similarly to the Maid of Orleans, it was rejected, destroyed by fire, forgotten; yet, when everything seems to be over, the genuine power of honest art strangely triumphs, does triumph like Joan who was canonized 5 centuries after her infamous execution. Perhaps, it has a message for us, she has a message for us, a touching but universal message for humanity and about humanity: its rises and falls, its deaths and triumphs heard in the astonishing sound of silence.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 3}, "heading": "Something Only Silent Era Could Execute, Something Only Silence Can Still Achieve...", "date": "2009-11-01T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2150626", "sentiment score": [0.0286, 0.1077, 0.1862, 0.4543, 0.2231]}, {"content": "Along side Marion Cotillard of la Vie en Rose, and Meryl Streep of Sophie's Choice, Rosaura Revueltas of Salt of the Earth and Jessica Lange of Rob Roy, Maria Falconetti's Joan of Arc is a masterwork of the cinematic arts.Although it deserves to be rated as one of the best films of all time, let this beautiful work stay in obscurity to be seen only by those who seek it out.

In a medium without words, where the filmmakers conceived that the camera seized the heart of characters through their faces, to see Falconetti in Dreyer's landmark is to look into electric, almost extrasensory eyes that will never relinquish you. She also embodies Joan with an unrelenting monastic guilelessness, moving as if in a dream, her body language so slow and meditative. She answers questions in taut earnest.Dreyer had been given a large budget and a screenplay by his French producers, but he sacked the screenplay and turned in lieu to the archives of Joan's trial. They told the account that has become folklore: of how a rustic provincial girl, dressed as a boy, led the French troops in their triumph over the British occupation forces. How she was captured by French loyal to the British and brought before a church court, where her conviction that she had been emboldened by celestial apparitions led to accusations of blasphemy. There were many cross-examinations, supplemented by torment, before Joan was burned at the stake. Dreyer coalesces them into one trial, in which the judges, their faces wrenched with their alarm at her dauntlessness, hover over her with roars and charges. Men here who think they represent God are the cruelest to her. She remains undeterred. Believing her would compromise their beliefs. So she is punished for the same thing that drives them to punish her: Faith.There is not one single establishing shot in all of Dreyer's passion play, which is filmed with eccentric, idealistic mystery by Rudolph Mate completely in closeups and medium shots, creating apprehensive proximity between Joan and her oppressors. Nor are there freely interpreted perceptible connections between shots. What does this signify to us? There is a lexicon of shooting and editing that we subliminally presume at the movies. We figure that if two people are talking, the cuts will make it appear that they are facing one another. We expect that if a judge is challenging a defendant, the camera position and editing will make it evident where they stand regarding each other. If we see three people in a room, we presume to be able to say how they are situated and which is nearest to the camera. Almost all such visual expectations are absent from this film, replaced by an all-encompassing disjointed effect.Alternatively, the placement of cuts shapes the film into a sequence of surprising panchromatic imagery. The prison guards and the ecclesiastics on the court are seen in high contrast, frequently from a low angle, and although there are frequently knifelike structural shapes behind them, we are not certain precisely what the distance is. There is a shot of three priests, likely positioned from front to back, but shot in such a way that their heads appear piled on top of each other. All of the faces of the inquisitors are shot in bright light, without makeup, so that the clefts and blemishes of their skin appear to evince an ailing internal life.Falconetti, in comparison, is shot in more delicate grays, instead of blacks and whites. Also without makeup, she appears austere and absorbed by internal certainty. Solitude proves her only on-screen companion in the whole film. Note an exchange where a judge asks her whether St. Michael indeed spoke to her. Her serene face looks to propose that whatever happened between Michael and herself was so far outside the compass of the question that no answer is possible.Why did Dreyer splinter his space, obscure the visual impression and shoot in closeup? He might've wanted to eschew the refined snares of a historical drama. There is no landscape here, save walls and arches. Nothing was put in to look pleasing. You do not leave talking about costumes, granted they are all real. The preeminence of the faces asserts that these very people did what they did. Dreyer dismantles the church court of its ceremony and respectability and reveals its members as obese charlatans in the pay of the British. Their fixed eyes and mercenary mouths violate Joan's asceticism.To us contemporary audiences, accustomed to films where emotion is reflected by dialogue and action more than by faces, a film like this 1928 sequence of expressions is a disconcerting undertaking, so penetrating we worry we will unearth more occult than we wish, although watching with the Visions of Light soundtrack makes a hugely profound difference. It is deeply moving music, and also allows a less demanding experience from a modern audience. It is a testament to the film's power that it also features a performance by Antonin Artaud, who wrote of a need for a \"Theatre of Cruelty,\" by which he meant a fierce, physical grit to eradicate false reality. He believed that text had been a bully over subject and implication, and wanted in its place a theatre comprised of a unique language halfway between concept and action. Our compassion is provoked so vigorously for Joan that Dreyer's visual methods don't even play like aesthetic decisions, but like the remnants of Joan's experience. Depleted, emaciated, frozen, in perpetual despair, merely 19 when she died, she lives in a chimera where the faces of her tyrants surge like savage nightmares.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 3}, "heading": "The Overwhelming Power of the Human Face", "date": "2009-10-15T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2141221", "sentiment score": [0.1153, 0.2266, 0.2013, 0.3135, 0.1433]}, {"content": "Given the title, you might think I wrote this just to praise the creation.Well it's not just that.

The film was initially censored. Then the negative was destroyed. A second negative somehow survived but went undiscovered for fifty years.The film is unusual in several regards. First, it has very little action. A big part of the film is the interrogation of Jeanne by Church hierarchy, hostile old men who fear her dedication and inner conviction. Second, camera shots are mostly close-ups, or of medium range. This strips images of background distractions in the interrogation sessions. Props and scenery are thus either absent or largely irrelevant.The only consideration is the interplay between Jeanne and her tormentors. Camera lighting is bright when focused on the faces of the monks and judges. And none of the actors wore makeup, another unusual trait of this film. The visuals thus present these men as forces of darkness, looking hideous, barbaric, and cruel, unable to hide behind their righteousness or religious ritual.By contrast, Jeanne comes across as sincere, courageous, honest, and unwavering in her convictions. Falconetti gives a really fine performance. Some critics regard it as one of the greatest performances in film history. Falconetti seems to have the ability to cry on cue.After the interrogation, Jeanne is led outdoors where she is roped to a stake. The townsfolk gather to watch. Their sympathies, judged by their crying and grim faces, clearly side with Jeanne. The film's climax is uncompromising. The images at the end are quite potent.This is a true story of a lone individual up against an arrogant, institutional bully. No wonder Jeanne d'Arc is now regarded as a Saint.

Joan's story is uncannily similar to the story of Christ\u0097both were viewed as extremists; both were thought to be a threat to political power; both were told to deny their beliefs by a group of tyrannical clergymen; and both were ultimately murdered for their convictions. Joan, like Christ, becomes more and more at a loss of words as she is vehemently interrogated, knowing full well that her words are futile and that death awaits her. Her silence, in many instances, parallels the silence of Christ and is perhaps the most powerful testimony she gives against the brooding Englishmen who enslaved her.Her story is also strangely similar to Joseph Smith\u0097for why else would such a seemingly insignificant character as nineteen-year old girl, Joan, attract the attention of the great ones of the most popular sects of the day, and in them a spirit of the most bitter persecution and reviling? Some would argue that it was due to Joan's military status in the French army, and though indeed that might be partly true, I don't believe it's the full truth. There must have been something more in Joan's testimony that caused such \"great ones\" to behold her as a threat to the entire English government. I mean, why would a mere denial of her \"vision of God\" be enough to satiate these blood-thirsty hypocrites? There must have been something else driving their motives. Nevertheless, I find it very peculiar that she was greatly feared amongst such \"powerful men.\" Extreme close-ups are used quite abundantly throughout the entirety of the film to help show the exhaustion of Joan. I believe this technique was used to capture how violated she must have felt: nothing but angry faces ranting and railing up-close against her, as if Dreyer was purposely trying to attack the audience so that they could live vicariously through her torment. One close-up after the next, we see the deterioration of Joan as her life is fed to entropy\u0097the audience feels equally as deteriorated by the end too. I think the use of close-ups was incredibly powerful. They allowed for a type of transcendence to occur. This transcendence takes the form of seeing the life in Joan's face fade more and more; concurrently the audience prays for her spirit to transcend the pangs of her body and be freed from the hell she experiences on earth.The film, in this sense, has a very transcendental quality. Though the audience may never have to experience a martyrdom like Joan or Christ, they will feel the desire to want to be freed from their own physical bondage, pain and suffering. The film is silent, and as such, creates a sparse-style of transcendence\u0097something that speaks softly to the soul, unlike DeMille's abundant-style in The Ten Commandments. It offers a lot of room for reflection as we sit there beholding these intense images in holy silence.Having mentioned transcendence, I believe the film has much to say about the relationship between salvation and man. As Joan is being savagely questioned about her \"vision of God,\" the clergy keep reminding her that her sins can be forgiven in and through the Church. Never once do they mention that salvation comes through Christ, let alone God\u0097it's always through the authority of the Church. I think Dreyer is merely trying to remind the viewer what history books have already enlightened the world with: that there is something strange about salvation coming from a \"learned\" group of men who appear pious and holy devout to the Divine, but who lack inner-conviction and act as wolves dressed in sheep's clothing. \"By their fruits ye shall know them,\" seems to be the underlying theme to this film. These men do not emit the qualities of goodness\u0097they are depicted as fearful and angry; they stop at nothing to force Joan to confess a false testimony. They are like the Pharisees of old who attacked and stoned the prophets all to maintain and secure the appearance of godliness. Their fruits, however, reveal who they really are: tyrants of a brute nature.One quality I really respected and identified in Joan was her humanity. She wasn't depicted as some sinless warrior, let alone saint who was constantly in God's good standing, but at one moment succumbed to the frailty of her mortal condition and fell before God to preserve her life. In this moment, she renounced her vision in order to acquiesce to the Englishmen's desires. It was contrived though, and she knew it. Feeling the pangs of a guilty conscience, she immediately called back the guards and repented of her sin. I loved seeing this character arc in her because it made her even more real; more relatable; more human. This sequence demonstrated the power of repentance, and how even the noblest of God's children are not immune to the temptations of the body. All must immerse their lives in the principle of repentance (i.e. change from man's will to God's will). Though God's will is often very personal and nebulous, it is not to be determined by the will of \"learned, erudite scholars,\" but from careful adherence to what one considers is the right path.", "rating": 7, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 2, "votes": 5}, "heading": "Standing for Something", "date": "2009-03-08T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw2034492", "sentiment score": [0.0115, 0.0624, 0.2238, 0.5855, 0.1168]}, {"content": "This film is amazing on several counts. First, the cinematography is mind boggling: we've got tons of extreme closeups, lots of low angle shots, pans and swish pans, even upside down shots. Dreyer is using the camera to tell the story of Joan of Arc's trial for heresy and her being burned at the stake. Second, Dreyer wants the viewers to really become involved in the reality of the story. Like other films with unconventional takes on Jesus or other historical figures (such as by Martin Scorsese or Ken Russell), Carl Dreyer is really doing his own thing here, by telescoping her trial and execution into one day, without much referencing to her historical activities or character. In fact, Maria Falconetti portrays Joan as a naive, simple farm girl of deep faith, hardly conveying the image of someone capable of having led the French against the English. She spends most of her closeups either crying or saying \"Oui,\" looking wide eyed like a deer caught in the headlights. Dreyer must have been saying here that Joan (actually Jeanne) was resigned to the inescapability of her situation. (The film is titled 'The Passion of Joan of Arc' not 'The History of Joan of Arc.')Dreyer's whole purpose is to make the experience of her trial and death have a strong impact on the viewer. To further the reality of this, no makeup was used on any person, and the sets (when seen beyond the close-ups) were spare and almost bare, so as to not to detract from the interactions of the characters. Again, to emphasizes its reality, Dreyer introduces the story by showing that the dialogue in the film was taken directly from the real transcript of Joan's 1431 trial.Dreyer's most formal contemporary critic complained that the 'irksome monotony' and 'maniacal' use of closeups resulted in a loss of spatial orientation for the characters, that is, you couldn't always tell who they were looking at or addressing. There was hardly any sense of the characters being in a room at all. In fact, Eisenstein's response on seeing the film was to call it 'a collection of pictures.' For Dreyer, however, his mostly all closeups approach was to show and emphasize the conflict between Joan and her interrogators.But here's the thing: the impact of this film is undeniable. The intensity of the closeups accomplishes Dreyer's stated goal to shake up the audience and have them feel the suffering. Her being burned at the stake is equally uncompromising. As the scholar on the commentary track noted, this film makes most other films seem trivial.The film is a compendium of French, German and Russian film making techniques. It gets a 10.Note: The cinematographer, Rudolph Mate, who had previously worked extensively with Karl Freund, went on to his own successful career in the United States, showcasing Rita Hayworth and her hair in both 'Gilda' (1946) and 'The Lady From Shanghai' (1947)-- yes! the movie with the great Fun House Mirror shots, and as a director for 'When Worlds Collide' (1951), and the noir films 'Union Station' (1950) and 'D.O.A.'

Ms. Falconetti is teased and tortured. She is not able to read, and provides little information to the wicked judges. She says she is nineteen years old, \"Je pense,\" elle dit, but looks older. Director Carl Theodor Dreyer films Falconetti almost entirely in close-up. She widens her eyes, and emotes fiercely. It almost looks like a close-up screen test. Falconetti suffers well, responding to the director's commands. But it's hard to tell what she is emoting about; at times, she could be sitting on her toilet. Since she brushes a fly away from her face once or twice; it is likely true this film was made from originally rejected footage, after the original Dreyer edit was \"accidentally destroyed\".That this film is a compilation of outtakes explains (in part?) its flaws in style and storytelling.

Over the decades Dreyer's film was a victim of religious and politic censors, two fires that destroyed valuable prints, unauthorized cuts, and zealous editors working against his wishes to modernize the film. An original, uncensored cut was found miraculously in a Norwegian hospital for the mentally ill (ironic?) in 1981 and fully restored for the Criterion Collection. Famed composer Richard Einhorn created his libretto, \"Voices of Light\", in response to his own experiences viewing the film and researching the history of Joan of Arc. The film can be viewed with or without the accompaniment, though I can't imagine Dreyer would've objected as Einhorn with great care honored the spirit of the film and arguably of Saint Joan with his compositions.Carl Dreyer's silent film, \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\", is a shocking example of the potential of film as art. No amount of scholarly critique can account for the raw power in viewing the film. It's one of those rare experiences that can only be seen to be understood. Dreyer's meticulously crafted aesthetics (the film is almost entirely composed of close-ups of the actors' faces) are perfectly married to the gut wrenching performance of Maria Falconetti (a theater star who never acted in another film) in the lead role. I think Dreyer was most accurate in describing her performance as nothing short of \"the martyr's reincarnation.\" One need not be religious to understand what is meant or to feel for Joan as portrayed so humanely and exquisitely by Falconetti. Her face is beyond the realm of haunting, and Dreyer seers it into the audience's memory along with other stunning imagery like a window frame's shadow turning into a cross on the floor, worms crawling through a skull unearthed from a freshly dug grave, or a bored executioner barely able to hold up his head in the company of his torture devices. And then there's the burning at the stake and the brutal suppression of the peasant riot--unimaginable horrors rendered so beautifully and hyper realized onto a series of moving images projected onto a blank screen.The genius of Dreyer's visuals and Falconetti's performance is that they create a deep psychological complexity that can engage a modern viewer on multiple levels. In their bold suggestions and through the artistic integrity of their respective crafts, Dreyer and Falconetti leave it to their audience (weather it be a French nation still celebrating and mythologizing their 15th century hero Joan a mere eight years after her canonization in 1920 or a more skeptical 21st scholar studying the history of film) to decide the veracity of Joan's convictions. Was Joan truly a mystic, a martyr, a saint? Or was she simply mad and the unfortunate victim of the time period in which she lived and died? Either way, she is presented here as human. And in relating to her, one thing is for sure: the mysticism of film was realized by the Dane Carl Dreyer and Maria Falconetti in the year 1928 with \"The Passion of Joan of Arc.\"", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 11, "votes": 18}, "heading": "Dreyer's \"Realized Mysticism\"", "date": "2008-06-07T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1888128", "sentiment score": [0.0944, 0.1646, 0.305, 0.3404, 0.0956]}, {"content": "Passion of Joan of Arc, The (1928) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Carl Theodor Dreyer's film about Joan of Arc's trial, torture and eventual burning at the stake is certainly a landmark film but I feel this is a case where there's too much style and not enough substance.I'm going to give a film another viewing but with my first viewing most of my attention was with the incredibly style.

His direction is always exceptionally controlled and crafted and for me this film encapsulates succinctly his dual expressionistic and formalistic approach to cinema. Although Dreyer succeeds in creating an extremely credible depiction of the trial and tribulation of Joan of Arc, he knew the filmic medium was not, and never could be, knowledge, fact or reality, and so he presents experience, truth and authenticity.The film can be argued to be entirely shot from the mind's-eye view of Joan in relation to her locality to give the impression that we, as Roger Ebert said, are not watching a film but in fact watching \"fragments from Joan's own experience\". Hence, the reason why everything is filmed in either, close-ups or medium shots, the reason why there are no establishing shots and very few visual linkages. Filming in this way also created the intended affect of overwhelming claustrophobia and discomfort for the audience- a mediation of persecution one could say.A lot has been said on Dreyer's inspirational use of the facial close-up in this film. His attention to the details on his performers faces, such as lines, warts, freckles, sweat and hair, and even on two occasions a fly, are used as revelations to their character and personality. The insignificant is made significant. Their faces are filmed in such a purist, \"microscopic\" fashion (no make-up was permitted by Dreyer) that their features and expressions convey a deeper more profound understanding of their emotions and thinking than words ever could. Renee Falconetti's face is also almost always seen in isolated shots and often filmed from a height thus accentuating her spiritual solitude and physical defencelessness. In contrast the trial judges and their faces are often shot from below, accentuating their threat to Joan and their dominance over her. Also her face is never in shadow and often captured in grey whereas the judges are always shot in shadow and have a more defined black and white composure, emblematic I believe of their inner good and bad. The acting is superlative undoubtedly helped though by Dreyer's cruel and unrelenting treatment of his actors. Dreyer became a notoriously demanding and dictatorial director after this film. He reportedly drove its star Falconetti into a mental breakdown in order to get the right emotional intensity he desired for the film. His pursuit for total realism, or to be more exact total authenticity, knew no bounds. The scene were Joan suffers a bloodletting was in fact real, albeit from a stand-ins arm. Falconetti never made another film again, yet her performance, I among others, deem as being arguably the finest ever filmed. Everything about this film is manipulated to convey the mind-set of Joan, her disturbed emotions and confused thinking, as well as her physical vulnerability and spiritual purity. Also anything that is not important to the conveyance of Joan's condition and situation is not included, hence the massive and very expensive set that was built but very little of it used. All the images presented conceivably convey what she could have seen and the way she might have seen it. Hence, the reason I believe for the upside down and backward shot of the English soldiers entering the gates of the castle, possibly a symbolic reference to St. Peter being crucified upside down, as allegorical parallels can be drawn with the historical story of Joan and the Biblical one of St Peter. Also, the swinging camera that makes the tower appear to be moving while she is burning is I believe a subjective representation of Joan's mental and physical suffering and the fact that she is about to depart from the earth. Either way these are certainly not just stylistic flourishes. The angular composition of the trial judges in relation to Joan and her relation to them, the off-kilter framing showing sometimes only half a head or at least only the head, and the fact that the judges are filmed moving in to and out of the frame only enhance capturing Joan's mental state of mind and her sincerity and honesty in the face of her Pietistic and duplicitous accusers. Furthermore, the weird and bizarre set designs from Hermann Warm, famous for his expressionist sets for The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari, only add to the disillusioning and disturbing overall effect for the viewer.The themes of this film are also present in many of Dreyer's other works, namely his fascination with the incompatibility of institutionalised religion and individual faith, the physical dominance of the male over the female (somewhat dated now), and the power of the human soul over earthly ambitions and corruption. These themes appear to be of personal significance to Dreyer in nearly all his films. There is humanity and a desire to create sympathy, and not indifference, towards all his characters in his films.The Passion of Joan of Arc is an aesthetically austere yet serenely beautiful, psychologically uncompromising yet spiritually moving piece of work. The 15 hundred cuts and the way the film is structured, in clearly defined chapters, and, as already discussed, the way it is shot in close locality to Joan and always in relation to her immediate surroundings, gives the deceptive impression of simplicity and naturalness, whereas in fact the film is highly sophisticated and stylised. It also makes what Jean Cocteau said about the film even more true. That was, that it played like \"an historical document from an era in which cinema didn't exist\".

The faces and facial expressions really tell the story of the movie.

Renee Falconetti, in the only performance she ever committed to film, is just about as flawless as an actress can be as the persecuted French woman who is sentenced to burn on the stake, accused of witchcraft, after a highly unjust trial.Dreyer's film was a huge gamble at the time and he pulled it off astoundingly. It is amazing that the director dared to film much of the the entire first-half in close-ups of Falconetti's face as she stands trial. Falconetti's facial expressions and tragic, yet hopeful eyes beautifully transcend silent cinema. Although the first-half of the film takes place in essentially one room and involves the audience essentially watching the thoughts and reaction of one actor, it is a compelling sequence.The second half of the film focuses on Falconetti's resignation and preparation for her fate. Dreyer burns stark, profound silent images into the viewer's head and leaves them etched in the memory forever as Falconetti's dignity is corroded by her torture, head shaving and eventual burning.Dreyer, in a sense, takes a very minimalist approach to filming THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC (1927) that seems to echo the German Expressionist movement (Dreyer was Danish). He instead chooses to frame the entire film around Falconetti's performance-as bare as the sets may be, her bare-boned performance towers above everything else.It is an outstanding work of cinema and one that all cinema purists should see. However, it is painful to watch at times- not because it is a 110 minute silent film with minimal inter-titles and no extravagance, but because of the painful journey we witness Falconetti go on.

Given my negative experience of other 'great experimental' classics -- \"Napoleon\", \"Metropolis\", \"Greed\" -- I had a suspicion that my own reaction might lie on the former end of the scale: but when the chance to see it presented itself, I felt I ought to take the opportunity. To further my cinematic education, if nothing else.Oddly enough, while it seems to be a film that normally evokes a violent response in one direction or the other, I found myself left floating mildly in the middle. I didn't think it was the greatest film ever made, but I didn't find it unwatchable either.On the most basic level, I can't help feeling that Dreyer picked one of the most unsuitable subjects for a silent film possible: a dramatization of a verbal transcript! I can see the trial of Joan of Arc being presented as an effective radio drama, along the lines of Dorothy L. Sayers' Christ-play, \"The Man Born to be King\", but trying to make a silent movie out of it produces a horribly forced format: the courtroom scenes consist entirely of mouthed dialogue shown on transcribed title cards, followed by incredibly prolonged reaction shots. The (no doubt unintended) impression given was that the reaction shots were only there to break up what would otherwise be an unbroken series of intertitles, rather than being an active artistic choice: certainly Joan must have been an incredibly uncooperative witness if it really took her that long to answer each question. The format just doesn't seem to fit the content: 'talky' silent films are generally a mistake, and this section was nothing *but* talk.And tears. I've never encountered a Joan who cried so much -- I was left wondering if that was why Falconetti was cast, since she seems to have a decided talent for it. The endless weeping didn't actually seem in character for a girl who produces the sort of smart comebacks quoted in the script, and the director seemed to be wallowing in tormenting both star and audience. I was aware of my neighbours fidgeting.But it picks up, unsurprisingly, when it shifts into more natural silent territory and actually allows the characters to move. The sets appear to be cardboard in the most literal sense of the term (the painted-on arrow-slits are particularly obvious), but I couldn't tell if that was a deliberate gesture at modernism or simply the result of budgetary limitations; it gave the whole thing a certain stage play air, but when we actually see the soldiers tormenting Joan rather than watching characters mouth words for the camera, the style becomes more fluid.One technical device I found irritating was the repeated choice to film faces in three-quarter-length, with their foreheads cut off at the eyebrows. This is a mannerism I associate with the misuse of widescreen (which seems to have inherent problems with the fact that humans, unlike landscapes, aren't actually constructed in a letter-box shape), and the 'low-brow' result annoys me just as much coming from 1927 as it does in 2004. But that's just a personal quirk...More audience reaction as we got to the blood-letting: there were audible groans and ughs, and I couldn't help wondering how this was done! Presumably they didn't *really* stick a scalpel into someone's artery, let alone Miss Falconetti's? I noticed that the whole thing was shot in tight close-up with no glimpse of Joan's face.The finale, on the other hand, was more than gruesome enough for anybody, and the contrast to the unmoving opening scenes is stark: Dreyer seems to have gone into Mel-Gibson mode with full gore, writhing flames, etc. Perhaps the only common factor with the courtroom sequence is that it goes on and on: there was certainly no fidgeting at this point, or if there was I myself was too horrified and riveted to be aware of it.But even here there were some consciously arty moments to break the spell: the repeated cut-aways from the bound Joan to free-flying birds were less than subtle, and I can see why the use of the 'pendulum shot' didn't catch on... However, it is certainly convincing, probably too much so to pass for a PG certificate in the modern world: the shots of the charred body slumping into the rising flames are particularly explicit. One is left with the impression of having seen someone burned to death.I don't think I was impressed by the bits that I was probably intended to be impressed by, and I spent a lot of the trial being haunted by echoes of Bernard Shaw's play \"St Joan\", written a few years before this film came out: presumably both authors were quoting from the same sources, although it was distracting to recognise the retorts of Shaw's combative peasant girl while simultaneously presented with a visual of Dreyer's tortured saint. On the other hand, I wasn't nearly as bored as I might have expected to be.

Apparently, there were a lot of similarities to Joan of Arc's last day and of Christ's day. However, here it's the Catholic leaders who are the 'bad guys' while in Jesus' time it was the Pharisees and the Sanhedrin. Also, with Joan's story here, she is portrayed far differently in her ordeal than Christ did, the latter taking everything in stride stoically while Joan, without any physical beating, still cried constantly and signed some paper in a moment of weakness (although she later recants that, which costs the woman her life.)Anyway, about this film:THE GOOD - Wow, what incredible direction and photography. Scene after scene is pretty amazing and especially so when you consider this was made about 80 years ago! I would like to see the same director and photographer doing work with today's technology.The expressions on Maria Falconetti's face throughout the film are memorable. A sadder, more pained look on Joan of Arc - or anyone else's - I have not seen in a motion picture. She also must have set a record that still stands for the most tears shed by one person in a movie! The woman's eyes were like faucets.All of the faces in here - and the film is mostly a series of facial closeups - are amazing and kudos to Criterion for making a DVD that showed these faces with a clear picture and amazing detail. Director Carl Theodor Dreyer's camera angles still look innovative today. He and Orson Welles seem to share the same love of this kind of photography. I found myself numerous times just shaking my head in admiration for how these characters were photographed.Another big plus for this film was the addition of \"The Voices of Light.\" They made the music score in here fantastic. I can't recall too many films in which I have been so impressed with a soundtrack. The DVD gives you the option of watching this film with or without that audio. I strongly recommend viewers to take the audio.Finally, the story itself is memorable, with a powerful ending.THE BAD - I have to make these comments to be fair and honest. It's not hard to understand why many people will find this film almost impossible to sit through, especially those with no emotional or spiritual involvement with the story. That is because it is extremely slow and repetitive. Shot-after-shot of just Falconetti agonizing or crying and weird-looking men staring at her. If you aren't a devotee of cinematography, this movie could be extremely boring after about 10 minutes.As powerful as the story is, it isn't a movie I would recommend for most people. I think most folks - of any age, frankly - would be turned off after 20 minutes. I understand that. As mentioned, this is not an easy film to view. This might be the longest 80-minute movie you'll ever see, if you aren't into it.OVERALL - Visually and audibly: an astounding movie and one I am glad to have finally watched. If I was wishing to get into the movie business and wanted to learn how to shoot films, this would be a film I would study numerous times. Otherwise, one viewing is plenty.

We watched this one last, and it's definitely the best of the three. Those wondering about the title may assume correctly: Mel Gibson took the same approach to Christ in his film Passion of the Christ as this film takes to Joan: The last part of their life leading up to their famous public execution. When one talks about this film, the discussion really has little to do with what happened to Joan herself; it's more about the unique, disorienting way the film is shot, lit, edited, and acted. The director isn't really interested in teaching the audience about Joan; her trial is just the setting for this little head trip. The whole thing is very disorienting; in the courtroom scene, you're not allowed a sense of where each character is sitting or how the room is laid out.

His simple but mesmerizing technique is to place the actors in rooms with stark white walls, film them in extreme close-up, and assemble the film by alternating images of Joan with those of her interrogators. The bare white set contrasts with the actors' faces, which are filmed in such detail that their flesh almost becomes tangible, and reveals everything you need to know. The craggy, warty faces of Joan's interrogators suggest human menace and evil, without the actors ever assuming an overtly menacing expression.Renee Maria Falconetti, playing Joan, is required to go through the entire film with the camera focused tightly on her bare face as it registers all the infinite nuances of anguished but steadfast faith. Tears often roll down her cheeks, yet she never forces them out of her by sobbing, or tries to hold them back by closing her eyes. The openness of her face, the involuntary flow of her tears, help establish Joan's saintliness: it feels as though she suffers and weeps not for herself, but for the whole world. The moment when Joan, alone in her cell, realizes that she must become a martyr, is an extraordinary piece of acting.Famous theater director and theorist Antonin Artaud appears here as a young, compassionate monk. At first I thought it ironic that the founder of the \"Theater of Cruelty\" should play one of the least cruel characters in the movie; however, after doing a little research on Artaud, I noticed similarities between his theories and this film. Artaud wanted theater to be an intense, cathartic, spiritual experience, relying on emotion and gesture rather than text, using physical means to achieve a metaphysical purpose.

A second negative, re-edited by Dreyer from alternate takes was also thought lost to a fire. Then in 1981, after more than half a century, an original danish copy was discovered in a Norwegian mental institution, allowing us to view the film probably very close to its original form.Dreyer was a master of portraying human emotion, and this film shows his artistry at the peak of his form, elevating him to the great pantheon of auteur's. In a very unorthodox technique, Dreyer refused to cast actors for the roles in this film, and refused to let anyone wear make-up, jewellery or facial enhancing products of any kind. He wanted to show humans in their simplest form, stripping them of all made up beauty, revealing our primitive emotions with true transparency, in order to display the delicate subtleties of our features and emotions. The relentless close ups in the film allow us to observe every flutter, every quivering lip and tear rolling down the cheek, displaying the aesthetic beauty of the human expression, using our faces as a window on our soul. Some silent films can be hard to watch, however like Murnau's masterpiece Sunrise (1927), these detailed human displays of feeling and suffering transcend any message that could possibly be spoken or written, and reveal endless levels of character interpretation.Although this film goes into a lot of detail on Joan's devotion to Christianity, I don't think that it would take away from the experience for someone without strong beliefs. I am not a particularly religious person, however this film touched me in a way that only few films can. I found the realisation of Joans suffering and emotional torment almost unbearable at times, however the film, although deeply sad, left me feeling so very blessed.

The mesmerizing performance of Maria (Ren\u00e9e) Falconetti, filmed primarily as a series of brutalizing close-ups, is still the main reason to revisit Carl Theodor Dreyer's austere and claustrophobic 1928 silent film classic about the trial and execution of Joan of Arc. There is little provided in the way of background or context, as Dreyer made an intentional decision to use the original trial records as the basis of his dialogue. Using a minimum of sets, almost abstract in orientation, he uses the camera frame as his canvas by showing the bullying interrogation of Joan by her inquisitors in a series of face shots against a white backdrop. The actors had to use their make-up-free faces as their sole means of expression. There are never any establishing shots, so the viewer never knows where the characters are in relationship to each other. Instead, Dreyer uses dramatic camera angles to convey people's position in the story. As the film builds to its climax, graphic footage of Joan being burned at the stake alternates with sequences of angry French peasants being brutally driven out of Rouen Castle by club-wielding English soldiers. Many of the shots feel abstract and out of proportion to convey a world turned upside down.The overall effect of these creative and daring techniques gives the film a more contemporary feeling than a standard silent, and luckily, adding to the freshness of the treatment is a pristine print found in Copenhagen, the basis of the transfer in this Criterion Collection DVD. An effectively stirring enhancement is Richard Einhorn's beautiful \"Voices of Light\", an oratorio specifically written to accompany the film decades after its release. Falconetti was 35 when she played the 19-year old peasant girl, but she is entirely convincing using her large eyes and facial plains to build her character's spirit as it dwindles under the pressure of the French clergymen who rule her fate. One truly believes her assertion that she is a messenger for God. Never to act on screen again, she gives a truly legendary performance deserving of the hosannas received over the years. The DVD contains an interesting commentary track on which Dreyer scholar Casper Tybjerg provides a wealth of information. It also contains features on the film's unusually stylized production design, Einhorn's music, and the checkered history of the many versions that \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" has gone through over the years.

Very short hair, fine features in spite of her social condition of uncultured peasant, deep and large eyes burning of the same unquenchable fire bound to put an end to her life: this is our heroine, whose beauty is emphasized at once by her great faith in the infinite mercy of God.She never staggers under the heavy burden of her charge in the presence of her inquisitors, unreal and monstrous entities whose hardheartedness shows up on their grotesque features and on their unnatural animal-like attitude, judging by their perverse faces distorted by extremely short focal length lenses. They look like personified devilish entities engaged in a cat-and-mouse game, their ugliness accentuated by a series of uncommon close-ups contrasting with Joan's wonderful face that shows the extreme dramaticity of her situation instead, compelled to endure her pain with great courage and to bear the heavy weight of her cross with resignation, without losing her steady disposition of soul, wanting to go through with her rigidity of principles at the cost of her life.Satanic grimaces, devilish sneers, derisive laughters and spittle emphasize the ineluctable course of this absurd justice system while the vision of her holocaust hovers above the head of the sacrifical victim, so fragile, so vulnerable when fighting in defense of her behavior, so unheard when holding her own opinion, so unprotected when pleading her cause. She objects strenuously to everything they say because faith leads people to do things they never would have imagined themselves capable of, but her passionate words flow away like feeble whispers in a windy day, while her enchanting eyes scan an invisible sky, looking for something beyond her human strength, beyond every possibilities of the common mortals, maybe a divine sign from above, even if there's no question about her unshakable devotion to God, because \"God knows where He bring us\", she thinks, \"but we are able to know the road to Him only when we reach the end of it.\" Every sequences are included in the above described oppressive scenario whose hypnotic suggestion expressionist style reminds us of the universal sense of pain ready to penetrate deeply into the substrate of our Christian and human consciences, in the inmost recesses of the soul, sharing our hidden emotions awakened by the vision of a defenseless face appealing for mercy in vain, without never losing her dignity.Joan, of Arc, splendidly played by Ren\u00e9e Falconetti in this \"PASSION\", might be considered the symbol of the eternal suffering of human beings, adorned with an aureole of beauty and holiness, set on a supreme pedestal, higher and higher than every other female characters of the history of cinema, namely the ideal heroin per antonomasia especially thanks to the heart-rending final purification, moving and endless journey around the deep black of human soul, around the meanders of a faith itinerary stranded for ages on the sand-banks of a devastating fanatic pragmatism.

When one sees films like VERTIGO which barely registered with movie-going audiences at the time of their release but after restoration went on to become one of the best films of the last century, it only shows that film, as an art, doesn't need a golden statuette to have merit, and when it's done exceptionally well, it can be seen in any context and any time period beyond its release date and will still hold its audience in awe.Carl Theodore Dryer, to me, created what I believe is, alongside Orson Welles' CITIZEN KANE, the most powerful black and white film in cinema history. It would be difficult indeed to say which one is better since both films are landmark in their own cinematic styles and have been dissected frame by frame. Dryer's film has been criticized for either being a pretty collection of still images or being pure visual power: I choose the latter, because in watching THE PASSION OF JOAN OF ARC, I felt not only the extremely uncomfortable intimacy between Joan and her tormentors, but her sublime emotions as they pass through her face as she is mocked, cross-examined, humiliated, and burned at the cross. There is an unearthly beauty in Falconetti's face as she goes through the ringer of emotions not in the overacting style typical of the Twenties but in a completely modern way, as if she were living a reality so far removed from the corrupted priests who bash and condemn her, and her reality would therefore be dangerous to their own beliefs.And what a stroke of genius, I think, to have the lighting on her face be soft, gentle, in contrast to her detractors who are always lit in harsh light which exacerbates their ugliness and betrays their \"devotion\" to God as mere politics. Dryer's style of cutting from one actor to the other is also different, and makes this film a surrealist experience, an unsettling, abstract tour through transcendental suffering. There are no defining shots which tell us where exactly is the story taking place (although we don't need to know after reading the transcripts), but we never are allowed as viewers a moment of rest from this suffocating intimacy between Joan and her inquisitors. Some bizarre shots and camera angles give the ending an even more disturbing and horrifying element of what we perceive as a gross injustice to what was a person who held her own beliefs and did not need the Church to sustain it.Falconetti never did a film before this one and never returned to film acting after this. I have not read much about her, except that she lived in Argentina until her death in 1946. I sometimes wonder why she didn't act again (although she was known to be an accomplished theatre actress more known for comedies than drama) but those are the mysteries of actors who don't have the star ego and only make a few films. She came, only did this masterful performance, and left just as suddenly, and those who re-discovered this film and restored it to its full quality have to be commended for allowing us, who have come almost 80 years later, to experience the power of subtle acting.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 83, "votes": 96}, "heading": "When Film Becomes Transcendental Art.", "date": "2005-08-02T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw1141277", "sentiment score": [0.051, 0.1627, 0.2259, 0.3807, 0.1797]}, {"content": "This has got to be the finest film that ever made.

Unlike most silent films, it is wonderfully modern in its use of close ups of Falconetti. Beyond these remarkable closeups, Dreyer has a great visual sense, most notably in two pivotal scenes: the torture chamber, which gets your heart pumping, and the climax/finale, where you feel for Joan and then it rouses you (like the crowd) to anger. The film's sets are spare and white, not unlike a sanitarium, which gives you a sense of the trapped sensation that Joan must have felt in her last days on earth.Buoying this work of art is Richard Einhorn's score, \"Voices of Light,\" which although not the original musical accompaniment to the film, it was inspired by the film.

There's not a hint of sentimentality, and still I was in tears. Yep. Call me a pansy, but this is one of the very few movies that had that impact on me.I don't know what else to say about this movie, sorry. The Passion of Joan of Arc counts as the most upsetting movie experience I've ever had, but it's definitely a positive one. On the contrary to what the other commentators have said, you don't have to be religious to be receptive in front of this movie. Believe me, I'm a hardcore atheist. If you're going to see this film -- I sure hope you do -- make sure it's accompanied with the Voices of Light soundtrack, which doesn't just fit the film well, but is amazing as a standalone composition, too.

Dreyer's The Passion of Joan of Arc was made, perhaps, years ahead of its time- my guess would be that if it wasn't burned after its initial release, it would've had as stunning an impact on the film world years down the line as Citizen Kane did. Though the use of close-ups and distorted angles were not completely new in this film, it felt like Dreyer was creating a new kind of cinema, one where reality, however cold and pitiful, was displayed with complete sincerity. There is also the editing (by Dreyer and Marguerite Beague), which has the timing that many directors/editors of the modern day could only hope to achieve (it has the influence of Eisenstein, only in a totally different historical context), and those moves with the camera by Rudolph Mate (who would go on to photograph Foreign Correspondent and Lady from Shanghai) that are precious- to call his work on the film extraordinary is an understatement.And it was crucial for Dreyer to use the close-ups and tilted angles and shots where you only see the eyes in the bottom of the frame, and so forth- he's developing the perfect atmosphere in regards to a trial set in 15th century France. It's all those eyes, all those faces, holding all those stolid mindsets that send Joan to her fate. Pretty soon a viewer feels these presences from all these people, so strong and uncompromising, and Dreyer does a miraculous thing- he makes it so that we forget about the time and place, and all of our attention is thrown onto those eyes of Joan, loaded to brim with a sorrow for where she is, but an un-questionable faith in what she feels about God. I wondered at one point whether Dreyer was making as much a point on people's faiths and prejudices in the almighty, or just one on basic humanity.There have been many before me who have praised Falconetti's performance to the heavens (Kael called it the finest performance in film), but in a way it almost can't be praised enough. What she achieves here is what Ebert must've felt watching Theron in the recent 'Monster'. I didn't even see her in a performance as Joan of Arc- I saw her as being the embodiment of it, as if Falconetti (with Dreyer's guidance) took Joan out of the pages of the trial transcript and her entire soul took over. There is something in an actor that has to be so compelling, so startling, and indeed so recognizable, that a person can feel empathy and/or sympathy for the person the actor's playing. All a viewer has to do is stare into Falconetti's eyes in any shot, close-up or not, and that viewer may get stirred to boiled-down emotion. For me, it was almost TOO over-whelming an emotional experience- when Joan is about to get tortured, for example, I found myself completely lost from where I was watching the film, everything in my soul and being was with Joan in that chamber, and for a minute I broke out in tears. That's the kind of effect that Dreyer's craft and all the acting work (including Eugene Sylvain as the Bishop Cauchon, and of course Artaud as Jean) can have on a viewer. I'm not saying it has to, yet The Passion of Joan of Arc could- and should- be considered a milestone in cinematic tragedy, where the images that come streaming forth never leave a viewer, and the detail for time and place becomes just that, a detail for the main stage.

He forces us to look at Joan's face in a hundred fragmented close-ups, gaze into her steely eyes permeated with God's destiny, never sure of our surroundings. He makes us those that would judge her, gawking at her facetiously. She's the greatest angel we've ever had, and Dreyer doesn't make the mistake of turning her into a device for sympathy: when she bends, it's not because she's weak, it's because she's overcome with God's power. As usual with Dreyer, his film is something that we reflect ourselves onto: are we Joan, or the onlookers? When Joan cries, do we blame ourselves?Individual scenes are captivating: the scene where Joan is tortured in order to confess to lying is one of the tensest in film, and when she gets her hair chopped off it's as if her soul is being hacked away. Dreyer never shows her as a warrior in battle; indeed, he just shows the chaos incited by her death. In terms of silent movie impressiveness, there's a cool scene with blood squirting out when Joan is bled due to her fever, and some jarring cuts to a mother milking her baby. There is a great sense of drama here, as well. The questioning of Joan is often brilliant: How do they know she wasn't hearing the voice of the Devil? She certainly looks possessed. All Joan can say is, \"To make me suffer the Devil has sent you.\" Falconetti is magnetic, otherworldly, drained. You can see why she never acted again. Like all true artists, she lets us peer into her soul, and it's frightening. Dreyer uses her magnificently -- through each tear droplet, her soul pushes its way out of her physical body so we can see inside.I personally don't believe she was the daughter of God, or a clairvoyant; instead, I respect that she didn't question herself, only those around her. It's what makes her human: God told her what to do, and since you can't question God, she's not liable. It's that maddening sense of childishness and purity and stubbornness and hypocrisy and a million other things that makes her someone you can't understand, makes her human. It's not so much that we believe she's hearing God as it is we believe that she believes she is. That kind of assurance is, of course, wildly admirable, but at the same time offensive and incredibly dangerous. Worshipping at the altar of Joan is foolish, I think, except for what it represents: trial by fire, and mankind's cynical, relentless attitude, comprised mainly of jaded non-believers. Dreyer's film is great not because it presents Joan as the greatest of martyrs but because it has the courage to show her as simple and human -- and probably as loony as the rest of us. 10/10", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 6, "votes": 10}, "heading": "10/10", "date": "2004-01-09T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0005469", "sentiment score": [0.0195, 0.0282, 0.056, 0.3461, 0.5503]}, {"content": "There is really nothing I can say about this movie other than to tell you to get a hold of a copy as soon as you can, and keep a few boxes of tissues nearby.

Let me explain. The pure, raw emotions expressed by Maria Falconetti as Joan burst off the screen. Her performance was the highlight of the film for me. I never would have expected to see so many different shades of terror, loss, sadness, etc. expressed so expertly. She just drew me in. The film style of Carl Dreyer also makes this picture stand out among others of the time and even now. Notice how we never see a wide establishing shot. Instead, Dreyer aggressively chose to shoot the whole thing with medium shots to extreme close-ups. This technique, combined with a fair amount of camera subjectivity creates for the viewer a sense of intimacy with Joan. At least it did for me. I couldn't help but sympathize with her if not theologically, then purely visually. It is a terrifying thing to face death, but it is also an interesting twist for this story that Joan knows no matter what anyone says, that she is on the right side. To be able to convey such inner turmoil in a character is a fantastic achievement. Furthermore, the director shot her so well, that her performance needed to be as excellent as it was. The viewer was going to get close to Joan and feel her pain. That was a directorial decision, it was up to Joan to draw us closer. Also of note is the blatant reference to the `Odessa Steps' scene in Eisenstein's Potemkin (1925). Dreyer's use of montage is appropriate and skillfully done. However, I was a bit disappointed to see a repetition of what such a popular director had just done. Overall, this film seems to me to be a great example of film as art. Though visually stunning, the film's only downfall is that it may have been too long. I feel the story could have been portrayed just as well in say, 30 minutes.

It's something of a truism now that this is one of the best-acted, most emotive films ever created, and I couldn't agree more, which is why using this film to begin thinking about the myriad issues in film studies seems ideal.On the most basic level, there is a wealth of topics related to symbolism and semiotics (silent films \"speak\" entirely in visual signs). There is also, as many others have pointed out, a use of camera angle and shot framing that is emotionally and narratively powerful, but also seems stylized to contemporary viewers, thereby simultaneously drawing viewers in and allowing a critical distance for examination of the technique.The addition of Einhorn's score makes this film a wonderful case study in theories of textuality, textual authority and discourse theory. The various theories of authorship (Foucault's \"what is an author?\" and Barthes' \"Work/Text\" seem particularly applicable) can be studied at length considering that Dryer is not around to consult about the addition. Einhorn's libretto also raises a number of questions about the relationship between Dryer's film, the other stories of Joan of Arc (explored on the Criterion DVD), Biblical text and the female mystics. Biblical exegesis, textual criticism, semiotics and psychoanalytic theory can all be brought together to elucidate some of the most urgent questions any text can ask: what is the nature of humanity? What is the human relation to (a)god? What are the political/religious/ethical ways gender is dealt with? (or performed?) What is jurisprudence?Usually, I would try to separate each of these inquires into film, if for no other reason than I know of few texts are both intellectually AND emotionally complex enough to support such a thorough inquiry without boring students.

This is a gem that needs to be seen by real film buffs (who would opt to view the film without sound, as director Carl Theodor Dreyer preferred) and current directors and producers. When I first began viewing it, I thought it had been filmed very recently. All the techniques used, from the placement of lights and cameras to the intimate close-ups of the faces of actors are stunning, almost shocking. As a still photographer, I feel the camera work by Rudolph Mate is tremendous -- there were angles used during the filming of the 1928 movie that still aren't used today.

Mat\u00e9's compositions must have been kept off-center to give the viewer a sense of imbalance.

The experience is so realistic and overpowering that by the time the fire is lit under her stake, you can practically smell the burning wood.Almost the whole film is a carefully filmed and edited sequence of close-up shots that emphasize every aspect of Joan's plight, and that enable us to share in the deepest of her feelings. The masterful shot selection takes full advantage of Falconetti's unparalleled performance as she shows us who Joan was. By keeping everything in close, we never take our attention off of what Joan is enduring, and the intensity of the experience is never allowed to dissipate.After following Joan's lengthy trial and interrogation, the film climaxes with a phenomenal look at her execution. It cycles through shots of Joan, the stake, her tormentors, and the crowd, and occasionally a shot of birds flying gracefully overhead, overwhelming us with moving sensations.To be sure, this is not the kind of film that casual audiences would necessarily enjoy. What Joan of Arc endured was an unspeakable combination of systematic humiliation and physical agony, and Dreyer's film makes us feel every bit of it.

The Danish director champions individualism using the persecution of Joan (Ren\u00e9e Falconetti) as a vehicle. This is achieved with the uncompromising use of close-ups, low angle shots, quick cuts and the strong influence of the art movements of the early 20th century.The trial and execution of Joan of Arc is condensed into a single afternoon. This revision serves Dreyer's primary theme of the struggle for autonomy between the individual and society. Joan represents a threat to the status quo and Dreyer plays on this binary opposition. Joan's direct communication with God undermines the rule of the Catholic Church. Traditional gender roles are questioned by Joan's refusal to take off her masculine clothing, thereby refusing to relinquish power to the patriarchal society. Her resistance to signing the written confession brings the church's hypocrisy to surface. The church's mandate is not to prove Joan a heretic, but to stop the spread of her insubordination.To convey Joan's isolation, Dreyer employs a never-ending barrage of extreme close-ups. This unconventional technique serves to heighten the effect of individualism in Dreyer's rendition of Joan. This overuse of the close-up would inevitably falter, were it not for the remarkable performance of Ren\u00e9e Falconetti.Joan's captors are filmed at sharp low-angles, ensuring an unquestionable level of authority. These low angles become increasingly oblique as the tension mounts towards Joan's execution. The result of this extremity is disorienting, creating spatial confusion and uncomfortable monotony for the viewer.Dreyer is unrelenting in his use of fast cuts throughout the film. Touching on elements of French Impressionism and Soviet cinema, these cuts dart between Joan's exasperated close-ups and the austere low-angle shots of the French judges and English guards. The influence of German Expressionism can be noted within the stylized mise en sc\u00e8ne. Joan is often disproportionately framed with the crucifix, displayed in the form of barred windows and their resulting shadows.By employing these tactics, Dreyer successfully brings to light the humanity of Joan of Arc. Conversely, her persecutors are convincingly depicted for their insurmountable position of power. The result is an artistically realized silent film that has earned a deserved place in the history of French cinema.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 5, "votes": 8}, "heading": "A seminal landmark for the artistic stylization of French film", "date": "2000-12-29T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0005431", "sentiment score": [0.057, 0.1409, 0.1864, 0.4164, 0.1994]}, {"content": "While viewing this film on video, I wondered, where are the battles, where is the King, etc.?

Worst of all, Dreyer assumes we will automatically sympathize with Joan of Arc, so he does little to help us in that respect. Some may argue that scenes with cruel guards/priests are enough. However, this argument fails since Dreyer never convinces us that Joan is truthful. In fact, he accidentally gives the opposite impression, with numerous shots of her so wide-eyed she looks like she's about to pick up an axe and chop up the judges.2. None of the film's four most powerful scenes belong to Joan. They instead belong to a torture device and various people who sympathize with Joan.3. The music is too good. Normally, great music isn't a problem, but since there is so little quality on screen, \"Passion\"'s music completely overshadows the rest of the film.

I regard it very highly because the film is able to combine influences from different countries (e.g., the set design is part German Expressionism, achieved by one of the set designers, German-born Hermann Warm), communicates both Joan's disoriented state of mind and her spirituality (sometimes at the same time) and accomplishes both of these achievements by the film's third asset: the cinematography, largely done by Frenchman Rudolph Mate. Not even in a film by Sergio Leone (Once Upon A Time In The West, for example) was the camera used so adventurously with regard to its use of the close-up. Dreyer is gutsy enough to violate certain film norms to convey a feeling of disorientation and yet intimacy, so that we closer identify with Joan's state of mind--that of intense devoutness and despair.Dreyer has some shots canted (tilted) very severely, so that we're occasionally looking STRAIGHT UP at someone who looks down at us (such as Andre Berley's Jean D'Estivet, when he criticizes Joan). Close-ups of people we've never seen before suddenly pop up, and we start to think: \"Who was that?\". We lose our sense of what cinema calls spatial continuity, or a consistency in how objects are spaced from one another. Because he uses so many close-ups, we cannot tell where one priest is from another, or where Joan is in relation to a priest who questions her. We, like Joan, become confused at being interrogated (often the priests' questions are directed at US, as they look straight at the camera) from all sides. The close-ups also emphasize contrasts in physical features (Dreyer made, as I understand it, his actors and actresses wear no make-up in the film), so that we see the ugliness of certain priests (particularly head interrogator Bishop Cauchon, played by Eugene Silvain) and the physical and spiritual beauty of Joan.It is because of the rule-breaking cinematography, along with the superb acting--no one overplays their role as silent film actors often tend to do--that the film retains its' marvelous power. Seventy-two years after the film appeared, it is still mentioned in reviews about a film where Joan of Arc is the subject (Luc Besson's \"The Messenger\" is the latest example), which attests to the film's strength. Because of these virtues, I regard \"The Passion of Joan of Arc\" very highly, and I strongly recommend that any filmgoer see it at least once, to experience a film that, like Joan, possesses a spirit that is timeless.", "rating": 10, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 3, "votes": 4}, "heading": "A Film That, Like Joan, Is Rebellious Yet Has a Soul", "date": "2000-04-03T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0005419", "sentiment score": [0.0379, 0.0974, 0.1452, 0.3514, 0.368]}, {"content": "I watched the Video Images 1985 video cassette version.

On the one hand the facial close ups were pretty, but they got tedious for me, and I do feel that I have a lot of patience with movies.\tI feel that this movie could have benefitted a great deal from sound. Mainly because in a court room interrogation sound would be useful. Given that the actors in the film would also have made as good voice actors as they are actors, this could have been very captivating. As it is I found the most interesting scene to be the torture wheel. The slower film speed makes it appear abstracted and dreamlike. The interrogations still have their intense bits, and I feel that the supporting actors contributed very well to the feel of the movie.\tThe main long term artistic merit of the film is the artistic cropping of the close ups of Joan. The same close ups and cropping were used on Sigourney Weaver in Alien 3. There is even a head shaving scene in both movies. Alien 3 seems to be praised mainly for mood and cinematography by other imdb reviewers. It borrows these from Joan of Arc. This shows that these devices are still relevant today, which means that Passions of Joan of Arc has framing and set up that are considered good by a general audience today. This also shows that facial close ups of a woman with a shaved head just do not necessarily make a good movie without substance to back the film up.\tWhat back up there is in Joan is excellent. The story is based on reality which gives it distinctive twists, so plotwise the film is stable. The actors who make up the court trying Joan are excellent. They make the film worth watching.\tMy final recommendation is to skip this, unless you like artsy close ups, or have some special reason for viewing it. It was slow for me at bits, and I doubt that you be captivated by the whole film. The excellent acting keeps the movie from being to tedious, but it didn\u00d5t pull me in.

Who would follow a person like that? Christ after his betrayal kept a commanding presence. It was almost as if Dreyer looked at all the martyr sculptures, created a consummate victim for his film play, and forgot about the real person who caused the controversy in the first place. Falconetti's Joan would fit in well with the Children's Crusade, but was no Deborah or Boudicca leading troops, or even the Joan who passed muster with the King's counselors before being sent off to battle.The \"Voices of Light\" soundtrack and the composition as a whole worked beautifully together on the DVD as a fascinating work of art.

I think that's where the true power of this film lies; in the fact that it concentrates on the exploration of universal human emotions and themes in a simple story, rather then having it's power and timelessness detracted from by an overly complex plot and other timely constructions.Since this is one of my first reviews here, the first two being Tarkovsky's Sacrifice and Nostalgia, I'll arrange my thoughts as much as possible to not make this overlong and gushing. Just want to comment on certain aspects of this film which particularly struck me. First of all, was the sense that this was one unified work of art, every element of film working together seamlessly, to form a coherent picture with a unique clarity of spirit, which feels very unencumbered by excess. The sublime orchestration of music and images overwhelmed me with its poignancy; it was like music for all of the senses, always keeping everything at a high plane of emotion, accentuating the transcendent feeling I had throughout.Falconetti as Joan, as I've heard many times before, is the best performance ever captured on film, hands down. Even before there was \"method\" acting, she embodied it. You could feel every emotion she felt, because you sensed she was never holding anything back. With the whole movie done in closeups, the indescribably expressive quality of her face only intensifies, making her's and your involvement much more personal.It is not only Falconetti's relentless portrait of suffering that comes through to the viewer, but most powerfully, the spiritual glory and triumph which shines through her luminous eyes in the midst of the worst suffering, which shows her pure spirit and the strength of her faith. That is what most stayed with me about this film, even after the horrifying closing moments of her burning body on the stake. It was her triumph.", "rating": 0, "helpfulness": {"votedAsHelpful": 5, "votes": 7}, "heading": "The Most Spiritually Overwhelming Film Ever Made", "date": "1999-01-26T00:00:00.000Z", "url": "https://www.imdb.com/review/rw0005422", "sentiment score": [0.1246, 0.1997, 0.0933, 0.1964, 0.386]}, {"content": "Dreyer's masterpiece is also Falconetti's masterpiece and the most powerful film role by any woman ever.
