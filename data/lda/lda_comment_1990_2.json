Like \"Primal Fear\", \" The Sixth Sense\" features credible performances by two Hollywood icons whose work at times have made me want to vomit, but these films were dominated not by their star leading men but by their relatively unknown co -stars.

It was great; most of all for three really important reasons. First of all the ending twist is the best and most thought provoking twist in a horror film since Norman Bates was Mrs. Bates in \"Psycho\"!!! Because a film can not be judged on the ending alone, there are two other reasons why this film is the best horror film made in the 90's. It's dramatic and caring. I really cared for these characters even though it was total fiction; that's what really good films do best. And I also enjoyed the terror and scary images in the film; they were very HAUNTING! This is a great motion picture. Only complaint; the Bruce Willis character leaves the boy too soon I think, I mean we are dealing with ghosts here; you would of thought he would of stayed with the boy longer. Also the film is never truly climatic or absolutely enthralling. But, all in all this stands as one of the best films of the year; it's on my top ten list!

Was this such a great movie, that both critics and audiences loved it so? With huge anticipation I finally got to see the film in October and although I expected something great, I didn't expect it like that!! The scripting, the plot, the directing, the acting ... is one of the best I've ever seen. I've always been fond of Bruce Willis films, the action and suspension. But this is by far his best film, his best acting, and most profitable! The star of the movie is Harvey Joel Osment, a true wonderkid, and if there ever was a justice in awards for acting, this kid should get some trophies. The script should be nominated too, plus Olivia Williams and Toni Collette. All are doing a great job and when you think about this film after you've seen... you get more and more convinced. This is arguably the best movie I've seen (besides Titanic) and I want to thank everyone involved in it for that. A true masterpiece. A true gem. A film you won't forget.

It is the only film of this year that deserved to make a lot of money (The Matrix and The Phantom Menace disappointed me terribly). It is unlike the rest of the movies Hollywood throws out. Unlike the empty Matrix and the Phantom Menace, the Sixth Sense is a character driven drama. It comes to a conclusion that no other ghost movie (that I've ever seen) has touched on. I think the film has a good chance to snatch up some Oscar noms. I think it deserves nods for script and definitely Best Supporting Actor in Osment (though he really is the main character, he is pushed to second string because of the bigger star). I wouldn't even be offended if Willis got a nom, seeing that this is his best film besides maybe 12 Monkeys and Pulp Fiction. Now for the ending that I mentioned in my summary. Most people will know about it this late in the game, but I won't tell. I think it pulls attention away from the true greatness of the film, which is the characters. It is what we were talking about after we left the theater, and I'm disappointed at myself for doing so. Sure it was neat, but I have gone through it in my mind several times, finding flaws within the film. Surprise endings are almost always detractors. If you remember a film just because of its surprise ending, it is a worthless film, just like The Usual Suspects, a very bad film if anyone would actually think about something besides the ending. overall 8/10, being a 9 originally, but losing 1 point for its supposed hook."}, {"rank": 143, "name": "The Sixth Sense", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "The Sixth Sense is without doubt the most intelligent and cleverly scripted movie of 1999.

Collette is very good and a scene towards the end is beautifully played by her and the kid who is also great.

The reasons are too numerous to go into in such a short critique. Surely there have not been too many films that can take you through the range of emotions that the Sixth Sense does. The prime emotion; fear, is a difficult emotion to generate in a modern audience that has seen it all before, but this film succeeds where others fail, praying on your imagination and generating suspense from subtle devices rather than blatant horror.It is such a relief that the performances of Willis and the excellent Osment live up to an excellently directed quality storyline. I will be disappointed if the youngster doesn't receive at least an academy nomination.I seldom go to the cinema twice to watch a film, in fact I cannot remember when I have done it before. Tonight I am taking an old friend to see this film as it will be a tragedy if he doesn't see it on the big screen. He has heard so much about it that he is reluctant to go, as I am when something is over-hyped. Just for a change though, here is a film that lives up to its billing and has you thinking about it for weeks to come. As for the twist at the end?

The Sixth Sense is one of those extraordinary movies that does that to me. This movie reflects on some difficult subjects that will make the viewer walk away asking eternal questions. Questions about death, about letting go, about eternal love and commitment, about the love between parent and child, and between husband and wife.

There seems though a marked difference in the promise of young Haley-Joel Osment who almost carries the brilliant 'Sixth Sense' on his own shoulders as the apparently mentally troubled Cole Sear. Osment seems to almost inspire the likes of Bruce Willis to separately stellar performances. Cole Sear claims to have the ability to 'see dead people', Willis is the child psychologist who helps Cole deal with his strange 'hallucinations'.Willis' character, Malcolm Crowe is determined not to fail Cole in the way he failed an almost identical case years before. Crowe eventually discovers the incredible truth behind young Coles claims in one of the films more chilling scenes involving a tape recording of a previous session with another 'psychic'. Another scene which seemed to highlight the films Oscar potential involved Cole and his mother (played well by Toni Collette) caught in a traffic jam resulting from an accident, it is in this scene that the film reached its emotional peak and seems to reach out to anyone who has lost someone close to them without warning and with so much left unfinished.The Sixth Sense is an emotional and truly hair raising, fine piece of work that contains a final twist that will drop your jaw and send you back for more.

Well, there's one of many moments in this (there's so many that just made every hair on my body stand on end, my skin crawl, and made me actually gasp- and I can say that movies that only have 1 or 2 moments like that, I can probably only name 10 or so) I won't give the end away, but the moment that starts out with the kid appearing to Cole and whispering excitedly, \"Come on, I'll show you where my Dad keeps his gun\"- that one moment, to me, was 10 times scarier than all of BWP put together. There were many times where I jumped, and it wasn't just a \"fake\" jump, it was something clever that I genuinely didn't see coming. As far as The Twist, first of all, I've decided when it's hyped that a movie HAS a twist ending, that's a drag right there, because you-well, I do anyway--spend at least half the time trying to guess the twist. Having seen a hell of a lot of movies, and a hell of a lot of twists, I usually get it 9 times out of 10. (BEGIN MINOR SPOILER) I guessed the twist in Jacob's Ladder, so...and it was already spoiled because I read a review that DIDN\"T give a warning, but said, \"If you've seen Jacob's Ladder and Angelheart, you'll see this one coming a mile away\"(END) I'm pretty much the spoiler queen, it's like heroin or something, maybe 1% of the time I can resist reading them, I don't know what it is. If I had to pick any movie where I could go back and not know the spoiler ahead of time, this would be it. My husband didn't see it coming, and he's pretty clever about guessing them too. Something else I did not see coming was how emotional this movie made me. I had a friend die on me without getting to say goodbye but was over my grieving, and if you've recently experienced the death of someone close to you (especially if you are not finished grieving) then in all seriousness, please think twice before you watch it. During the second to last scene in the car, I surprised myself by starting to cry, hard, and I didn't stop until the credits were partway over (and Bruce Willis is not one of my favorite actors). GOD that scene in the car got to me. Re-reading the screenplay, I realized even more how great it was, and how heartbreaking. There are so many elements that just make your heart wrench. I read the last scenes of the screenplay at home, alone, and had a really good cry, which hasn't happened since I read the screenplay to The Green Mile. Aside from that, again, this movie scared the crap out of me. The premise is very scary but they could have handled it in a way that bungled it up, but they did it just right. Even if you *really* don't like Bruce Willis' acting, and were turned off by the trailer, give it a chance.

There are some genuinely scary moments, (I jumped watching this and didn't jump once during the dismal \"Stigmata\"). Its pretty much like Maltin says, \"the film is sinuous and creepy without being manipulative.\" Haley Joel Osment is astonishing, never has a child actor been so convincing since Anna Paquin in The Piano, who was around the same age when she won her academy award. Osment makes the film seem all the more real. I haven't seen Bruce Willis this good since Pulp Fiction. Toni Collete is great too, (although i could hear her australian accent creep through on occasion). Unfortunately, I was already aware of the twist at the end, (thanks to a tv presenter who decided to be incredibly irritating to my country by broadcasting the twist just to annoy everybody!) but this didnt diminish the power of the final scenes, which were both creepy, and touching. Ive already heard from people that this movie \"sux\" and it \"doesnt have enough blood\" and \"it was boring\", oh and \"End of Days looks better\". Hmmmmmmmmm, im sure a Schwarzenegger action vehicle will be better. Right.

I don't know whether this says something about me or the predictability of Hollywood but from simply having some knowledge of what the film was about, I actually guessed what the twist would be before I had even seen the film. Given this hunch, it was really quite obvious as the film progressed that I was right -however even when it came at the end it was still packed with enough power that it sent a shiver through my body.Credit then to the director, who accomplishes this, and the rest of the film with consumate skill. There are a few powerful moments in this film which should rightly go down as great moments in cinema. However if I was going to draw faults, I would say it takes too long for the plot which everybody already knows (that the kid can see dead people) to unfold, and that perhaps more could have been done with it one it has.Still, great performances from both Bruce Willis and Haley Joel Osment as the kid make this as believable as it could possibly be, and you're unlikely to see a better chiller than this in the next year.Go see it."}, {"rank": 143, "name": "The Sixth Sense", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Hollywood's been getting better at producing more intelligent horror/thriller films of late. I'm not sure what's going on; perhaps it's something they're putting in the bottled water. Anyway - \"The Sixth Sense\" is a lovely example of what a \"taught psychological thriller\" should be all about. Shyamalan's opus about a little boy and his counsellor hits exactly all the right buttons, and does so whilst cranking up the tension to an almost unbearable level.It is not overly gory, it does not rely on hugely fantastic special effects to stun and amaze the audience, neither does it resort to clich\u00e9d shock tactics. It is a great example of a good idea for a good film cleverly executed. The performances are good by all, but a special mention must go to Haley Joel Osment who plays a difficult and demanding role with the ability and talent of an actor five times his age. Toni Collette is also superb as his troubled mother, and it is very refreshing to see her tackling such a diverse range of roles (including such films as \"Muriel's Wedding\", \"Emma\" and \"Velvet Goldmine\").I will confess that the storyline was somewhat spoiled for me, as somebody I know (and now despise) had the stupidity to tell me what the twist was. So, rather than appreciating what should have been an excellent exercise in astounding revelations, I sat through the movie thinking \"oooh, that's clever\" and \"of course, I understand why that happened\". I feel rather cheated out of watching it for the first time, all in all, which is more than a little disappointing. So, if you have seen the film, or you know the twist for some other reason, then keep your mouth firmly shut, and don't spoil it for others. And therin lies the film's main weakness - it is extremely vulnerable. A great deal of the film's effectiveness relies on the fact that people will not talk about it to other people who have not seen the movie. And, as we know, people have a tendency to blab.This gripe aside, \"The Sixth Sense\" gains a lot of praise (and deservedly so) for being a cunning little movie with a nice line in scaring the pants off you. I feel that a great deal of praise should also go to the studios who produced this film (Hollywood Pictures and Spyglass Entertainment), for not leaving it to fester, or become a low-budget B-movie, a straight-to-video job, as it could easily have been. These sorts of thrillers are ten-a-penny these days, and it's nice to see that they recognised Shyamalan's talent for writing and directing, and gave the project a budget, a distribution and a cast it deserved. (Although one can speculate that it's reaping the rewards by taking in a phenomenal amount of money - rightly so, too).The cinematography is well done, the soundtrack not too intrusive, and there are no appalling performances to spoil the rest of the movie's grandeur. \"The Sixth Sense\" is a good movie, pitched at exactly the right level, and it's a great night out at the cinema too.

The past few years have seen a whole bundle of 'twist' movies (Wild Things, Dead Man's Curve etc) where the final reel reveals new insights into the previous ones, but although none of them are bad movies as such, they've all seemed a bit too self-conscious - twists for the sake of it, rather than in order to genuinely stun the audience. Because you know that nothing is what it seems, you spend the movie trying to guess what the twist will be. The biggest effect it can have on you, therefore, is to mildly surprise you with the way things turned out. The success of the Sixth Sense is, like the Usual Suspects, that it only turns out to have a twist right at the very end. Most people I know who saw the Usual Suspects went to see a heist movie, and thought they'd got one right until the fateful pin-up-board-coffee-cup moment. Similarly, with the Sixth Sense, you get an effective and straightforward spooky movie which suddenly catches you by surprise. The movie has done such an effective job at this that I think it has been somewhat overrated.First of all, I admit that I knew that a twist of some sort was coming (knowing that, it became quite predictable), which, by what I've said already, means that my appreciation for the movie was dulled because it couldn't completely surprise me. The flipside is that I wasn't so awed by the twist as to be blinded by the movie's faults. It's definitely a good film - maybe an '8', and the acting is superb (especially in the mother-son scene in the car), but it's nowhere near one of the all-time top 100 movies, let alone top 10. Two main points:1. Once you remove the shock-effect of the twist, it's actually a very meagre tale. As many others have pointed out, the actual resolution of the boy's problem is given far too little weight -the film is unbalanced. Far too much of it is taken up by Bruce finding out what anybody who's seen the trailor already knows, and far too little actually deals with it.2. If you argue that the twist cannot be removed from the story as a whole - that it is simply too central, then the film must be judged on how well it is integrated into what goes before. The brilliance of the Usual Suspects is that the twist and counter-twists of the ending both explain the previous events better than the previous narrative had. It all makes so much more sense. Although the Sixth Sense is pretty tight (the first encounter between Bruce and the boy makes more sense at the end, for example), there are nonetheless big gaps, like what happened in the time between the opening Donny Wahlberg bit and the \"The Next Fall\" new scene (sorry, I'm trying really hard not to give away any spoilers). I have bigger objections still, but I don't want to give it all away (a cop-out, I admit).There are loads of good points about the Sixth Sense (the acting and the elegant direction spring most immediately to mind) which elevate it to the status of a damn good movie, but if you remove the once-only shock of the twist, what you're left with is not enough to make it a classic."}, {"rank": 143, "name": "The Sixth Sense", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "After the full-throttle media build-up, I was genuinely shocked to find how crushingly mundane this film is.

The performance of the adult cast, while convincing in themselves, is totally eclipsed by that of Haley Joel Osmet, who is simply SUPERB. Perhaps even the best performance ever by a child actor. Very, VERY intense, emotional, and moving - particularly the scene where he is locked in a cupboard at a 'friend's' birthday party. Toni Collette is the only other actor who comes close - The scene where she discovers a previously unknown truth about her mother is excellently played, despite the unusual setting for such a scene. Bruce Willis missed an opportunity with this however, playing little more than a (admittedly positive) variation on his recent characters' emotionally dry, squinty-eyed selves. Moreover, it seems a little like the filmmakers didn't get the time to include everything they wanted in this movie. I found it somewhat unconvincing that once Cole 'tests' the theory of why he is being visited, everything is suddenly perfectly cleared up, and the film ends after 15 minutes. No 'journey' by Cole, up to this point. Having said that, neither of those points detract significantly from this otherwise very entertaining picture.

The acting was OK, nothing special the plot was fairly run of the mill. The only bit that I didn't see coming was the ending - which raised it from a \"4\" to a 5. The scary parts relied on the tried and tested \"loud noise makes you jump\" formula used time and time again. Overall: By all means see this one and see it all the way to the finish as the ending is the best part."}, {"rank": 143, "name": "The Sixth Sense", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "What a good year. The Matrix put the thought back into action, The Mummy gave us fun adventure almost worthy of Indy himself, the much overlooked Go walked a great dramatic line between danger and humour, Blair Witch was incredibly inventive (albeit partly through necessity), and if my friends are to be believed Fight Club, will in turns repulse and excite me.Another movie to add to the list is definitely The Sixth Sense. How nice it is to be treated to a mature subtle film for a change. Although it's doubtful whether you could call Blair Witch or The Sixth Sense 'horror', the pair do make an effective anti-dote to the CGI tedium of The Haunting remake, reminding people that a film can live on in the mind long after the credits have rolled. It is also worthwhile approaching both films in the same manner: Ignore the hype, don't expect slick FX, just sit back and watch a nicely crafted little movie rather than the 'event' you were expecting. Less is more. So here's to more less.Unlike Blair however, there are a few traditional 'haunted house' tricks, mostly designed to startle the audience - someone suddenly walks in front of camera, or appears then disappears in the distance. 'Cheap' maybe, but also extremely effective as the camera is so still during the film that any unexpected movement becomes all the more obvious. The two leads are great, Osment is suitably fragile after home problems and ghostly visits, and Bruce is nicely calm.Problems? Well, some scenes remind me in essence of Danny in The Shining, but hey, that was 20 years ago now. A bit schmaltzy in places? Maybe, but for the most part the overal tone remains dark. It is also a little slow in places, but to be honest the final twist does reward your patience tenfold. And what about that twist? Well, knowing there was one did send my mind into overdrive, and one of the (many) possibilities I came up with was correct, but it was still a shock when confirmed. Long after leaving the theatre I was still remembering all the little details and important clues that totally passed me by, and with each new discovery my admiration grows.Maybe on my visit to Fight Club I might just have a last minute change of mind and dive into Sixth Sense again."}, {"rank": 143, "name": "The Sixth Sense", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "American ghosts, like American gothic, seem to have been imported with a lot of other European cultural baggage into the New World (though the Indians had their own), but their basic modus operandi is the same. Ghosts linger after death only if there is some unfinished business, usually if they have died a violent death that remains unavenged. They are not terribly easy to communicate with. They are also guaranteed to drop the room temperature in the most overheated living room. And of course some people are much more sensitive to ghosts than others, having a \"sixth sense\".\nGhost folklore is put to good use here in what is really an exploration of the relationship between a child psychotherapist and his patient, Cole, a sad seven year old whose parents have split up and who doesn't seem to be coping well. For that matter, the psychotherapist isn't coping too well with his problems either, his failing marriage and the memory of a patient who killed himself after. But once the Doctor accepts that the kid is really seeing things he is able to help, and he realises at the end that he has helped himself a lot too. Although the whole film has a pretty sombre tone, set in a well-observed gothic but real Philadelphia the tourist brochures are not likely to feature, it finishes on an optimistic note. Sometimes the ghosts will be able to finish their business satisfactorily, and be on their way, leaving us to carry on our lives in our own way without being haunted by the past.Bruce Willis is cast as the Doctor. An interesting choice; he has been seen mostly as an action man zombie in violent thrillers (Die Hard etc). Here he is a zombie of a different sort, reflective, sensitive, concerned, guilt-ridden. He is greatly helped by a truly stunning performance by child actor Haley Joel Osment as Cole who communicates his character's pain so well we all suffer. You don't have to believe in ghosts to feel that no seven year old should have to put up with what this kid has to bear. In a lesser role, Toni Collette does a nicely observed caring but baffled mother, single, but coping (or would be but for Cole's problem). Olivia Williams rounds out the cast as the Doctor's wife, who, after flirting with the handsome help at her shop, takes to watching their wedding video when he's late home. Donnie Wahlberg (brother of Mark) also does a nice cameo as a deranged intruder.The writer-director, M. Night Shyamalan, an ethnic East Indian brought up by his doctor parents in Philadelphia, (and who has a cameo role as an emergency room doctor here), has retold a truly ancient myth in a subdued and sombre style unusual in a mainstream Hollywood production. His handling of the scenes between Doctor and patient is quite masterly. At the end we are left with a simple but often forgotten truth: Our ghosts are about ourselves and once we recognise that we can deal with them."}, {"rank": 143, "name": "The Sixth Sense", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "A different film in many ways but one of the most entertaining I have seen for years.

The kid (his name fails me) does. The script was OK. The directing was actually poor. I won't give away the end, for the two or three people who have yet to see it, but I will say that the director gives it away by the end of the second act. When I went to see it, I knew how it would end with about a half hour left. This disappointed me. The thing was blocked poorly and the camera could have been used more effectively to keep the viewer in the dark. The thing felt like it was shot before it was really fully conceptualized. Also, there were many moments where I found myself wanting the film to be more graphic and frightening than it was. I get the feeling they were aming to get the PG-13 from start to finished.

Luckily for us, M. Night Shyamalan is as much a fan of Henry James as Stephen King, and his movie, The Sixth Sense, is a masterpiece of psychological horror that would make the writer of 'Turn of the Screw' proud. Shyamalan successfully resists the temptation to throw in cheap thrills, and instead focuses on the characters, how they react to their situation, and how they are changed by it. The audience quickly sympathizes with the young boy who can see dead people, and the broken man who feels driven to help him.Young Haley Joel Osment gives a performance that is more textured than any since Anna Paquin in the Piano, and Bruce Willis' familiar taciturn demeanour works well for him.

I have never seen more people jump or scream whilst watching a film.The most amazing thing about this film is the way it merges so many emotions, you can't help but begin to care about the characters.

I just wasn't very interested in the surprise, and didn't find that there was much more to this film. Good performances by Willis, Osment and others, and a few intense moments that were well directed, help to keep Sixth Sense from being as bad as it could have been. After seeing the ads, I though Osment would be real irritating, but he surprised me, and I think he will probably give us good to great performances for a long time to come.

The most interesting of which is that of Osment's. He keeps many secrets and refuses to tell his mother. He confides in Willis; he has got an ability to see the living dead. This ability has to be the most frightening that a child would ever have to face. The other less interesting plot concerns Willis and his wife who seem to be be growing apart.M.

Bruce Willis, after getting tired of standard issue action films, became rather irregular in choosing scripts. After the superb \"Fifth Element\", I had high hopes for the \"Sixth Sense\", but, other than the ending, there is nothing original here, it's just \"Ghost II - The Mission\".Of course, once you accept the existence of supernatural phenomena there are very few surprises left; anything is possible, since the supernatural laws seem to be very flexible. In this film there is no evident clue to strictly define it as a \"supernatural phenomena\" sort of film, so I kept wondering if there would be a natural explanation that put everything back in our physical universe, transforming it from the \"terror\" to the \"thriller\" category. No such luck. We get the same old story, so many times told. \"Some people are able to see ghosts and become scared by them at first, but ghosts are just people who died with their missions in the Earth incomplete, and they need help from living persons to finish their tasks so they can progress further to their final destiny\". Please, tell me something new, this story can become boring after a century or two.All in all, it's a linear plot, corny, absolutely humorless, full of clich\u00e9s, with flat characters.

Every actor in this movie played an important role and gave brilliant performances. Particularly Bruce Willis in his first successful serious role, definitley his best and Toni Collete for a fantastic portrayal of a single mother.Now lets get into it... This is not a scary movie, the main issue here is the afterlife which would probably fall into a supernatural/psychological drama. This movie is about one mans journey into the afterlife.As we begin the film, we see the final moments of Malcom Crowe's life. Note how his wife Anna and him communicate. When Vincent Grey actually enters the scene notice the striking physical resemblence to Cole Sear.Could they be the same person? It is possible, notice the voice simmalarity, of young vincent. This leads to a theory that Crowe's life is flashing before his eyes and has stopped at where Vincent is a boy except his name is Cole yet they are the same person, however Crowe switches into the present every time he is with his wife. Which leads to questions like: Who is the young man Anna is with? Is it a younger Malcom? Why does Anna give this young man a first edition book?Anyways back to the plot Crowe is confronted by a patient whom he has failed(Vincent/Cole?) before giving the chance to help, the patient shoots him and then himself. The movie begins one year after the murders. Crowe is waiting for Cole, and he is reading a file similar to Vincent's. Heres a question: If Crowe has been dead for a year where did he get the file? How did he know about Cole?The film then journeys into the building of Crowe and Cole's relationship, the problems and triumphs Cole and Crowe have during the process and the frustrations and understandings Cole has with his Mum.\nNotice how no one ever notices Crowe, yet Cole does. Can Cole See this? Does Cole Know Crowe is a Ghost? Now here are some things to think about: When Cole's Mum is looking at the photo's why is their no ghost's sprite when it shows the youngest picture of Cole? There are alot of first person views in Cole's house especially with his Mum,like she is being watched. These are all important but, pay attention to every scene Crowe is in and look at how he handles himself and how others handle him. He knows he is dead, he just forgets or wants to forget.Cole sees ghosts they scare him, Why doesnt Crowe scare him? Crowe helps Cole with his problem, by telling him to listen to the ghosts and they will go away. Cole does this and he infact helps one and it goes away(crosses into the afterlife) he realises that he has a gift and he shouldnt be scared. He then helps Crowe with his problem, even though Crowe was dead he didn't know how to communicate with his wife. That really is Cole's role in the movie except one bit: How did Cole open so many drawers and cupboards so quickly? Did he infact do it? Why did the hand print appear then disappear afterwards?Where as for his mum she just wanted to understand her son, and when she finally did he solved a grief she had for years and no bond could have been greater than her new bond with her son.As for Crowe he is infact the main character, and the film is about him and how he helps a boy with a great gift that others dont understand, and how he deals with the fact he is dead.The ending is a twist when watched for the first time, but when watched more than once it shows infact that even though Cole said \"people don't know their dead\" they do know they just dont want to admit it. The final moment is one of great WARMTH, LOVE, LIGHT and LIFE. The words he says here show that he in fact knew he was dead, HE JUST HAD A HARD TIME COPING WITH IT. This is a film of the ages and makes us think about death and the afterlife the way it should be looked at, this will forever be a film that will constantly bring up new things and intrigue us forever."}, {"rank": 143, "name": "The Sixth Sense", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Wow!!

Moreover, given the sinister overtones, his face is too cherubic and ungrizzled, seeming to smirk in serious scenes. Before seeing this film I had been told there was a big twist at the end but I did not know what it was. All through the film I tried to guess. I came up with the final twist but rejected it a couple of times. It is just too incredible. Now that is saying a lot when the two premises on which the film is based are that some people can see and commune with ghosts while others cannot and that ghosts can move physical objects. All that said, there is something affecting about the film. When I left the cinema the world seemed surreal.

Because Malcom is able to help Vincent/Cole, there is no reason for Vincent/Cole to kill Malcom, which breaks the cycle, so Malcom is in truth never killed.

Before I saw it, I've heard so many positive things about it, especially its surprising twist at the ending. So, then I thought that this must be a must-see film, and I decided to go and see it on the first day it was released in Australia. It was so unbelievably packed in the cinemas that almost every session was sold out on that day, and I truly had some difficulty in buying the tickets. And, the most important thing, after watching it, I was truly amazed and absolutely impressed by the movie. Brilliant original idea and marvellous performance by its actors, everyone who worked on this movie must be very proud of it. Little wonder, it has brilliant script, supported by extraordinary performances and it makes every actor in it look extremely good, especially Haley Joel Osment, Bruce Willis and Toni Collete, the leading actors...... So far, I have seen it three times, and I will be definitely going back again to watch it. The second and third time around were even better, although the surprising ending part was no longer a big surprise anymore, but really, the ending is truly the one to die for. Each time I watched it, I was truly touched by the ending and my tears just nearly burst out...... Enough said, definitely go and see this movie.... This movie will really touch your heart, even though it might not be the scariest movie you've ever seen....But without the help of any special effect, this movie does a very good job in scaring everyone out of the seats (just compare it with THE HAUNTING, it makes THE HAUNTING look like an absolute joke).... One more thing, if it doesn't get any Oscar nomination next year which I think it deserves much (Best Picture, Best Supporting Actor, Best Original Script), it will be a huge tragedy for the film industry.......

It doesn't necessarily mean thats bad. The plot basically revolves around the boys discussions with the psychiatrist (Bruce Willis) and the interaction mainly between these two characters is at the heart of the movie.The film is difficult to label. It isn't a horror, although there are some scary moments, its not a thriller though at times it is quite thrilling. I would class it as a supernatural drama. Its a strangely uneven film. I really don't know where it actually goes and what it is trying to say. Is it about the effects of loss? as the child is suffering badly because of his parents divorce. I felt that the scenes involving the children in the film were excellent . The loneliness and isolation of childhood is remarkably well presented. The scene in which the children at the party lock the boy in a cupboard is very painfull to watch.The performance by the leadinbg actor and no it is not Bruce Willis but Haley Joel Osmet is sensational. He gives a wonderful , sensitve performance. He is neither cloying or \"cute\". I loved the scenes between the boy and his mother. Toni Collette who plays the mother is excellent in this too. The scene where she and the boy discuss her mother who is dead but has given the boy a message for his mother) is excellent. Its extremely emotional and real. In some films it can be difficult to believe in a relationship between two characters but I really felt that these were mother and son.There are major gaps in the film, not least the \"twist\" but overall I liked it. I also wondered why the boys parents had divorced and where was his father. Its never really explained and the boys feelings about his father are never unearted. What does the mother work as? This is never explained either. The reason I ask this is that she seems so out of place at the childrens birthday party scene compared to the other mothers.The relationship between the Willis character and his wife is never fully developed and is quite frankly uninteresting.Overall an effective \" supernatural\" drama with some fine performances and some scary moments."}, {"rank": 143, "name": "The Sixth Sense", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "He's got the looks, he's got the charisma, he's got the talent. \"The Sixth Sense\" is the vindication of excellency of a great Hollywood star: Bruce Willis.After all, \"The Sixth Sense\" is one of these movies where you can't go wrong.

European audiences have heard about the success of this movie in the States, and have heard about there being a twist, so most of us see it expecting it to come. And if you expect it, it is really quite obvious and easy to figure out long before it happens, there are many hints (put there so that everything makes sense at the end, of course). And it's not even such an original idea, we've seen similar things in other famous movies (which I won't mention so as not to give away too much). The whole movie relies very much on this final revelation, and until it comes, it just doesn't have anything consistent to say, there is never any real feeling of menace, which surely is the worst that can happen to a horror film(I do think, though, that the performances are quite decent, especially Osment's, given the difficulty of his role.

Colette is at her finest, as usual. Haley Joel Osment is a revelation, one of the best child performances ever (note the bit in the church where, from the balcony, he talks to Willis with the weariness and sarcasm of a much-lived adult).THAT twist...well, it's reasonably unpredictable, but it's a shame it isn't really developed. In fact, the film seems to disappear into a blandness at the end which reminds you it was made in Hollywood - which is a shame, after so much good value along the way. And, as you think about the twist, you realise it's actually illogical. Oh, well, I'll say no more about it.Overall, the film will be compared to Blair Witch, though it doesn't resemble it much. What it's really like is a cross between The Shining (which is inferior) and The Innocents (which remains superior, because it is much more bitter and chilling). In fact, the appearance of the first ghost in Sixth Sense so closely resembles a moment in The Innocents, that I can't believe it's not been copied.

Its most outstanding feature is a directorial subtlety which deceives the audience right up to the last five minutes and then forces a re-evaluation of the entire film. Unfortunately this subtlety, which is undoubtedly the film's strength, has to remain unexplained. Suffice to say that for many people the highlight of 'The Sixth Sense' will be its conclusion - a fact which betrays the flaws in the film.'The Sixth Sense' lacks both pace and purpose. Its basic premise is replete with possibilities but none of these are explored. Characters are poorly drawn and lack depth. Apart from the above mentioned 'twist', much of the direction is mediocre. The film contains a few obligatory shocks but fails to maintain suspense. It is a film which continually seems to be about to get going but then grinds to a halt.The resolution of the film in relation to Haley Joel Osment's character is unsatisfying and lacks a necessary catharcism. The performances of Bruce Willis and Toni Collette are lacklustre owing the deficiencies of the screenplay and the direction. Even the film's raison d'etre - the last five minutes - is telegraphed to such an extent that the discerning viewer will work out what the 'sting in the tail' is to be.Despite this, it is almost inevitable that 'The Sixth Sense' will be a highly regarded film.

But The Sixth Sense, as I recall has possibly only one computer effect and everything else is make-up. I really liked this movie, it is a little slow moving at times, I was expecting a big budget thrill ride, but I got something out of that was so much better: I found myself concentrating on the dialogue and story, rather than thrills. It takes a really interesting story and interesting characters to make a classic movie, and I feel that The Sixth Sense has both of these.

After an initial rocky start the boy and man form a deep bond and Cole (Osment) finally decides to reveal his secret to Malcolm (Willis). Nothing prepares him for the secret and nothing will prepare him for what is to come.Bruce Willis, in which may possibly be his greatest performance, gives his character a depth in which you can sympathise with, even understand what is going on in his life, in his head, as he comes to grips with the revelation of what Cole (Haley Joel Osment) exposes to him.Haley Joel Osment is incredible in this film. His character is so intense that you can feel your fingernails digging into your skin waiting for his response to the frightening life he must live. He shows you a world, which may, or may not be there, causing your heart to jump and you to shrink back waiting for the outcome of what he sees.I admit that the movie is not for all audiences and you have to be prepared for what appears on the screen, but in saying that, the movie is not terrifying like I have read in most reviews and comments.

On the same night, however, a former child patient breaks into his house and shoots Willis while his terrified wife looks helplessly on. Cut to a year later as a recovered Willis pursues his latest patient - a troubled child who harbors a terrifying secret: he is, for reasons unbeknownst to anyone, able to catch fleeting glimpses of dead people, whom the little boy argues, are not aware they are dead. As Willis begins to slowly learn to believe the child, a warm relationship of mutual trust and bonding develops.It is this concentration on character rather than the more customary grue and gore that separates this film from so many other horror films of recent vintage. Also, the director manages to create and sustain an atmosphere of slightly off-kilter otherworldliness through the use of visual correlatives: the eternally grey October sky, shots of creepy statuary or gloomy buildings caught at odd angles, a lyrical use of shadows, leaves blowing forlornly along an empty, windswept street, a glancing glimpse of a graveyard as it momentarily catches a frightened child's sight as he races by on a city bus. It is these moments, taken as a tapestried whole, that give the film its cumulative suspenseful power.As to the film's widely heralded surprise twist ending, it will come as less of a revelation to those with a knowledge of such films as \"Carnival of Souls,\" \"Jacob's Ladder\" and \"Ghost\" from which \"The Sixth Sense\" seems to derive much inspiration. Still, the audience does leave the film feeling that it has, at least, been in the hands of a group of filmmakers who respect its intelligence and have carefully thought out the elements of the narrative before rushing the production before the cameras.

We see the boy's real fear of his visions, we learn to see him not as a monster at all, but a perfectly normal little boy who just can't tell anyone - at least not yet - why he is so tormented. His \"DO NOT ENTER\" tent in the bedroom is a great touch - a hiding place in so many ways. Plenty to fear here.Most of my complaints about this movie evaporated upon the arrival of the credits.

The little boy talks more like an adolescent that he could not be (his performance is good; it's the writing that's not believable), and throughout I felt instead of touched, emotionally manipulated (here's the music for you to feel moved, never mind that the dialogue and the situation is thoroughly cheesy).

It occupies something of the same surprising, innovative territory The Usual Suspects challenged a few years ago.\tThe Sixth Sense tells the story of an eight year old Philadelphia boy (Haley Joel Osment) who believes he can see dead people. A child psychologist called Malcom Crowe (Bruce Willis) takes the case hoping that he can help the boy.\tIt's a shame that the publicity for the film betrays the boy's secret before we see the film. We aren't told in the film until half way through what is bothering this young fellow. But this would be just about the only criticism I can level at a movie that is a triumph in so many ways, at least for a film from the Hollywood big league.\tAnd the three talents? Well writer/director N. Night Shyamalan has created an entrancing film which is spooky in the pre-special effects fashion. The Sixth Sense doesn't rely on digital monsters but on much subtler techniques. The half glance, the fleeting shadow and at a push the sudden loud noise are layered upon a cleverly worked script and some very effective, sometimes clever camera technique.\tShyamalan (pronounced SHA-mah-lahn and I gather called Night by his mates) is a 29 year old American of Indian extraction who has been entranced with film since his early years. He had produced 45 short films by the age of 16! The Sixth Sense is his third feature film following Praying With Anger in which he also starred, and then Wide Awake in 1997. \tThe Sixth Sense will definitely catapult Shyamalan into the top category of directors.\tThen for our second on the list there's Haley Joel Osment who in spite of being only 10 years old gives a superb, knowing performance. This is no first flash in the pan effort from Osment. He has been in films and on stage for five years. He was the young Forrest Gump and also played Avery Brown on Murphy Brown. He had a plum role on Ally McBeal for which he was nominated for an Emmy Award.\tThe third talent would have to be that superb actor Bruce Willis. He again shows that his talents extend far beyond lunging around gun in hand. He years ago played the lead in Sam Shepard's play Fool For Love which ran for five years off Broadway. Consider his almost unrecognisable performance in Die For You and his perplexed cop in The Fifth Element before you write Willis off as some idiot action star. Anyway he was great in Die Hard.\tAnd Australia's Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding, Lillian's Story, The Pallbearer) nearly made the list for her touching performance as the young boy's mother.\tThe Sixth Sense somehow avoids the mawkishness of the awful Ghost and is miles ahead of The Haunting, the other ghostly film on show now. The essential trick upon which the film is based remained hidden for me, as it will I think for nearly everyone.\tIt isn't horrifying but is a bit spooky and thought provoking. It's fine entertainment."}, {"rank": 143, "name": "The Sixth Sense", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "It has been more than six weeks since I have seen this movie.

What it amounts to is a journey that the viewer doesn't know he is taking. Most horror films leave you at the end with a feeling of dread, relief, or remembered shock, but this is the first horror movie that filled me with joy at the end - and that's the most amazing thing about it. The other amazing thing is the sheer intelligence of this script throughout.\nI'm not as impressed as some with Willis's acting - I thought it was serviceable and filled the bill. It was, however, great casting, because having him in there made the viewer start to expect a real \"Night of the Living Dead\" gorefest climax - Bruce against the zombies! Light the torches! - concealing the true nature of this movie until the end. But Osmont's acting - and the way he was directed - had me completely sympathizing with him; both his fright and bewilderment, and his later courage in being able to talk to the unwelcome visitor in the playhouse, were entirely convincing and moving.I will see this movie again; I don't think it's making too much of it to say that it's got enough ambiguities and layers of meanings to justify repeated viewings. I don't think that it will get the Oscar for Best Picture of the year; it may not even be nominated, and I'm not certain that it will deserve it. It's clearly not an Oscar-oriented picture, in that it doesn't have the Big Gesture, the Good Costumes, the Big Sinking Boat, the Grand Theme, the Anthony Hopkins appearance, and not a strand of classical music in sight or sound.

Plot twists are numerous, and you are always guessing what is going on, BUT YOU RARELY GET IT RIGHT!

It was rather amusing to look at the faces and hear the conversations of those around us as the movie was letting out.

I still wasn't shocked, though, because it made sense, etc.As for the rest of the movie, I thought it was pretty good. It could very easily have been done as a cheap, gory horror flick, but in the hands of the director (I forgot his name), it actually exhibits a great deal of intelligence and a nice mix of the supernatural and religion. Yes, Haley Joel Osmont is very good in a role that requires a good deal more maturity than most kids' roles today. He has many of the frightening moments, and they're all frightening in his hands. But he also is effective as the frightened little boy who has a very simple desire we all can relate to: not to be called a freak. Bruce Willis was just okay, but Toni Collette, who plays Osmont's mother, did a good job, as well. The story as it is presented is very chilling, if not very scary. There are quite a few frightening bumps along the way, but none that are truly nightmare-inducing. That's probably because this movie is well above the rest of its genre (Maybe not The Blair Witch Project, but I haven't seen that one.) and fits more into the drama area of movies.

I thought the plot was constructed well, and the characters were also developed well.

So, I've watched its progress at the US Box Office over the net, and I've read the poor reviews as well. So, I can't explain why it did so well ($220+ million) at the Box Office because it isn't really a mainstream cinema-goers movie. On the other hand, I thought the critics would love it, but they definitely did not embrace it. So, the IMDB voters poll is, in my opinion the only true poll for this movie at 8.8 avg.

Guard your comments when talking to those in the know, because you never know who might just be passing by that you spoil it for. I know how much it hurts, for the secrets to both 'The Crying Game' and 'The Usual Suspects' were given away to me by so-called friends.That out of the way, I must say that 'The Sixth Sense' is as almost perfect film. Bruce Willis acts masterfully in a role that one at first might think him mis-cast for and Haley Joel Osment puts in a performance far superior to much of the adult acting I have seen in recent years. It has been a long time since a child has been called to play such a difficult role, and I can't control my dismay that he was not cast as Anakin Skywalker in the newest Star Wars episode. Of course, Jake Lloyd might have done just as well under the awesome skill of writer/director M. Night Shymalan. The story is meticulously crafted, and the ending is a true mind-blower.

But instead of gruesome scenes with plenty of blood and gore, the film takes a more intelligent, dark, yet riveting path. It combines elements of several genres, including horror, but also drama and thriller.The plot focuses on the relationship between child psychologist Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) and Cole (Hayley Joel Osment), the young boy. Having apparently failed a similar young boy years before, Malcolm is determined to rectify his previous failure, and in doing so, redeem himself. This is especially so after the boy he failed, now a man, broke into his house, shooting Malcolm before turning the gun on himself.The acting was top notch, particularly Willis, Osment and Collette (Cole's mother), and on a couple of occasions I was truly scared, having no idea what was going to happen. Few films today (The Blair Witch Project is perhaps the exception) are able to truly scare an audience, but this certainly is one.What makes this film really good however, is the twist at the end. If you haven't watched the film, now is a good time to stop reading, otherwise, keep going.Anyway, to find out that Malcolm had been dead all along when he was originally shot (and he didn't even know it) was very clever, and during the film you don't have a clue. But when that realisation comes, it suddenly clicks. \"Sometimes they don't even know they're dead\", Cole once said. Very apt.All in all, a very good film that'll make you scared at times, but is very cleverly crafted, and makes you think. It's nice to see Willis portray a more serious and complex character; certainly a pleasant change."}, {"rank": 143, "name": "The Sixth Sense", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "This movie was a lot different than I expected.

Number one (and I am not being humorous)was the silly and so very obvious hair piece perched atop Bruce Willis's bald cranium. At first I found it quite distracting, with my focus continuously wandering up to that area. I was mostly able to work through this as the film progressed, but was never able to completely avoid its niggling presence. Secondly, the bizarre and phantasmagoric plot required just a little too much suspension of what is left of my intellect to be entirely persuasive in a film so deadly serious in its portent. I also found the effects makeup of the dead people very unconvincing and rather poorly done. Finally, Bruce Willis is, in my opinion, not a very good actor. Competent, yes, particularly when involved in one of his action/adventure vehicles where charisma and presence are required more than acting excellence. I do realize, however, that the constraints of the script and the grim mood of this film did require a rather somber and wooden approach to the portrayal of his character. Happily, all of this is forgotten with the superb performance of young master Osment playing the part of the boy, Cole, along with an excellent and convincing job by Toni Collette as his mother. The very last scenes of the movie were obviously designed to shamelessly extract all possible moisture from one's tear ducts, including mine, but upon leaving the theater, I was able to apply my most useful and stringent criterion for judging a film: how long did it stay with me? An hour, 5 hours, the next day?

It's an allegory for all our nameless fears that we have to fight alone because nobody else shares them.Besides the plot, multiple other elements come into play in making \"The Sixth Sense\" the sensation that it is. The acting is superb on all ends. Haley Joel Osment plays Cole with an impressively haunted maturity, and Bruce Willis stays out of his way. And for such relatively small parts, the ghosts give off near-visible auras of otherworldly anger and fear.The other main element in the psychological terror behind the movie is how it attempts to instill fear in the audience. Transcending flashing lights and computer-generated wraiths, \"The Sixth Sense\" goes instead for suggestions of cold and some sharp makeup effects. And not to be forgotten is the score, which chilled me deeper than most of the visual elements.One thing that everyone wants to talk about is the ending.

Actually, I made that up, because this isn't your typical Bruce film, but it is a very good one. Bruce does very well in it, as the shrink tormented by ghosts of his own. His performance is reminiscent of Jimmy Stewart in Vertigo and the film as a whole has a similar dreamlike feel to it. The film covers similar ground thematically too - the corruption of the past by the present, the hold the dead have on the living. Both Bruce and the boy are in the grip of the past and this is evoked by haunting images of Philadelphia hanging malevolently over them both. The other performances are very fine too. The young boy conveys his terror and incomprehension very well and Toni Collette (\"You're TERRIBLE Muriel!\") is convincing as the fraught mother, trying to save her son from something she can't even comprehend. The film has a washed-out, dead look to it, similar to The Exorcist and the film probes similar anxieties (the mother's impotence to protect her child from abuse). But this is a much more compassionate film than The Exorcist and stays away from in-your-face horror, inducing instead a low-key feeling of tension and unease. It's beautifully shot, well acted, cleverly written and rather creepy.

The whole film was built ground up from the ending, and no film has ever made it so painfully obvious that the ending was written first and then a story was added to make it long enough. Also I have a terrible bit of information to tell everyone, Bruce Willis is really bad at acting like he cares. It didn't work in Armageddon, it doesn't work here, and it's not going to work the next time he's cast as a truly caring man. Though in all honesty if you think about this film in great detail you realize he does not care, and is simply incredibly self-serving. Despite all my personal distaste for this film, it is not one of the worst movies ever made, but it is nothing more than average. The plot is relatively simple, and if you go into the theater actually thinking you'll know how the movie is going to end within half an hour. The only real reason to see this movie is so that you can see if you can figure out the ending before the end of the film. After you've seen this once and seen how it ends, it is incredibly unlikely that the weak plot line will be enough to draw you back for a second time.

The plot begins slowly (a little too slowly?) but eventually develops into an ending that leaves you breathless.I've seen the film twice now, and can vouch that it takes more than ending to create a great film. The Sixth Sense succeeds. Moments are scary, or emotional, or just plain powerful. If you're a true \"movie-goer\" and immerse yourself into this film (which is easily done given the great score and excellent directing) then you should find yourself shuddering more than once.The acting is exceptional, Bruce Willis - taking into account his recent jobs - is surprisingly good. The boy and his mother are believable, and the character interaction is very nice. The film quality is dark and granular, giving you a strong sense of realism - like watching a documentary. Just like \"Saving Private Ryan\", great steps were taken to build scenes using mood and emotion.The ending does much more than complete this great film. You will find yourself pleasantly surprised and in many cases your draw will land in your popcorn. Once you figure this out, you'll be thinking about it all the way to your car.

For me, it is a picture of a very real possibility.

In fact, replace Willis with another unknown actor and what you get is...AN INDEPENDENT FILM. This is not a big studio thriller (a la the Haunting); it is very much an independent film in its careful plotting, its pacing, and its ambitious ideas. I love that this film has captured America's attention as it is a reason why independent film and independent filmmakers are forces to reckon with and pay attention to. My hat is off to M.

A WHOLE lot more than I expected to--the preview made it look even worse than Bruce's last \"child-helping\" film (something about a computer virus, right?)

I don't believe that Cole's \"gift\" should have been publicized. The film would have been much better if it hadn't been, but to be fair, it would have been difficult to sell it any other way.If we lived in a perfect world and Access Hollywood, Entertainment Tonight and E! didn't exist, imagine how bizarre this film would have been, with the viewer not exactly knowing what was going on until Cole's confession. So to those with their holier-than-thou critiques of this film, saying that it doesn't try to go beyond the typical boundaries of Hollywood filmmaking, I say that you're wrong. This is a psychological drama that is also a horror film, not the other way around. There are very few films that can even claim to do the same.

The wonderful relationship that evolves between Malcolm and Cole is worth the price of admission alone. Also kudos to Toni Collette as Cole's ever-loving, always supportive Mom; to Olivia Williams as Malcolm's wife (in hindsight, one realizes that Williams pulls off an incredibly difficult technical piece of acting), and Donnie Wahlberg as Vincent, the anguished, tortured young man whom Malcolm could not save.

It's a great movie for teens and adults. At times it's scry, suspensefull, and mysterious. To make it even better, it has a twisted ending.The acting in this movie was very good because it was realistic. When the boy by the name of Cole said that he saw dead people it was belivable by the way he acted. I also liked his reactions when he would see or hear dead people. Another good actor in this movie was the psychologist played by Bruce Willis. He was especially good when he convinced the young Cole to stop running and hiding from the ghosts and find out what they really wanted and why were they haunting him.This movie was full of suspense because you never knew what was going to happen next. When the doctor was shot I was in suspense wondering if he was going to die or not.Other parts that demonstrated suspense were when the ghost came, because you don't know what they are going to do.My opinion is that this was a great movie, an A+.

The criteria for a movie like this one is that it has to be scary, full of surprises, have a good plot, make sense, and have a good ending. This movie had it all!The main thing that made this movie especially scary was the ghosts- not just one or two, but a whole army of zombie-like ghouls who haunt the gothic streets of modern Philadelphia. The ghosts follow this boy named Cole, because they seem to want something from him. The thing that makes that scary is that you as the viewer or him as the person don't know what they want from him until the end. It is very suspenseful. The other thing that makes this movie scary was that you didnt know if Cole was crazy because he was the only one who could seem them. But then you find out that he's not crazy, and that all the ghosts are really there to him, and that they need his help.I think that the movie was good because of the fabulous ending. The ending really got you thinking. Not just about how it ended, but the whole movie. It just made you reflect back and go through the movie to see if the ending matched up to the movie. Another thing that made the ending really good was that it was very scary. The movie was extremely good and scary, The whole movie was made very well, and it was obvious it had a lot of time and effort put into it. The ghosts were great special effects and gave the movie and eerie feeling. The end just tied up the whole movie, like movies should. But this endng was especially well done.

He made it seem real when he had to use his emotions. By having a child in this movie it brought back memories to me and I'm sure to all the adults. Memories of ghosts that they thought they saw.

A good movie keeps you hooked eyes glued to the screen hands gripping the armrests and feet plastered to the ground. A good movie sets you up throught the whole thing then surprises you with a shocking mind boggling ending. The sixth sense delivered all this and more The key to a truely intriguing movie is in the acting. Bruise Willis gave a wonderful performance as usual but Haley was shockingly better probably the best child actors I've ever seen. When Cole (Haley) gets locked in the attic by two of his schoolmates and was beat up by the ghost you could feel his pain it was almost real. Cole helping us find out how the young girl really died.Throughout the whole movie you wondered about Malcome's relationship with his wife, for example when she sat waiting for him at a restraunt on their anniversary when he finally showed up and tried to pay the bill but she took it from him ( that was harsh). Scenes like that keep the movie going and hinted around a future occurrence. but it was the part when the little boy told his mother that grandma said hi and that she did go to her daughters dance recitle years ago when they had gotten in a fight. That was when you knew the mother believed him. In my opinion this movie The Sixth sense is very good worth every penny and more.

It had an awesome plot,great casting and acting!! This movie was very easy to follow with many twists,turns and cool make-up. This movie kept me glued to my seat!\nSome of the best scene that showed the most amazing acting was when the little boy woke up in the middle of the night and wandered into the kitchen only to find a dead woman looking for something in the cupboards.When she started to talk to him the poor boy got frightened(as would most any one)and ran back to his little red tent and began to shiver and cry. This scene was amazing because of the great make-up.The little boy acted like he had really seen a ghost! Another time that the little boy showed great acting was when he first told Bruce Willis about his terrifying secret. This was an amazing scene because he cried like he really could see ghosts.\nWhen you see some really good make-up it makes the movie much better and more life like. When you see this awesome make-up is when one of the dead people talks to the little boy and then turns around you see a bloody head. The had been shot off by accidental gun fire. This make-up made the movie more life like and seem like the ghosts were actually there. The best scene though, is when the boy is talking to a woman she moves so you can see the other side of her face to realize that she is actually dead. The one side had been burned to a very crispy person. This was the best make-up I have ever seen in this kind of horror flick.\nIn conclusion I think that this is a must see movie, not only for the theaters but a good one for keeps!This summer I have also seen the Haunting of the hill house and that movie was lame compared to this brilliant move.

It had all key elements that make for a great movie. It was creative, original, and above all completely terrifying. A part in the movie that got to me most was when Haley Joel Osmit says, \"Ya know those prickly hairs on the back of your neck? That's them.\" He's referring to the ghosts and what makes it more scary is that we have never had any explanation for hairs standing on end; except for the fact that we are cold. The movies uses that and says that when ghosts are around the temperature drops, making us cold, and giving us goose bumps. In fact, almost anything pulled from the movie could and would be considered both scary and creative. The movie was undoubtedly scary. It was the type that made the whole theater scream with terror and gasp at anything interesting. It captivated the audience. But what made it do that was it's unpredictable horror. In most horrors you only see dead people at night; whether they're just being killed or rising from the dead. In this movie dead people show up in broad daylight. Also, you see the dead after whatever it was that killed them. In one case, you see a little boy that was shot in the head. The suspense is endless and the surprises are non-stop. One thing can be said about it, it will make you grasp your neighbors arm as your mouth drops wide open.The Sixth Sense made for a great summer movie because it had creativity and originality. The Sixth Sense defies all rules for your average horror film. First off, most horrors have a killer that pops out and scares the audience. The Sixth Sense does not have a murderer and is still tens times scarier than any thriller. You never seem to know when another dead person will show up. Some can even come in a matter of seconds and we don't even see them. Also, the shocking end to the perfect movie. The end alone would have been enough creativity and originality for the whole movie. (Don't worry, I won't spoil the ending, even though it was wonderful, but I called it!) The ending and plot alone show how The Sixth Sense doesn't follow the guidelines set for thrillers and goes off to explore uncharted territory, that turned out to be a gold mine!Kellie, a San Ramon High School student"}, {"rank": 143, "name": "The Sixth Sense", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "This summer I saw the movie The Sixth Sense. It was a scary, disturbing drama. the movie was a sure fire Oscar award. The criteria for that kind of a movie should be good acting and a great ending. Bruce Willis starred and played a psychiatrist and Haley Joel Osmet played a little boy who can see dead people.I thought this movie had excellent acting. Both actors should be nominated for an award of some sort. Willis, for example, was in a scene where he was listening to a recorded conversation. He had to find out if there was some one else in the room that he didn't see. He acted some what scared, surprised and deep in thought, when he faintly heard the other voice. I thought it was good acting because he had to portray so many feelings at the same time. Another scene where great acting skills came in, was when the Osmet was running into his tent to hide from a dead person. They showed him sitting in the corner of the tent crying with the most terrified look on his face. From the look on his face it made you feel as terrified as he was. These two examples show the fine skills of the actors.\nThe Sixth Sense had absolutely the best ending any movie has ever had. It made the entire movie theater full of people say, \" Oh, my gosh!\" I won't give away the ending so as not to spoil a great surprise. This ending made you go back and rethink the whole movie. It was a story that made sense because of the ending. I really liked this ending because it wasn't 100 percent happy, as so many movies are. It left you thinking about the movie the entire night long. The ending of this movie was full of different emotions: it was scary, it was smart, it was sad, it was happy, it was unusual.I recommend this movie to anyone who likes superior acting and a movie that makes you think twice, along with a magnificent ending. These two criteria make up a disturbing drama. In a summer full of supposedly scary slasher teen movies, The Sixth Sense is a rare combination of variety of emotions in a well- acted, smart plot movie.

This summer am I glad I got out to the movie theaters and saw The Sixth Sense. This action-packed thriller certainly kept me on the edge of my seat. The suspense is incredible and the dead people popping up where ever will definately give you the chills. Bruce Willis and the child actor who played the 10 year old boy do a wonderful job in this picture trying to scare you half to death and be pleading for more. Like I said before, the suspense is incredible. Like when the girl who gets poisened haunt the 10 year old boy, you're dying to get to the bottom of the story. Even if the horror isn't scary enough or the blood isn't gory enough, the suspense will keep you in the theater until the credits. Before I go any further, let me just say that the child actor does the best child acting I have ever seen. His cleaver imagination makes you believe that he really can see dead people. For example, when he is playing a little mind game with Bruce Willis, he looks up and down at the end making it seem like there is someone there standing next to him. But just the way everything fits together, it's like a puzzle. The kid is simply just amazing. Therefore I conclude that The Sixth Sense was certainly a well put together film that will wow you.

The performances by Osment and Collette are excellent but it doesn't make up for the tedious pace of the plot. Two-thirds of the movie deals with exposition which, in this case, is devoted to the interaction between Cole (Osment) and Malcolm (Willis). Cole's got a problem and Malcolm is determined to help him - as his problem is similar to one that another patient of his had whom he couldn't help. The problem is that we already know what Cole's problem is so we're left with an anti-climactic climax. When he tells Malcolm that he sees dead people, there's no shock value or significance. That leaves the resolution to Cole's problem as the focal point of the movie; however, it's so tame it makes you wonder what the big deal was in the first place.\nThe movie works best when Cole and his mother (Collette) are together. There's a particular scene at the end when they are in the car that is incredibly touching. The movie breaks down when it tries to be scary, though. There are a few startling scenes but, overall, it's devoid of any real terror. How it was labeled as a horror movie, I'll never understand.\nOverall, it's a pretty decent movie - much better than what Hollywood usually puts out - but, in the end, it's nothing to write home about.

When the Sixth Sense is called an \"intelligent\" movie by critics, something is very very wrong.Having said that, it's not an absolutely horrible movie. The acting is passable, and the story is somewhat interesting. The slower pace is admirable in a time when most movies seem to be focused on special effects like exploding tits every thirty seconds, and it worked well toward contributing to the aura of the film.But the film wasn't really scary. A couple of \"Boo!\" type scenes, but nothing that really got inside me that much. I hate to make the comparison that everyone else seems to be making but I've got to say that \"The Blair Witch Project\" was infinitely more scary and effective.If you want to see a couple creepy surprise-ending films, go rent \"Jacob's Ladder\" and \"Angel Heart\" both are much more scary, interesting, and smart, and both deserve your attention much more than \"The Sixth Sense.\""}, {"rank": 143, "name": "The Sixth Sense", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "I've never seen anything like this.

Night Shyamalan's credit that \"The Sixth Sense\" reverberates with such heartening force.I cannot adequately express in such a short space how impressive this movie really is. What Hollywood has needed for so long is fresh talent, and in Shyamalan and Haley Joel Osment, it is unearthed. As for Bruce Willis, the assessment that he is a one-dimensional, prototype badass character is unfair. He lets \"The Sixth Sense\" come to him, never emoting, a trait that has victimized some of his lesser Hollywood compatriots.\"The Sixth Sense\" deserves all the merit it has received, and I think Shyamalan will reap what he has sown once Academy Award nominations are announced.

You can actually FEEL his fear and you can really sympathize with him. The scenes with him and his mother are very touching. No, this is more than just a horror flick. One of the scenes that I can't forget is when Osment looks steadfastly away from the dead bodies hanging from a beam at his school. He doesn't scream or anything, but that scene carries weight, it tells you that the boy has seen this type of things many times. Another one is when he tells Willis at the hospital that he sees dead people around him, who don't know they're dead, and they see only what they want to see. Creepy.

Shyamalan does a good job of showing people relate in _pictures_ (true, a necessity afforded by the plot); it's so much easier, but not nearly so powerful, to let words do all the work. Great decision to shoot in old Philadelphia, too.

They used your typical formula of scare tactics to make the audience jump (let it get dark, make the music scary and then have something unidentifiable jump across the screen). You really have no choice but to react, your body can't stop it, but this has been called \"scary\". And it didn't even happen that often in the movie.2. The movie dragged in too many spots for me to even start describing them. I kept saying to myself (get on with it, etc...)3. They made the movie confusing only to give the appearance of a \"surprise ending\". True I didn't realize their real ending...4. Wow! The camera work. I have heard of poor filmmaking but this is unreal. I keep hearing people who don't like the Blair Witch Project because of the unstable camera (most of those people don't realize its neccesity) but this movie was made in the third person using a lot of money and I was still having flashbacks of the BWP. This movie was supposed to have stable shots but I kept getting annoyed when the camera would struggle like a homevideo.5. They never developed any character. Especially the boy. I wanted to know more about his relationships with the ghosts. What did they want, why were they there? But they never tell you.Therefore if you are so inclined to watch your typical wonderbread \"horror\" film (that isn't even as good as Friday the 13th part 8 go ahead and pay the 6-9 dollars to see it.

Think of the plot twist (which is revealed at the very end) like a fine silk robe.Except it's ruined because it's full of holes.In the beginning of the movie, the psycho shoots Bruce Willis and kills himself.Then it says \"NEXT FALL\", and the movie continues from there. Over a year later, where Bruce Willis meets the boy.That's first hole. Would Bruce Willis go for over a year not knowing the secret? (By, the secret, I mean what you, the viewer, would know after the plot twist is revealed, at the end of the movie.)Also, if the secret would hold true, Cole's (The boy's) mother should never have spoken with Bruce Willis.Also, all of the ghosts that the boy sees are scary. They all have their death marks on them. The 1970's teen ghost has his head blown off. The girl ghost pukes up her poisoned insides. The housewife ghost shows her slashed wrists. But the secret of the movie does not follow this same pattern with the doctor ghost. You never see any wounds on the doctor ghost. Hmm... well unless that's because he never turns his back during the whole movie?? You wouldn't see the wound on the 1970's teen ghost if he never turned around either... but I'm not sure... maybe I should watch it again?... Also, none of the other ghosts speak. They stare blankly and then walk away. Why would that ghost doctor speak then?????? It makes no sense!!!The worst part is, again, that it continues over a year later after Bruce Willis gets wounded. I mean, Bruce Willis would NOT have gone for over a year without knowing the secret. Seriously. If all the other points I listed above where little holes in my silk robe, pin holes even, then this fact is like a giant tear.

This is easily one of the best 3 films of year (among The Matrix, EdTV and Thomas Crown).

Haley Joe Osment gives the best child performance I've ever seen (even topping those given in CE3K and ET and Sleepers) as a sweet and troubled child who sees ghost. He should be a lock for a nomination for best lead actor Oscar (but then again \"Shakespeare...\" won a \"best film\" Oscar last year). Bruce Willis is wonderful as a sympathetic shrink trying to treat the kid (anybody who saw \"Nobody's Fool\" will not be surprised by his work here) and Toni Collette (who?) is just right as the kid's mom. Also Olivia Williams is very fine and very beautiful as Willis's wife. Writer-director M. Night Smyamalan trusts the intelligence of his audience by giving us a screenplay as heart-tugging as \"Titanic\" or \"Field Of Dreams\". The scares here are creepy but not shocking. He's too smart for that and they work because we really care about the people in the movie. His direction is virtually perfect.

The real treasure of the film is Haley Joel Osment. He gives the greatest child performance I have ever seen. It would be a travesty if he doesn't win Best Supporting Actor at the Academy Awards next year. Osment's performance makes me, as a theatre-acting major at University Of Illinois, feel envious of him, which I feel is a pathetic emotion. The writing and direction is flawless. The pacing is slow, but slow for a reason. We get a real sense of the characters and the situation and it makes us care about every one of them and their outcome. The ending, as many have said, is shocking and very effective. Nothing can prepare you for it; it's the best climax since, should I say, \"The Usual Suspects.\" The ending makes you look at the film in an entirely different prospective and that is one of the film's greatest achievements.

He stole every scene in the film and was so perfectly casted. If only they had him play Anakin Skywalker, we'd be talking masterpiece for George Lucas.

So now a movie that really did deserve to be on the top 250 is knocked off even if it really did deserve Best Picture (come'on, if The Full Monty won would that make you happy?).

It was also about family; his relationship with his mother, and about single parenting. I thought Haley and Bruce Willis acted well together (they clicked well). I think Bruce's character was kind of laid back. But maybe that was on purpose; Bruce allowed the very talented Haley Joel Osment to take center stage. I've seen Haley in other projects and he always seems to stand out. I think Haley was the star of this movie. The actress who played his mother was also great as the divorced mom. I really loved that scene in the car between mother and son. Brought tears to my eyes. When I got home, I replayed all the scenes in my head and told myself that I wouldn't mind seeing it again (before it comes on cable or on video). And oh, what a great, and creative ending.

Bruce Willis plays Malcolm Crow, a doctor who was recently awarded a citation for his work. It is after a frightening encounter with a patient from his past that Crow meets Cole, a paranoid little boy in desperate need of a chewable prozac. M Night Shyamalan directs this brilliant film, slowly unraveling a secret that this boy is too frightened to face, and too unwilling to confess. We soon learn that this child can see ghosts, and Malcolm Crow might be the only person that can help him through his frightening ordeal. \nHaley Joel Osment, who plays the role of Cole, is so brilliant that I predict he will be nominated (and perhaps should win) an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor. Toni Collette (Muriel's Wedding) does an admirable job playing the mother who can't understand what is happening to her son. \nYes, this film has a shocking ending (brilliant, in fact) and don't dare let anyone ruin it for you.

From the outset the story tears at the inside of your mind and seeks a comfortable place to hide, a warm understanding place to call home. This movie slowly creates its premise from the veil that shrouds the spirit world and pulls you into a place that is both familiar and uneasy. This is the small noise in the night not the loud shrieking of banshees. With out a doubt M. Night Shyamalan has written and directed a brilliant look at the spirit world, his command of character and plot and the compelling use of camera and editing reminds one of Hitchcock or a more mature contemporary director like Altman in the Gingerbread Man. Though much of the focus has rightly been on the child actor Haley Joel Osment and tough guy Bruce Willis' re-birth as a charming and complex vehicle, the cohesion and mounting tension of the film owe much to the well thought out work of Shyamalan. Starting with the development of a wonderful chemistry between the actors and their slow developed interaction with each other the writer-director M. Night Shyamalan weaves a work that somehow keeps you both pressed back into and at the same time on the edge of your seat. He is the face that we see in the firelight for he tells stories in much the same way that other master storytellers do \u0096 slowly building up each piece of his fantasy world. It clearly is Shyamalan that continually surprises us with small feints and intricate maneuvers, for me it was his work that was a pleasure to watch. On the other hand the inspired Osment / Willis pairing is also a treat - reasoned, well paced and seasoned with the just the right about of well spoken lines and haunting \u0096 haunted looks. The other cast members major and minor also help to round out a believable story. This was a true example of movie as a team sport!Shyamalan is a talent that knows what buttons to push, this is not someone who feels he has to shock us every minute to scare us or preach to us every minute to open us up to new ways of thinking. He slowly reveals to us our uneasiness with things in the natural world - like houses that creak in the night. What a complete story, what a deep imagination. This is a story of restless passion that takes hold of you and won't let you go. Even after you return home something will gnaw at you.

He creates an air to the film, it creeps you out, and may even scare you. He does this without millions of dollars in special effects, he simply does it with make-up, a great script, and great direction. The script isn't great just because it can creep you out however, nor is it the marvelous ending, instead it's the fact that the script plays the viewer like a piano. The writer/director makes us make these simple assumptions. Little things. Things so common that they don't need to be said, and then he has us slapping our forehead for making the assumption later.

Another dumpy special effects bonanza with CGI ghosts, no plot, and bad acting. Just what we need. The critics rave reviews got me interested(they should advertise the movie). I went to see it, and was, to say the least, delighted with what I saw. I was deeply touched by it. It's not some scary monster movie with corny acting and CGI ghosts like the remake of \"The Haunting\". In fact, there isn't a single special effect in \"The Sixth Sense\". Not one. It doesn't need effects, because it's about facing the most frightening point of our lives, death. I walked out of the theater feeling the same way as I did when I came out of Roberto Benigni's \"Life is Beautiful\", and that was very happy. This is the first film about death that made me feel good, and ready to accept death at the time I may face it. \"Ghost\" is the wrong film to watch, because it made me scared of death. \"The Seventh Seal\" was about using the time you have left to live, so that didn't have a real positive impact on me either. \"The Sixth Sense\" did, and I was really happy about it. Despite it's 1 or 2 Hollywood cliches, \"The Sixth Sense\" is an important film for our lives because it teaches us to face death, to accept it, and to not be afraid. There were times in the movie when I thought to myself, why are the spirits the boy sees splattered with gore, blood, and muck? Is this supposed to scare us? Are blood and gore Hollywood's only idea of death? No. It's simply the way the spirits died. The tagline says, \"Not every gift is a blessing\". I disagree. I thought that the boy WAS blessed with a gift, yet he was frightened by it and he did not understand it. I think the advertising campaign needs to rethink their methods of advertising \"The Sixth Sense\", because they make it look like a stupid special effects fest, which it is not. I would remove some of the cliches here and there, and I still think \"The Blair Witch Project\" is the best film of the year. Still, I liked this film very much.

It's not a scary movie that's frightening because it's gross and disgusting. It's a scary movie that's simply scary, without special effects or excessive gore, which, to me, is the greatest kind of thriller that we see too little of these days._The Sixth Sense_ is exquisitely acted, written, and directed, with a score that brings the film chillingly to life. Bruce Willis (Malcolm Crowe) and Haley Joel Osment (Cole Sear) have a chemistry and power together that is utterly believable. Their performances almost make you suspend reality and believe that the characters are real people.Another thing that struck me is the attention to detail and the research that went into the storyline. Being a paranormal buff, the movie didn't look too promising as far as realistic paranormal investigation goes. However, the attention to free association writing, electronic voice phenomena, cold spots, a spirit's violent actions, and the stress the ability to \"see dead people\" puts on someone, especially a young child, was amazing. If you're into ghosts and the paranormal, this is definitely a film for you, and will strike you as being more than just \"a scary movie.\"Just a word of warning: Don't let your guard down. If you don't like sudden parts, this may not be a movie for you. Go with a friend or family member who's already seen it and can tell you if something is sudden is going to happen. I usually don't like movies with any sudden parts, but I think this film, without that suspense, would not nearly be as good.I don't think there was anything that I didn't like about the movie... it's most definitely worth the ticket price and should be seen on the big screen in order to get the full effect, like _The Haunting_. I guarantee the story will keep you on the edge of your seat, and the ending will shock you - Everyone says it, don't think it's hype. It really will.

Dispirited, the good doctor finds himself burnt out and emotionally distant from his wife Anna (Olivia Williams.) Then along comes young Cole Sear (Haley Joel Osment,) an eight-year-old boy clearly struggling with inner demons. Cole's mother Lynn (Toni Collette) is having difficulty enough raising the boy on her own. It does not help that the child is shy, sullen, and prone to sudden fits of unexplained panic. Grasping for redemption, Dr. Crowe treats the troubled lad, eventually befriending him. For only when Crowe earns Cole's trust can the boy fully explain his secret. It would be wrong of me to divulge anything further. The rest of the movie's secrets I shall leave for you to discover.The Sixth Sense is a triumph of tone and ambiance. It manages to startle us, to make us grab the forearm of the person at our side, and to gasp at strategic moments. With the aid of cinematographer Tak Fujimoto (The Silence of the Lambs), director M. Night Shyamalan infuses every shot with dread and foreboding. In short, it is a highly successful thriller. Yet its most impressive accomplishment is that it does not skimp on drama. The movie is populated with three-dimensional characters that behave in real and honest ways. Take Toni Collette as the boy's mother. In a standard thriller, this character would be a throw-away, serving no purpose other than to complain to her son and disbelieve him at crucial points. But in The Sixth Sense, the mother is a concerned parent who is struggling to put food on the table and maintain her own sanity, much less the sanity of her son. She is a living, breathing person with strengths and weaknesses. As a result, we empathize with her. The same holds true for all of the supporting players, including the Doctor's neglected wife.The heart of the movie lies is the burgeoning friendship between Willis and Osment. It works wonderfully, thanks in large part to Osment's outstanding performance. Not since Radio Flyer and E.T. have I been so impressed with a young actor's abilities. When the boy is in the throes of a panic attack, you feel it. When he warily backs away from Dr. Crowe during their first meeting, you feel his hesitation as if it were your own. By his own standards, Bruce Willis turns in a relatively strong performance. It may lack the emotion of In Country and the flair of Death Becomes Her, but it is certainly two notches above his typical action work, such as his role in Striking Distance. One element that I found lacking for much of the film was the relationship between Crowe and his wife. Their estrangement seemed arbitrary, more a result of screenwriting necessity than of real life problems. By the picture's conclusion, however, this plot line was sewn up nicely.The film has a unique conclusion, which will have viewers discussing it in the lobby, in the car on the way home, and around the water cooler the next day. Some will love the ending. Most will be surprised by it, but some will not. I have mixed feelings in that while I found the final revelation to be intriguing, I wonder if it throws off the movie's delicate balance, sending it into standard thriller territory. The conclusion is not gimmicky, yet it is startling. The Sixth Sense is such a sincere and honest film that I question whether it needed that final twist.

Bruce Willis shows his talent by playing an unusually passive role and allowing focus to fall on Haley Osment's projection of despair. Haley's brilliance seems to outshine his age and reach to the level of ability far beyond that of a stereotypical child actor. Sixth doesn't fall into a specific genre, which only helps to increase its believability factor.

Had it not been for it's unarguably clever and surprising ending, it would have been fairy entertaining, by the numbers fare. But the finale does elevate it past that level. However, even with that surprise, the film felt oddly incomplete to me.The film's problem doesn't lie in it's acting. All performances are solid (although the great Olivia Williams is criminally under-used). Toni Collette was especially winning in her role as the Coles Sear's (Joey Hale Osmont) mother. The scene towards the end, when Cole shares his secret with her, it the most touching of the film. An unrecognizable Donnie Osmond gives a very brief, yet powerful performance as well. Bruce Willis and the child (whose name I may have incorrect about) are also good, but their performances are one note. Willis is believeable as the pensive, clever doctor but, with a few exceptions, never really emotes seriously. Osment's performance is perhaps the most overrated aspect of the film. I will be seeing this film again, and will try to pay more attention to him, but after my initial viewing, I wondered what all the fuss was about. True, he does a good job with the interesting character, but he never comes out of his disturbed, whispering mode.Set in Philadelphia in the fall, the atmosphere of the film is successfully bleak and eerie. The chills, when they come, are very well done and will make you jump, but they're awfully spread out (the first hour of the film, for the most part, was dull)The main distraction for me, however, was that the film aspired to be more than it really was. Willis and Osment meet for the first time, in a church. This church is used a few times throughout the film, but there really is no point to it. The spirituality of the sixth sense and of the character who has it is never explained throughout the film. Also, I wish they had elaborated more on the divorce of the boy's parents.

But really, it's just another jumble of the same old crap: cardboard characters in prefab situations, behaving as they do because the plot needs them to, not for any intrinsic reason, and not -- resolutely not -- with any underlying impulse or motivation.Aside from its laughably sophomoric spiritual pose, The Sixth Sense is also shoddily constructed. Most of the scenes are either fake and stagey, redundant, irrelevant, obvious, or all of the above, and they are edited together with the sloppiest imprecision. There is no sense of drama, mystery or anything else.Although some of the imagery is imaginative and the production design is superb, they are placed in the service of an inert, smug and witless vision, presumably that of its writer/director.

Keep in mind that this is after I've already seen Blair Witch, which was incredible (not to mention terrifying).\nThe Sixth Sense's shining star (say that 5 times fast) was Haley Joel Osment, who played a leading role as Cole Sear. This young actor is BRILLIANT. It always gets me when certain children can grasp the rules of the stage so easily. I was stunned by his incredible performance as the troubled boy, Cole Sear, who \"sees dead people\" and who is passed off as schizophrenic or delusional. He can trust no psychologist, and his paranoia has many reasons.An award-winning psychologist, however, slowly wins this boy's trust. Bruce Willis, playing Dr. Malcolm Crowe, actually surprised me in the nature of his performance. Yes, we all know Bruce Willis as the blood-and-grime-streaked action hero-- but in The Sixth Sense, he is uncharacteristically good as this very caring psychologist, who is marred by a terrible tragedy. (I cannot reveal what this is or I'd spoil an important part of the movie.)Malcolm is so dedicated to his work as a child psychologist that he begins to forget about spending time with his wife, and having a life of his own again. This may seem trite and overdone in most movies, but is a serious problem in real life and is portrayed fairly well here. Cole must convince Malcolm to help him (believing Malcolm is the only one who will be able to rid him of the ghosts) but this forces Dr. Crowe to decide between his work with Cole... or his own family.M. Night Shyamalan did well with the plot in that it hasn't been done much before, but the movie absolutely did not succeed in being scary (if that was his intent). It was so utterly obvious when something frightening was going to happen, because the music would increase in volume up until the event for somewhere around a whole minute. It wasn't even FUNNY, like in Scream. I do usually like James Newton Howard's scores; ER, The Fugitive and Flatliners are wonderful, but I guess it's not really his fault he had to do some of the things he did in Sixth Sense. This blatant, failed attempt at suspense totally brought my rating of this movie down, just because it was so overdone. There were a few tear-jerking minutes in the movie, and the ending was actually a little surprising (the ONLY suspenseful part in the movie). There's a big \"yeah, right\" factor in certain parts as well, think about it if you've seen the movie. Overall though, I'd say it was a fairly good movie, especially because of young Mr. Osment.

And I think it was realistic at how long it took for the boy to learn to trust the doctor and for how long it took the doctor to discover what was really going on.Having said all that, in addition to the pace, there were some times when I felt a little queasy, like I wasn't sure what exactly the movie was trying to say. At other times, I was caught up in it, especially in the performances of Willis and Osment.

That was as much as I had allowed myself to absorb.Osment's performance as isolated little Cole, whose only anchor is his mother, was quite touching. Osment's stillness for the camera, his prolonged moments of gravity and wide-eyed stares served as acute counterpoints to his contemporaries' careless, energetic tumblings. The lingering shots on Osment's smallest twitch and occasional tear-welling eyes allowed his talent to shine through wonderfully . He has remarkable control. I don't know if I say this in light of the fact that he's a child, or regardless of the fact that he's a child.I found Cole's relationship with his mother to be much more compelling than Cole's relationship with Malcolm Crowe (Willis). The most real moments for me were those in which Cole's mother brushes past inexplicable manifestations of Cole's affliction/curse/gift -- when she senses something out-of-the-ordinary and yet refuses to acknowledge them, perhaps because to do so would be to brand Cole as the freak that his peers accuse him of being. These moments of almost-acknowledgment made me wonder how I would react to proof of something outside of science, something that common sense tells me shouldn't be possible, shouldn't be happening, but is. This is the underlying ambition of a lot of scary movies; Sixth Sense succeeds in raising this what-if question more than any other offering in the same genre that I've seen in the last couple of years. The first instance is when Cole's mother leaves the kitchen for an instance only to return to find every single one of the kitchen drawers and cabinets opened and pulled out, and Cole sitting with his hands plastered to the kitchen table. No sound had been made in her absence; there was no way Cole could have pulled that stunt by himself, and no discernible reason for him to do so even if he could. So what could have happened? Cole's mother deflects any possibility of supernatural agents by saying, \"Baby, were you looking for something?\" To which Cole mumbles \"Pop tarts.\"On the flip side of love and protectiveness, Cole, in his turn, seeks to protect his mother from what he perceives as his curse, his freakishness. Cole's deep love and feelings of protectiveness towards his mother mirror her feelings towards him but with a much different impact coming from a young and vulnerable child. Osment's portrayal of adult responsibilities in a small, fragile package, his taking over, in a weird way, of the parenting role with his mother, made him an even more sympathetic character.Willis as Malcolm Crowe. Perhaps it's me bringing my baggage of Willis from his days in Moonlighting (tv series) and his action flicks (Die Hard, Armageddon etc.) but Willis' face is forever associated with a little half-quirk of the lips and a twinkle in the eyes, or a kick-ass frown and smirk. Willis playing the pensive psychiatrist just came across to me as wooden. It was very quiet, very still, but not very confidence-inspiring. I didn't buy Cole's gradual conversion to Crowe from his initial sprint to the church to his eventual heartfelt confessions.Having Cole come to resolution with his curse/gift through the guidance of Crowe made sense in that Cole's mother was unable to acknowledge her son's difference, but it was not altogether convincing.

Who sought vengeance on Bruce Willis, the child shrink who \"failed\" him by managing to convince him that the dead people he saw walking around all the time were merely outgrowths of stress sprouting from issues surrounding his parents' divorce? Who happened, after X years of torment by these wandering spirits, to break into Bruce Willis's house on the very night he was commended by the city for his work with children? Commended with a plaque shiny enough to have filmed the scene prior almost entirely in its reflective surface?Maybe I was. But after numerous scenes in which every line uttered by every character (and I use the term loosely) was so clearly meant to advance the plot (used even more loosely) that a kindly old narrator such as Burl Ives (or his claymation counterpart) might as well have been reading the whole movie off a clipboard, I found it difficult to sustain my disbelief. Or interest, for that matter. Yes, there were a few effective (but cheap) scares, and the ending was quite cool. But hardly a payoff worthy of having to endure a child actor as insistently bad as any I've ever seen, a mother who seemed to be peering at cue cards over her son's shoulder, and the incomprehensible stoicism of poor Bruce Willis, way out of his (fifth) element, rolling out every stupid child psychology trick save pulling a coin from behind the kid's ear (there is a coin trick, though), all of which are inexplicably and immediately effective. If only it were that easy to pull one over on the audience... oh, wait, it is. That this film has received so many positive reviews is baffling.Olivia Williams is very easy on the eyes (but has nothing to work with as obligatory wife-person), and there were some lovely ironies available, notably in the mutual confession scene in the hospital after the kid has his pseudo-seizure, but the film attempts to drive home its points like a careless carpenter with a throbbing thumb.

It is rare to find heart and Soul in any recent film, The Sixth Sense renewed my interest in going to the movies. It doesn't worry about being new, cute, breaking new effects, or splatter. The hugely positive audience response shows that well thought out ideas with fully realized character will still draw audiences in. My theatre was packed with teens the day before school resumed, they talked and giggled for awhile, but utter stillness slowly pervaded the darkness. The scares sucked us in, but the intense feelings between characters amplified that first goosebump into a lasting chill. Even if you figured out the ending, it is the precise execution that make this a killergood movie. \nI will lose faith in the Academy if they overlook Osment's amazing performance. Most child actors are only able to become a blank slate for the audience to project feeling onto--Anna Paquin in The Piano--and that is no mean achievement for actor and director.

Still, The Sixth Sense is a fine movie with plenty of psychological suspense. I liked the premise -- that the spirits of dead people can communicate with certain \"chosen\" ones among us -- and the ending is indeed totally unexpected, as I'd read on this site. The young actor who plays Cole, Haley Joel Osment, was excellent in portraying a terrified child who doesn't want the gift he was born with, and even Bruce Willis was decent (I don't usually like Willis's acting, which I think is typically one dimensional, not to mention his trade-mark smirk).

I had no idea about the twists the film would take and if you read these critiques it's unfortunate that the fact that there is a twist ending is revealed. You're better off not trying to figure it out, but instead allow yourself to be transported into young Cole's world. Lighting and color are used wonderfully to set the mood, often changing within a scene. The music, which can so often ruin a good shock by being more powerful then what's on the screen instead hightened each moment perfectly.There are some truly scary moments but this is not a horror film. It's drama with some supernatural elements, so don't be put off by a poor marketing campaign.

Indeed, the trailer didn't give a good impression of which type of movie to expect. Happily, the blend works beautifully, mostly thanks to the unbelievably mature performance of 11-year-old Osment and an amazing ending that will make you want to watch the movie all over again.The film opens with a harrowing scene that sets the tone for some of the more disturbing images to come. Successful child psychiatrist Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Willis) and his wife (Williams) are celebrating at home after he wins an award, when they are accosted by Vincent Grey (an emaciated and very frightening Wahlberg), a former patient who blames Crowe for failing to help him. The deranged Vincent first shoots Crowe in the stomach, then kills himself. Fast forward to Crowe meeting Cole Sear (Osment, best known as the son of Forrest Gump and last seen in Bogus), a young boy who suffers from the same type of \"mood disorder\" that Vincent did. Gaining the tormented child's confidence, Crowe eventually discovers that Cole thinks he is being visited by \"dead people.\" Crowe's initial skepticism gives way after he hears something strange on an old tape recording of a session with Vincent. Together, he and Cole try to discover a reason for the visitations so that Cole won't have to live in fear any more. Meanwhile, his obsession with the boy threatens to derail his marriage as his wife becomes increasingly distant.The Sixth Sense works because it plays out like a really good short story. The more dramatic moments are emotionally engaging, and humor is used to complement them. The brief scenes involving ghosts are quite creepy (thanks to their generally shocking nature and some fine makeup by Stan Winston). The characters of Cole and Crowe are well-developed, and convincingly portrayed. Willis, coming off the disappointing Mercury Rising, gives the man-helps-wunderkind premise another go, and this time he comes out a winner with an unexpectedly warm performance. Williams is used sparingly, but serves the story well. Collette is also effective as Cole's beleaguered mother. Best of all, though, is Osment. He gives Cole both the haunted maturity and wide-eyed terror needed to play a boy who is routinely subjected to horrific encounters with wronged ghosts. Given his tender age, he is almost impossibly good, certainly good enough to merit Oscar consideration. He and Willis work well together; there is a quirky chemistry between them that makes for some funny moments in the film.Director M. Night Shyamalan (whose Dickensian name somehow fits this movie perfectly) once again explores the reactions of young children to traumatic events-- basically the same territory he covered in 1998's Wide Awake (which featured a similarly adult performance by young Joseph Cross). At only 28, Shyamalan has already developed a strong style as both a writer and director. Even in the slower moments, The Sixth Sense has enough intensity to keep things interesting, and it is capped off by a twist ending that is wickedly clever without seeming contrived."}, {"rank": 143, "name": "The Sixth Sense", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Excellent in every way.

Night Shyamalan 106 minutes Rated PG-13 (for much intense material and some related gore)By Blake French:\"The Sixth Sense\" is one of the years best films. It brings together effectively and efficiently every concept of why horror films exist. So many movies these days do not live up to the promise of their genre, but \"The Sixth Sense\" does it so perfectly and convincingly that it is almost hard to tell weather this film is based on actual events or not.\n\"The Sixth Sense\" tells the story of a psychiatrist named Malcolm Crowe, who, in the film's opening, is confronted by a past client who has broke into his house waving a gun over his head screaming things like \"You lied,\" \"You did not help me\" and especially mysteriously \"Do you know why you are afraid when you're along--I do.\" He shoots Malcolm and kills himself.\nThe film then cuts to months later, where Malcolm is curious to investigate a nine year old boy, Cole Sear, who has the same rare symptoms as his patient that killed himself recently. He feels it is his duty to cure the child's illness to make up for his slacking off on the other unfortunate patient. After investigation, and some bonding between the curious Malcolm and the always terrified Cole, he discovers that the boy has a secret. One that is so personal and unbelievable Cole has never explained it to anyone, including his struggling single mother. Soon, however, Cole tells Malcolm his concealed message, \"I see dead people,\" the young boy whispers, \"they walk around like everyone else...they don't even know that they're dead,\" he explains. Naturally at first Malcolm disbelieves him, but as new evidence arrives, and issues involving his wife arise, he must choose between the one he loves or the boy he'll never forget.The story setup to \"The Sixth Sense\" is thought-out and detailed enough so that we ponder upon it and become involved. It is handled with such delicacy that even the slightest flaw would have destroyed the entire film in which its basis is held together with. Through character issues and the personal territory this film covers, we are weary about entering the character's lives; this is private area hear and it is none of our bussing what is going on inside the head of young Cole Sear. Surly some audiences will feel intimidated about learning his secret since it is so built up with a peek of high tension. The adult terror material is all in line with the film's subject matter; there is no excess violence or gore, nor is there any sub-plots that distract the story from its final message. There is some distraction in the relationship with Malcolm and his wife. But by the end, everything fits together like a perfectly pieced mind puzzle. \nThe film is not without flaws, however. Though the subplots do not sidetrack the film, a few of them do not provide enough information to serve a purpose in the plot. For instance, there is a subplot where a dead girl asks Cole to deliver a secret tape involving her death to her father. It has some revealing and emotionally on target material, but we know so little about the characters involving this story that I felt a little lost. And some particular wounds found on the bodies of the individuals inflicted with the \"sixth sense\" seem significant, but are never fully explained. At times in the movie I felt like the characters were dragging on and on, and felt myself shouting inside phrases like \"come on, get to the point.\"\nFor the most part, however, the characters pull the plot through tedious moments, like the ones I have listed. The movie has a final twist that excels beyond any other twist revealed in any other thriller I have ever seen. More perplexing than \"Entrapment.\" More jaw-dropping than \"Wild Things.\" More compelling than \"Goodbye Lover.\" And more awe inspiring than \"Arlington Road.\" It is disturbing but somehow completely believable. I am very tempted to describe the content of the final five minutes to you--but I am afraid that it is up to you to figure out. This twist is so neat that it will make you want to see the movie over again, in order to see if throughout the production the film lived up to the material. This is a very tricky ending to succeed with, but \"The Sixth Sense\" does it wonderfully.Brought to you by Hollywood Pictures."}, {"rank": 143, "name": "The Sixth Sense", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "I'll keep this short - go see it.

Bruce Willis (Pulp Fiction, Die Hard) plays the child psychologist who is trying to help him. The film is so much more than a ghost story its a well-written and subtle approach to what would be a child's worst nightmare. Bruce Willis (an underrated actor) gives a fine subdued performance. You won't be amazed by what you see, but his low-key approach to his character is exactly the way it should be played. And young Haley Joel Osment delivers a superb performance on a very difficult role especially at that young age. I might be going a bit overboard, but hopefully this performance will not be ignored when Oscar time comes around. Also, Olivia Williams (Rushmore, The Postman) as Willis's wife and Toni Collette (Velvet Goldmine, Muriel's Wedding) as Osment's mother are both great in support.

It is a horror story that eschews excessive gore and overdone special effects, and instead relies on pacing, good direction and a solid screenplay in captivating the viewer.Child actor Haley Joel Ozment and Bruce Willis are superb - Ozment as the tormented 8-year-old who sees \"dead people walking around\" and Willis in a beautifully understated role of the boy's psychologist grappling to help the child while helplessly experiencing the collapse of his own marriage.The rhythm is sometimes a bit jerky and there are a few minor plot inconsistencies. But the masterful twist at the end makes up for any shortcomings. This is one of those movies that keeps your mind employed long after you've left the theater and gone home.

Don't try to figure out what that twist might be while watching the film - you'll be wrong. While I can't site specifics of this plot twist, I can reveal that the film makers manage to cover themselves neatly in the larger sense, but where the twist falls apart is in the details. If \"A\" plus \"B\" equals \"C\" for the bulk of the film, it must also be true when the twist is revealed. Most folks, however, won't bother with the math and will be happy being told that \"A\" plus \"B\" equals \"whatever we tell you.\" Those who have seen the movie will know what I mean.Otherwise, the film is moodily shot and well-acted. Arty mood and surreal atmosphere help the film patch plot holes and are more understandable at film's end. Scene stealer of the year goes to the tot playing Cole \"Ghost\" Seer. Willis is fine as the Doc and Toni Colette (now with deluxe bee-stung lips!) ably subdues her Aussie accent to be a Philly single mom.

It wasn't even the terror it installed in me or even the pity I had for the little boy, that made me actually sick to my stomach. It was the raw emotion in the acting and the images on the screen. I just wish that I had waited and rented this movie so I wouldn't have to sit in a theatre full of people who didn't like the uncomfortable and upsetting feelings and giggled uncertainly at the little boy with the hole in the back of his head. Oh yes, America, go ahead. Laugh at the dead little boy skipping off to find his father's gun. Oh isn't he SO amusing. F**k you all. anyways . . . moving on. :)I was stunned by the beautiful and sickening (in the good way) displays of raw emotion in the movie. I had expected it to be just like \"a scary movie.\" And sure there were times that it scared the hell out of me, but most often it made me cry. The first ghost, the woman in the kitchen was by far the most effective. When she whirled around screaming \"No, dinner isn't ready yet, and you can't hurt me anymore!\" I burst into uncontrollable sobs while the guy next to me laughed confusedly. The acting was so amazing, not only with stunning performances by the boy and child psychiatrist but the dead people too. I was haunted all night by the face of the little girl crouched under her bed and by the screams of the man trapped in the room. I left the theatre with a pounding headache, a gut wrenching stomach ache and images of the dead and suffering burned into my head. I went home and wished for once that I was one of those desenstized Americans who could see someone mentally decompose and giggle. I wanted to forget the feelings that I'd had. I wanted to be able to sleep. This movie is one of the best movies I have seen.

She is marvelous at playing each of the different situations her character is challenged with, and her facial expressions ring true every time. The final scene with Lynn and Cole in the car is very touching, as Cole has often said he doesn't want his mother to see him as a freak. Willis is also good, as is Philadelphia. Wahlberg is certainly convincing. It's difficult to discuss the plot without potentially spoiling the film, so my advice would be to just see it.

And they're sufficiently creepy - real people bearing the marks of their deaths, as opposed to the translucent shapes of The Haunting. The ghost-story elements are all there, in both the actions of the spirits and their effects (the cold, the feeling of falling while standing still), lending this film much more credibility than The Haunting - ghost story fans will not be disappointed.Malcolm has his hands full trying to help Cole overcome his fear of the apparitions and try to come to terms with his ability to see them, but as a result his home life collapses as he drifts further and further from his wife. Ironically, his patient becomes the doctor, helping Malcolm to try to patch things up. The two work superbly together throughout the movie in fact.The ending, when it comes, is a complete surprise, from so far out of left field it practically skirts the foul line. I was left with my jaw in my lap as the credits rolled. The Sixth Sense stacks up as one of the best ghost movies I've ever seen, and certainly one of the best movies of the summer.

When you first see the commercials for this movie you are to assume that the ghosts the little boys sees are evil. As you watch the movie you feel that this assumption is in correct. The little boy becomes horrified by the images he is forced to watch. The ghosts all have minds of their own. These aren't the typical ghosts we are so used to seeing in films. All of them walk around not even knowing they are dead. That is what scares the little boy through out the entire film. Why I liked this film was because of its originality. Yes there have been films about people talking to ghosts. But never have we seen \"talking to ghosts\" so dark, gritty, eerie, and real as this film. For instance, the movie, Ghost, where a man dies and comes back to figure out the reason for his death and to help his love in fear of her demise as well in the process. That movie was scary in its own way but also had light hearted humor. It also had the subplot of true love. Six sense on the other hand I feel is the complete opposite from Ghost. True both movies do have the same premise. But as I said Six sense took the whole idea of talking to the dead to a different level as Ghost did. Instead of making light hearted jokes that amused you, like Ghost, it made fun of people and also made u feel bad laughing at them (example the couple buying the wedding ring). and I would also like to point out the movie did have a few faults to it, and a few holes, but overall I felt that this was a very good film and very original. It has made a very good addition to the horror genre .

I figured out the \"surprise\" ending approximately five minutes into the movie, as will anyone who has seen Adrian Lyne's film. Once you know what is coming, the ending seems somewhat hastily tacked on. This is not to say that the film is without entertainment; quite the contrary, actually.By far the best thing about the film is Haley Joel Osment. This kid is an excellent actor, and I hope he continues to find work for himself. He seems to be very natural, and when I got into the movie, I didn't notice that he was acting at all.I also loved the atmosphere of \"The Sixth Sense\". It has some genuinely creepy moments with a few good jumps thrown in for good measure. Every shot seems dark and brooding, perfectly matching the film's content.I have one major gripe, however. Maybe I'm strange, but I find it difficult to swallow when a brilliant but unsuccessful and virtually unknown film has its formula copied and \"Hollywoodized\" into a new movie that is enormously successful, but not even close to being as good. \"The Matrix\" did it to the incredible sci-fi noir \"Dark City\", and now \"The Sixth Sense\" is doing it to the vastly superior \"Jacob's Ladder\", and to an even greater extent. If you want to watch a horror film--and you simply *must* see a movie in the theatre--I would recommend \"The Sixth Sense\", as it is fine entertainment.

What is so remarkable about it is not the horror, but the tenderness and compassion permeating it. I didn't know what to expect. Yes, it was scary, but for me the chills were nothing compared to the tears.Haley Osmend's acting, as others have said, is so wonderful that you forget it's acting. He is a terrified, troubled, miserable child. But he is more. He is also intelligent, loving, and empathic. Supposed to be the patient, sometimes, despite his horrible burdens, he becomes the therapist. \nThe scene took my breath away when, after Willis has abandoned Cole with regret all around, confessing that he can't be the boy's doctor anymore because he has too many problems of his own, they meet later in the church where Cole hangs out for sanctuary, terrified of being anywhere else. His toy soldiers are lined up on the balcony rail. There is a hard edge in the boy's voice as he taunts the man who had deserted him: which of these trinkets do you want to play, or play with, today? Then suddenly he looks more closely at Willis's manner, and his own changes to concern for him: \"Something's happened to you, hasn't it?\" Such dimensions of sensitivity save both of the characters in the story, and propel their film beyond horror to greatness.I did not find the ending as surprising as some did, but it was very satisfying. If the opening scene had been in a library, panning in on a newspaper and then on a story recounting the award given to the good doctor, or an article written by him, an even more intriguing level of Jamesian conundrum might have been evoked.But I still don't get the bit about the wine cellar which he could never unlock.

Excellent performances by all, with Willis surprisingly effective and the young boy (Haley Joel Osment)'s being Oscar-caliber. A thought provoking movie with a number of good scares. While highly recommended, the movie does contain some (very few) false cheap scenes, including an early one involving a picture frame and a later one involving a videotape.For an opposite review, I would recommend the brutal (and pretty funny) review in the New York Times by Steven Holden, where he gives the movie the \"Touched by an Angel\" award for \"gaggingly mawkish supernatural kitsch\" and where he gives Willis the \"Robin Williams Award\" for \"ineffable, twinkling, half-smiling misty-eyed empathy with adorable tots.\"Interesting factoid: Toni Collette, who gives a great performance playing the young boy's mother in this film, was the overweight distraught Muriel in \"Muriel's Wedding.\" Quite an actress!"}, {"rank": 143, "name": "The Sixth Sense", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "The final 60 seconds of the movie contain a wonderfully written plot twist.

The performances all contribute ably to this atmosphere of quivering melancholy; certainly the dialogue is heavy-handed at times, and although the contrast of the kid's visions and Willis'\t personal pain is valid in thematic terms and broadly successful as melodrama, it also lends itself to a lot of portentous soul-searching and wallowing (which admittedly looks better when you think back on the thing with the hindsight of knowing where it's going).

Like Keanu Reeves in THE MATRIX, Bruce Willis brings much of his usual baggage (smirkiness and tough-guy detachment) to his role, but fares well enough for the movie to succeed brilliantly. All of the supporting cast--particularly Osment--are nearly perfect and the film as a whole hardly ever strikes a false note. The story is evocative of the best of Victorian and early 20th century supernatural fiction (think Henry James, Oliver Onions, and Algernon Blackwood, for starters), and improves on themes developed earlier by such movies as GHOST, JACOB'S LADDER, and THE SHINING. THE SIXTH SENSE never feels like a collection of cliches, however--it works with the most unsettling and archetypal elements of the ghost story within an understated, non-manipulative framework. The final twist is by no means innovative--it has been a staple of supernatural horror films over the years--but it is still surprising and emotionally satisfying. Kudos to writer/director M.

The actors/actresses were way better than I expected... (Bruce Willis in his best role yet) And the special effects/scare tactics were the most original I've seen in years.While the Blair witch uses Wavy camera and loud girly screaming to frighten the audience, the Sixth sense remains quiet and forbidding, not even letting you in on the real horror. And While slasher films use infinite Soundtracking to create a hype bigger than the budget, the sixth sense assumes the position of letting the story tell itself.Its all I can do not to spoil this movie.

Some rather glaring lapses of logic for the sake of dramatic effect: (1) When you are scared at night, you turn lights on. Screenwriter/director Shyamalan isn't skilled enough to evoke suspense without resorting to trite devices like leaving lights off, or the \"Alien\" gimmick of uncovering horrors that logic says best be left alone; (2) when your son is locked in a dark closet by two bullies, you usually say something to the bullies, you don't just walk off with your babe in your arms; (3) the first reaction of a shrink to his patient's visions isn't \"I don't see anything\" - in the real world, the response is \"What do you see?\" (4) slow pacing, again for the sake of suspense, succeeds only in making the film drag in places. Now, the good. Bruce Willis is really quite good in a quiet, sensitive role, although some of this \"sensitivity\" comes across as obtuseness.Better: the story is a wonderful \"What if\". What if we could help those who have died with unresolved issues? Unfortunately, some plot elements introduced here are left - literally - hanging, such as those poor souls on the gibbet in the schoolhouse. And, yes, a great twist ending.Best: Haley Joel Osment.

What seems like a slow beginning is actually a careful build-up to some very creepy scenes.As always, the terror of what might might be around the corner is more effective than the monster leaping out of the shadows, but here Shyalaman uses both together with a very subtle approach and an expert timing. There are actually times when we forget we're watching a scary movie, and that's when the film strikes.The fear is projected off the screen brilliantly by Haley Joel Osment in the role of the psychic child. As the only one who sees the dead people, he's the only one that can show the fear. And show it, he does! The young actor does more to portray true terror than film veterans have done in some projects.Well worth your money (even at the higher priced deluxe cinemas) and certainly worth your time.

His performance is probably the best child-actor performance I have seen in a decade. Not even in one instance, did I sense any sort of over acting from him. He truly deserves an Oscar nomination.

These films now seem \"dated\". When thinking about the thrills in \"The Sixth Sense\".I am reminded somewhat of Hitchcock as I write this on the eve of the great one's one hundredth birthday. But I think even more of a little known classic film,Roman Polanski's \"Repulsion\". In it Catherine Deneuve plays a woman who is repulsed by men. She spends a good thirty to forty minutes in virtual silence drifting into insanity, so that by the time things begin to go bump in the night the viewer is jumping out of their seat. Those who criticize the slowness of this films exposition don't seem to realize how important it is to provide the latter thrills. But almost every reviewer agrees that the ending is terrific. I gave this film an eight overall, but I will say that even though I've rated a lot of films with 9's and even 10's over the last few years, it is the only film of late that I truly plan to enjoy a second time.

This movie is more drama than horror, more heart than blood, and more thinking than scaring. The acting is effective - nice to see Bruce Willis do something other than wield a gun, and he comes across well in this; and Toni Colette, as the boy's mother, is strong in her performance as a loving, but confused parent. But the real standout in this piece is Haley Joel Osment as Cole, the little boy - now THIS kid can act!! My heart was breaking for this poor child for the whole movie . as he struggles with being considered a \"freak\" by everyone around him, so afraid to tell anyone what is really going on. While there are certainly moments that scare and surprise, I think \"horror\" and \"action\" are really the wrong words to describe this movie.

It is great to see a major Hollywood release go back to old school fright methods. Do not expect to see thrill-a-minute, falsely produced chills. This is a truly original piece of atmospheric filmmaking that earns the viewer's responses, which include frequent oohs and aahs and an occasional scream.Writer-Director M. Night Shyamalan, a Philly native, presents a plodding build-up to one of the best payoffs I have seen in a thriller in the past few years. Seeing the film, I knew the young boy (played incredibly by Haley Joel Osment) has a \"gift\" and sees certain people walking around no one else can see. Shyamalan seems to have taken a page out of Spielberg's JAWS, where the shark is never fully seen until crucial climactic scenes, and applied it to the boy's problem. It is most definitely a problem if you are interacting with people who supposedly no longer walk the earth. You may be unsure as to what he really is seeing until the great frights and charms of the picture hit you. You know when Shyamalan means for us to get it and become involved.Bruce Willis is so reserved it is scary in itself and he plays off the boy very effectively. SIXTH SENSE takes place on some other plane of existence it seems. That is how I felt. Sometimes you wonder whether people are seeing the main characters, who are all, in varying ways, mixed up in this whirlwind of terrifying sights and dimensions. It is not manipulative and the scares do not need manufacturing. We are led through them as a good script should put an audience through.Toni Collette has picked up a good South Philadelphia accent and is simply flabbergasted as to what the hell is going on with her seemingly gifted, yet sick, young son. Osment as \"Cole\", the boy star of the film outshines even Willis and shows he is capable of playing a character deeper than Forrest Gump Jr. (yep, that's him). There is a lot of religious reference to afterlife which is fitting and the so-called \"twist\" is indeed a twist to remember.All involved in this surprising production should be proud of the fact that you can still keep an audience in traction with moody story-telling and visuals and NO computer-generated effects. Compare this to the current release THE HAUNTING and realize how much better these bare bones are.Rating ***1/2"}, {"rank": 143, "name": "The Sixth Sense", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Well, it's about time a movie comes out that has more depth than the sunken Titanic. I like the direction Shyamalan (Director) takes us with this film. It is quite inventive and the subtleties are quite interesting.Bruce Willis does an excellent job in this film and Haley Joel Osment is fantastic!!..keep your eyes peeled on this boy for future performances, he is sure to be a bigger star than he is now.(WARNING:specific movie details below, you may not want to read further) [but no real plot spoilers - ed]The plot starts slow at first but then picks up to maintain a good steady pace. Some notable things that I found most interesting was the usage of the colour red. I realize white is to life as black is to death but the director utilized the use of red quite a bit in this flick. Is this to symbolize blood? Horror? or a warped sence of dark seduction? An example of this is when the boy steals the red statue out of the church. There are other ones, why take the red one. Also the red door handle going down to the cellar and the red fort the boy builds in his room. What about the redness of the lips? in one scene, the boy looks like he just finished a huge class of red Kool-Aid, so much that it looks like he has a red mustache, take a look! One last example, although there are many others to mention, is the point where Willis is sitting on the couch and Haley Joel Osment is behind the couch playing with some toys and leaves a red toy truck on the top of the couch, the next scene shows it brown. And yes, for some of you scratching your head, I was sober and not medicated at the time. Is Shyamalan playing with us?..if so, I like it.

If it had anything that would earn it an R, it would have ruined the effect.On to the actual movie. More than anything, the less you know about this movie the better, and the trailers are particularly unhelpful in this respect by giving away something that you're not supposed to immediately know (They also portray the movie as being horribly cheesy in my opinion, but hopefully in 10 years no one will remember the trailer and will remember the movie). So I won't say anything about the plot, except that I found it engaging, well paced, and well written; though to state it that way is to make it clinical in a way it really doesn't deserve.Bruce Willis and the kid both turned in great performances (Bruce Willis can really act when he has a good character), and Tak Fujimoto's cinematography was perfect. The lighting was perfectly called for, and of a style rarely seen, and the occasional use of a handheld camera was far from being the recent trendy attempts at \"realism\", but instead brought intimacy (something the movie successfully creates as a whole as well).I ended up walking out of the theater and turning to the person I saw it with and simply saying \"Grand slam.\" Why? Because it slammed me with clever fright beats? Or had witty dialog? Or a clever hook? None of these. It simply accomplished everything that it set out to accomplish perfectly, without ever seeming over the top, trying too hard, losing steam, or relying on effects.

Actually, all actors need more scripts like this one. This is Willis' best performance since \"In Country\" in 1989.Eleven-year-old Haley Joel Osment as vision-haunted Cole Sear is the real thing. For those who resist movies with \"kids\" in them, remember Patty Duke in the original Miracle Worker. This Oscar caliber performance merits a Best Actor nomination . not Best Supporting Actor.

People may remember that when Willis did that movie they did not think he would be able to pull it off because they were so used to the character he played in Moonlighting. Well, I'm sure that by now most people will admit that he can handle an action movie with no problem. But keeping in mind that people didn't think he could do it back then, why are people surprised to now see him playing a more intelligent role (ala Moonlighting)?Willis' portrayal of \"Dr. Malcomb Crowe\" was flawless. With a depth of character rarely seen by \"action movie actors\", Willis manages to be a fully believable \"average guy\" in The Sixth Sense, giving what may be his finest performance to date. Accepting this role may surprise people as much as Mel Gibson playing Hamlet, but he plays the part with no less style or skill than Gibson used in the Shakespearian classic.Having said that, Willis does NOT put on the best performance in this movie. (Sorry Bruce) Haley Joel Osment, who plays Cole Sear, is astounding. Child Actors do not typically have the experience to play the role of someone as psychologically disturbed as Cole. Not so in this case. Haley makes you believe that he has experienced everything his character has with every tear shed and look of horror on his face. If there was ever an actor who deserved recognition in the form of an Oscar, Osment is in the running.Some critics claim the movie is slow moving, and in a way it is. At least if you can consider starting a movie with a madman breaking into the house and shooting the leading man in the gut as \"slow moving\". The Sixth Sense is not as fast paced as some movies, but in that is much of the movie's appeal. Since it is less \"in-your-face\" than your typical horror/thriller it has a much better chance to get \"in-your-mind\". And getting in your mind is what this movie is all about.In an era where horror movies are all about high budget special effects and large gnashing teeth, The Sixth Sense is very subdued. You are lulled into complacency and then brought to the edge without a moments warning, and all with a class and style that lets you know the Hitchcock style of film making is still very much alive.This movie wraps itself up neatly with a plot twist to make the writers and producers of The Game green with envy.

I am now approaching 46. I have seen a great deal of death and horror, both fictional and real. Most fiction does not get much out of me, not a shudder, not a chill.Until I saw \"The Sixth Sense\" (TSS), my favorite ghost story was \"The Haunting\", the 1963 version. It was followed by \"Jacob's Ladder\". \"TSS\" now is in first place.This story is filled with pain and compassion, kindness and fear, and failure and redemption. This is a lot to get from a ghost story. And in the end, it all makes sense.Bruce Willis as the psychologist, and Haley Joel Osment, as the troubled child have a wonderful chemistry. You believe they desperately wish to work with each other towards ending the child's torment. Furthermore, the terror and emotional pain the child displays is totally believable. This is what gives this movie the power it possess. When an emotional foundation is built, one does not require special effects and blood to engage us.I heard the audience around me gasp at some of the scarier moments. Personally, I had the hair on my arms and the back of my neck raise. For a jaded cynic like me, this seldom happens.If you have a weak heart or have religious convictions which would interfere with your enjoyment of a ghost story, do not see this movie.

It's one of the few movies I've watched lately and then realized it had no plot holes that I could find. I thought I found one at first, but realized it was merely a case of seeing what I expected to see rather than what was actually shown.At one point, Cole comments that the ghosts can't see each other, they only see what they want to see. The ending makes the same point TO the audience ABOUT the audience, and does it with a demonstration that cannot be argued against.The writing, direction, and acting are all great... I knew Willis could act, but I was surprised to see than Donnie Wahlberg (that's right, from the New Kids On The Block) can do some impressive acting, as well--at least in the brief appearance he makes as a former patient.There's one scene in particular where surprisingly good acting from a child combines with brilliant direction to allow you to see exactly how Cole feels having to go to the bathroom alone in the middle of the night, knowing that the dead will appear, but knowing when or how... I've never seen a movie convey emotion this way before.You really should see this--not to be scared (which you will be, suddenly and with no warning, at various points in the movie), but to be made to THINK, in the way that good science fiction makes you think."}, {"rank": 143, "name": "The Sixth Sense", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "I, like many others, have been a little disappointed with the summer 1999 movie season.

Luckily, this movie managed to be great despite this. Writer/Director M. Night Shyamalan gets his vision across. Bruce Willis shows he hasn't forgotten how to act in a movie that isn't all one liners and explosions. The supporting cast, including an unrecognizable Donnie Wahlberg, are top rate. The most impressive thing about this movie was Haley Joel Osment. This young actor made me believe he was living with this torment. It is a nice change of pace to see a young actor who isn't just a cute face on the screen. This young man can act, far out classing any one else in the movie. I look forward to more from him.

Well, I suppose for the MTV-addled, or those who think that this is another Bruce Willis \"blow up everything in sight\" movie, they will be unsure what to do with a film that owes more to Hitchcock's sense of timing and build-up than Jan DeBont.This film does what so few seem to and that is they give their audience credit for having a brain. There are a million little details and many of them don't appear until after you've seen the film and are discussing it with a friend afterward.

The cameras filmed shots that were unnecessary and unusually dramatic, successfully giving the film it's dark and eerie feel. Simply artistic! The camera work is a great example of how much genius went into this movie.And the acting!! Incredible! Powerful! I have never seen a better child actor. He was so believable and so real that he alone makes the movie what it is, taking the audience to depths of fear, despair, anger, and even joy. Bruce Willis also did a great job in a different kind of role then what I'm use to seeing him in.The movie was so unpredictable, I found myself gaping. I thought I was in for a reasonably scary horror movie, but it was much more than that. Though it started slow at first (with excellent character development), toward the end it picked up. In one moment of the movie, I was uneasy. In another, I actually screamed and jumped out of my seat.

You can almost see the pitch for this one, \"its like 'Ghost' meets 'Little Man Tate,' with just a little bit of 'Seven's' atmospherics thrown in for color. Sadly, the film's melange does not live up to even one of its parent films (with the exception of maybe the worst moments of 'Ghost').This film is a testament to the dullness of the American thriller at the moment. The ghosts in the film are about as terrifying as the homeless people you'd see on a trip to New York, the tone of the film is unjustly gloomy, and the plot is so formulaic that, in instances, you can see its chemical symbols peeking through.

How often does a movie come out that takes a long-established and even cliched genre and turn it on its ear? I can think of only a few in the last two decades, including \"Pulp Fiction\" which changed how we look at crime films and \"Die Hard\" which did the same for action films. Well, \"The Sixth Sense\" is one of these rare movies, and it will change how you look at ghost stories forever. (And, interestingly enough, Bruce Willis is in all three of these films! Weird, huh?) I won't reveal much of the plot here, since the less you know about the film going in, the better. But I will say that it involves ghosts; the film has a clearly defined idea of what a ghost is, exactly, and that idea is crucial to the plot of the film... which involves the relationship between a child psychologist (Willis) and a little boy who has a very big problem. \"The Sixth Sense\" is slowly and deliberately paced (though never boring), is filled with both heart-breaking moments and knowing humor, reveals plot through character development and subtle directing instead of through heavy-handed manipulation of the audience like most horror films, and manages to horrify without dumb \"shock\"-moments and a minimum of gore. The acting by everyone here is uniformly superb, especially by Haley Joel Osment, a child-actor who plays the main character and who is dead-on perfect in scene after scene after scene. The quiet moments between him and an equally superb Bruce Willis are beautifully written, funny, sad, quirky and original.

The summer of 99 has produced 2 very intensely creepy films. First Blair Witch takes us all by storm and now the Sixth Sense does the same thing. What we have here is a film that does all the things that a \"horror\" film should do. It uses shadows, it has talk of the dead and the undead and it even uses other things like atmosphere and music to produce a very good scary film, and one that will have you buzzing about the ending.Young Cole can hear and see dead people and it is up to Dr. Malcolm to help him out. The story itself is interesting and how it is carried out is even better. But I have to say that I think this is a film that should be seen twice to figure everything out and to understand all that it is. Because when you leave the theater you will question many aspects of the film. You will wonder if it is legitimate in it's approach and honest and realistic with what the end of the film has wants us to believe. But when I walked home and had a chance to examine it, I realized how truthful it is, and that makes it even more brilliant. And in a way this film reminds me of a 1987 film called Angel Heart. Both films concentrate on foreshadowing and they also play with our intellect. When I first saw Angel Heart, I knew that it was good, but when I began to watch it more often on video, I realized that Angel Heart was a film that had more to it in every shot. Every single time the camera rolled, there was always a subliminal meaning behind the ersatz one that was in front of us. And that is what I think Sixth Sense does so well. You wonder at first why Malcolm can't get into his basement, and then when you leave the theater and think about the film, you realize how much it all made sense. This is a film that manipulates our psyche and plays with our ethos. But it has a great time doing so. I highly recommend this film, especially if you want to be frightened. There are about five or six really good moments in the film that make your heart stop. And on that level the film is terrific.

Cinematography was solid and considering Tak was behind the camera, it doesn't surprise me. Young Osmet actually appeared to put some thought into his acting. Most child actors appear to be nothing more than parrots for the director, mimicking the commands of the script but not having the experience or emotional base from which to truly act the scene. Not in this case. Haley Osmet did a wonderful job making his character emote. Have seen most of the better films of the year and so far this one captured me more than any of the others. I really truly believe that to honestly experience a good film you must go into the theater weaponless, bring nothing but what you are, your life experiences. Otherwise, the experience always becomes something that was preconceived and you guard yourself from participating in the story. This one rattled the chains of my fathers death while I watched it. Anybody who has had someone close to them pass on will connect to this film in varying degrees. Things left undone and unsaid and so on. It is a tender and meticulously, well thought out story and it *will* get you in the end. Go see it and try to honestly find anything wrong with it. Some of you may be able to pick out the plot early but it shouldn't disrupt your enjoying the film. Doesn't depend on overwhelming buckets 'O' blood or viscous, needless cursing and people lathering each other with their tongues or computer generated whiz-bangs.

One is the Blair Witch Project; the other is The Sixth Sense.The horror genre has been mired for some time in the baroque self-indulgence of superficial and ornamental special effects. The Blair Witch Project has come along like the cinematic equivalent of punk rock---stripping away the self-indulgence to help rediscover the elemental core of the genre.The Sixth Sense is quite another matter entirely: it is quite simply a great pop movie----deeply felt, humanistic---and almost certain to be overlooked and underestimated. It is a movie that uses the conventions of the horror genre, but bends them to its own purposes. Like the movie ET, which taught us that not all aliens are unfriendly invaders, and in so doing, liberated the alien/sci fi genre.......so to The Sixth Sense steadfastly refuses to view the spirit world as some adolescent frat-party of frights. Instead, it reacquaints us with the age-old lore that tells us that the dead shall walk the earth as long as their spirits are troubled. The dead do not haunt the earth, and our memories, just to scare us---but because they want something from us, some grace note that gives their lives meaning, and settles old hurts and misunderstandings, but not in the immature and vengeful way that the horror genre had descended into. And we the living want something from the deceased who have left us: we want them to be proud of us, to give us their blessing. And so this movie, incredibly enough for a movie that plays almost straight with the conventions of the horror genre, is a subtle meditation about love and connectedness and relationships, between the living, and between the living and the dead. It is a movie about redemption. And one thing it helps to redeem is the genre that it arises from."}, {"rank": 143, "name": "The Sixth Sense", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Without spoilers, I am not sure that you can guess the ending of this movie.

M. Night Shyamalan wrote and directed The Sixth Sense, and it is so carefully constructed in every respect that it creates a world with its own natural laws, in the way that Hitchcock's or Ford's films do. Every cast member is in perfect tune with the director's mission here. Bruce Willis, Toni Collette and Olivia Williams play each role beautifully, in service to Shyamalan's story. Haley Joel Osment, as the psychic child Cole, and Donnie Wahlberg, as a homicidal psychotic, deliver two of the years' most powerful performances.This is another of those films about which the less said about plot, the better. Suffice to say there are thrills and chills but no gratuitous violence of any kind. This may be one of the least melodramatic \"ghost\" pictures in the history of cinema. In tone, it's closer to a movie like \"Little Man Tate\" than to other horror films which feature children, such as \"The Shining\" or \"Poltergiest\".

It is chilling and effective at certain times, puzzling in others.Bruce Willis plays Malcolm Crowe, a renown child psychologist who, after an encounter with an ex-patient who he couldn't help, is left mentally scarred and finds the world around him falling apart. He takes on a quiet and alienated young boy named Cole, whom he tries to succeed in reaching him where others have failed. Young Cole is branded a freak by his schoolmates, and everyone believes that his sense of isolation and paranoia is self-imposed, and brought on by his parent's divorce. Willis treats his case in much the same manner at first, but when he admits the truth to him, things start getting really weird. Apparently Cole is gifted in ways few would imagine, he has the ability to see and talk to the spirits dead people. And it is not just the recently dead, he can see deaths that took place many years before. In one scene, his teacher is quizing him on the history of the school, and he casually mentions \"They used to hang people here\", drawing many puzzled stares from his classmates. When the subtitle on the poster says \"Not Every Gift Is A Blessing\", they mean just that, this turns Cole into a nervous wreck, and he becomes increasingly paranoid as the film progresses. All he knows is that the ghosts won't leave him alone, and they want something from him. Willis soon becomes a believer, and he tries to help him in whatever way he can, while putting on the back burner everything else, including the relationship with his wife.I wouldn't dare give away the ending, except to say that it defies all logic. It will leave you asking many questions as you think back to instances earlier in the movie. For the casual moviegoer, it will give you a lot to talk about after the movie is over.\"The Sixth Sense\" is flawless in terms of acting. Bruce Willis is very watchable, as always, and he turns in the caring, big-brotherly performance he failed to give in last year's mediocre \"Mercury Rising\". I have always liked Bruce Willis in whatever he did, even if everything else about the movie was bad. It is a good role for him. Young Haley Joel Osment is superb as Cole, and he plays with a perfect sense of timing and depth. He is incredibly believable in his role, and he has turned in what could quite possibly be the best performance from a child actor I have ever seen.Overall, this is a good movie. It has the perfect mix of supernatural thriller and drama, with more emphasis on the chemistry between Willis and Osment rather than distracting the audience with special effects for two hours. It is not a prefect movie, but it makes for one of the summer's most satisfying moviegoing experiences. 8/10"}, {"rank": 143, "name": "The Sixth Sense", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Several reviewers noted that there was a \"surprise\" ending that changed the whole tone of the film.

Night Shyamalan knew just what to do with this movie (considering he wrote it) to make the audience really WANT to see it a second time. The ingenious surprise ending will make viewers want to come back and watch the movie again with the knowledge of the ending. Shyamalan's choice of camera angles is subtle, with a slight reminder of the angled view of Mission: Impossible. He also used James Newton Howard's eerie yet inviting score to entrance the viewers. Shyamalan uses his directorial touches to make this movie a true work of art. 2) Haley Joel Osment delivers the most powerful performance I've seen out of a young actor in a good long while. He is reminiscent of Justin Henry of Kramer v. Kramer. His natural naivety makes the audience really tune into his character. (After seeing this movie, I'll bet George Lucas kicked himself.)I'm sure the Academy will recognize the hard work of such a bright young star. He has quite a future ahead of him.

I didn't even feel it was supposed to be scary except for the occasional cheap scare of someone jumping out of nowhere or the music suddenly appearing with enormous intensity. It was just that that world was somehow different than ours - visually.I thought the acting was terrific. Bruce Willis has never been better. For a while, I even stopped thinking that he was John McClane. He was simply a child psychologist trying to help a troubled kid. The kid, by the way, was fantastic. He is possibly the best child actor/actress since Tatum O'Neil was in Paper Moon. This kid should have been Anakin in the Phantom Menace instead of Jake \"Can't Act His Way Out Of A Paper Bag\" Lloyd; but I don't want to get into that. This kid ran the gamut of emotions - fear, isolation, happiness, sadness, and confusion. He is a better actor than most adults in the SAG.I was also a fan of the ending. That truly made the movie for me. The writer must have gone to the Cabinet of Dr. Caligari school of screenwriting. It was (POTENTIAL SPOILER) a brilliant plot twist - the best since The Usual Suspects.When it comes down to it, the movie really knew what to do with emotions. The audience can really feel for the mother. She loved her son, but she didn't know what was going on with him. She didn't know what she could do for him; I'm sure a lot of parents have felt that way. Scratch that - I'm sure a lot of people have felt that way. Not only can we feel for the mother, but I felt bad for the kid. Quite frankly, his gift sucks; you can really feel for him.

Not as hyped as the other `scary' movies released this summer, it ends up being scarier and better. The Sixth Sense is not juts a scary movie, it is a psychological thriller. It is a work of art. It is compassionate and appealing and takes over your senses in a slow hypnotic way. Not what you would expect from a movie that has Bruce Willis listed as the main star. Fortunately, this movie is in no way like other Bruce Willis films.I will tell you a little about the story, which is ideally all you need to know prior to seeing the film, just a little. Bruce Willis is Malcolm Crowe, an award winning psychiatrist whom almost a year after a traumatizing event takes on a boy with similar problems of another boy he tried to help but could not. Haley Joel Osment plays Cole, the little boy who is deeply troubled and withdrawn no one knows why. Except, of course, for us, who already know from the ads and commercials for this film that he `sees dead people'. Cole lives with his divorced mother, played by Lynn Collette.Director M. Night Shyamalan has directed this movie in a quiet slow Hitchcockian way that works to its benefit, especially amidst complaints that the film drags. It is a very carefully weaved story that creates an interest that compels you to watch every part. The acting is excellent, particularly that of Haley Joel Osment. His painful and anguished expressions from the terror he feels just tear into your heart. The strained relationship between the scared boy and his single, loving and caring mother is also touching as well. Willis is great as the sad, concerned, and frustrated psychologist, bent on saving the boy, so that he may save his career and his marriage. The dark twists and the commentaries on death and loss make this movie extremely touching and there are scenes in which there are very few dry eyes in the theater, something not expected from a horror/ thriller. And this movie does not over do it in its horror; it remains classy and subtle, yet shocking. You will jump in your seat at least twice, which is once more than I did at The Haunting.This movie is slow at first, but it builds up a great story, superb acting, good scares, and pulls at the heartstrings when you least expect it. The ending is an all out shocker, and makes the movie. I will not predict Oscars for this film, but I will say it is definitely the best movie of the Summer Film Season, and one of the best movies of the year. Definitely one of my Top Ten movies of all time. Give it a shot."}, {"rank": 143, "name": "The Sixth Sense", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "In an industry awash with cheesy horror flicks and unthrilling thrillers, few dare attempt combining the two genres, and even fewer succeed. But The Sixth Sense dares\u0085and succeeds. The film never succumbs to the pitfalls of either genre; at no point does the dialogue prove dense or the acting plastic. Written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan (Wide Awake), The Sixth Sense is both bone-chillingly frightening and touching and maintains composure throughout.Bruce Willis plays Malcolm Crane, a confident child psychologist who has recently received a reward for his dedication to the field. On the evening he and his wife (played by Olivia Williams, Rushmore) are celebrating the honor, a former patient (played by a well-disguised Donnie Wahlberg) of Crowe's breaks into his home. After an emotional, catatonic outburst in which he condemns Crowe for being unable to heal his emotional pain, the patient pulls a gun. Crowe is shot. Without further explanation, the film moves forward to \"The Next Fall\" (as a subtitle reads). Quickly, we realize that Crowe has changed. Distraught over the failure to help his former patient, Crowe is eager to take on a young boy named Cole Sear, (played by Haley Joel Osment) who exhibits similar symptoms, in hopes of reclaiming faith in his abilities. Although Cole initially feels that Crowe is incapable of providing a solution, he eventually accepts the doctor's open hand. As their relationship grows, Cole, who is rejected by his classmates and is even called a freak by his own teacher, gradually feels comfortable enough to reveal his secret: he sees dead people, everywhere and all the time. Although Willis refutes the idea of otherworldly communication, he is determined to aid the boy. Crowe's study progresses, and we see just how capable Willis is of performing serious roles. He adeptly portrays a man torn between his urgency to repair the failures of his past and the need to restore his crumbling marriage (caused by the very dedication to his work for which he was rewarded), all with an odd, melancholic irk that fits the character completely. The real star of the feature; however, is Haley Joel Osment, whose precocious acting is honest, centered, and convincing-qualities rarely seen or expecting from children his age. Osment truly convinced me that he was a child tortured by the ghastly apparitions of the dead and by his vicious, cold-hearted peers who issue constant torment. Looking back on the film, I'm honestly not sure what would be worse-seeing the dead or being completely shunned by the living. Nonetheless, Osment's skill is evinced in every petrified facial expression, in every cringe of anguish, and in every eye that wells with tear. I'm anxious to see what the future holds for this bright star.The analogy between the struggles of Crowe (torn between his work and his personal life) and Cole (tormented by both the living and the dead) constructs the framework that supports their relationship, and is the crux of the film's story (which becomes clearer near the film's end). Shymalan juggles both central characters along with the impressive supporting cast, and he maintains firm control of every one, even though the story falters slightly at times. But let us not forget the other strength of this film: it is creepy, and it will make you jump from the securityof your seat. Although the gore feels excessive for a PG-13 rating and often seems present only to act as a crutch for the film's snail-like pace, it is quite effective at coercing the hair from one's neck and the warmth from one's skin.The Sixth Sense succeeds in frightening its audience. But, more importantly, the film achieves the lofty goal of presenting a solid, thrilling story about the struggles between life and death, overshadowed by a strong message of compassion and acceptance. If you seek a scare with a good story to support it, The Sixth Sense will provide, and the ending will truly blindside you (it's quite a surprise, and it doesn't leave any plot holes that allow arguments along the lines of \"that could have never happened if\u0085\"). And if you're anything like me, this film will haunt you for days, creeping its way back into your mind like a slow tide on a darkened beach."}, {"rank": 143, "name": "The Sixth Sense", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "It was pretty good while watching, and then there is an excellent ending that pulls the entire movie together, and then the more you think about it, the better it gets in your mind.

What remains is a well-crafted script attached to a remarkable film. This movie is genuinely frightening, in ways that I haven't seen in years.The plot is quite simple on the surface. Bruce Willis plays a troubled psychologist who has difficulty communicating with his wife. He takes on the case of a child who is frightened by something mysterious and who also resembles a case that went horribly wrong, resulting in a break-in and a shooting.When the little boy tells Willis that he can see dead people, the movie becomes remarkably chilling. It is a sort of thrill ride without a hack-and-slash plot, leading up to a surprise climax that is worthy of written speculative fiction. All of the leads perform marvellously, and are truly convincing.Perhaps the only flaw is that once the surprise twist has become known, several fairly large plot holes arise as one thinks back on the film. However, this is a remarkable enough film that they do not detract horribly from the experience.Definitely worth seeing, and worth the money for admission. 4/5."}, {"rank": 143, "name": "The Sixth Sense", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "\"The Sixth Sense\"When Bruce Willis decides to act, it's an important occasion. When slogging through misfires like \"Mercury Rising\" and pure junk like \"Armageddon\", Willis never gets a chance to show the more dramatic side to his personality. \"Sixth Sense\" is the first product of the new Willis-no-guns philosophy that Bruce recently has made public. While it aspires to be \"The Exorcist\" for 1999, \"Sixth Sense\" can only muster the atmosphere of an off episode of \"X-Files\". A downright incomprehensible thriller that is too concerned with mood to care about the laughable story.The real star of the picture is young Haley Joel Osmet (the easy bio is to say Forrest Jr. in \"Forrest Gump\"). He plays a young boy named Cole who has the ability to see the dead. The life-challenged repeatedly harass and torture him to a point when the entire world the surrounds Cole views him as a freak. While his mother (gifted Toni Collett) cannot understand the secrets Cole keeps, a child psychiatrist (Willis) finds himself drawn to help the young child. The two set out to crack the mystery of why Cole is the chosen one.Written and directed by first-timer M. Night Shyamalan, the film has all the trappings of a debut movie. It's careful with every detail, visually flat, and has trouble sustaining interest throughout. What the film does just right is creating some creepy moments. Moments that could have forced the film to take a more disturbing note, thereby making the movie memorable. What Shyamalan does is punctuate each heightened situation with a orchestral bang or any other Dolby scare tactic used by every modern film to grab a scare. I keep wondering why directors do this. Sure, it gets a jolt out of the audience, but it's an easy one that isn't earned. A real horror film shouldn't have to lower itself to get a fright out of the audience. In the end, \"Dolby scares\" do more harm than good. \"Sixth Sense\" had the goods to really disrupt the audience, instead it hits all the same notes.Bruce Willis swearing off action films might be the worst mistake Willis has made. His best work has been in this genre (the \"Die Hard\" series) and giving it up leaves him with a plethora of father and psychiatrist roles to play for the rest of his career. We meet a kinder, gentler Willis in \"Sixth Sense\". It's a performance that isn't among the actor's best, yet is far from an embarrassment. Willis plays his character rather muted, never once opening up for the big emotions. You could say that was his character, but I suggest that Willis just doesn't know how to play anyone who doesn't have an urgent situation to take care of. I love Willis, but \"Sixth Sense\" doesn't require much from the actor except pursed lips and a really obnoxious hairpiece. Ten year old Haley Joel Osment, on the other hand, has a remarkable depth and range for a child his age. It is his acting that grounds \"Sense\" emotionally. I enjoyed his work here very much, and a simple scene of mother and son bonding in a shopping cart clearly showed the chemistry Osment shared with on-screen mom Collett.A victim of crass Disney mismarketing, \"Sixth Sense\" isn't really much more than a light thriller with demonic overtones. Shyamalan's script often goes on wild tangents. Scenes with Willis and his wife (shockingly unused Olivia Williams, seen last in \"Rushmore\") that are supposed to pay off at the end of the picture are left wide open for questions dealing with simple logic. Another moment in which Osment helps a little dead girl to justice seems from a different movie. The entire film appears to make little sense, yet to question what you're watching is obviously not the point. Shamalyan's script is also without dialog, just characters delivering speeches to each other. It's all tiring after an hour or so.Like this summer's \"Arlington Road\", the entire film hinges on a last minute plot twist. A twist that is supposed to knock you off your feet. While I was surprised by the ending, it's such an illogical and implausible plot turn that it's hard not to laugh at it. Coming out of the film I was disappointed in the PG-13 \"Sense\". The next film to try this plot (Scorsese's next, \"Bringing Out The Dead\", features a similar idea) should just try to take the material more seriously, give it a chance to creep us out instead of forcing it. \"Sixth Sense\" is just another forgettable thriller.---------- 3"}, {"rank": 143, "name": "The Sixth Sense", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "As the president of a ghost research team, I'm always looking for \"good\" ghost movies.

They'll usually start with a grisly murder, or something that foreshadows the many grisly murders that will occur during the movie. Though this formula can sometimes be effective, it gets old and sour faster than you can scream bloody murder.The Sixth Sense, however, defies all the conventional horror rules. Instead of putting together a series of unlikely events that ends up as a bloodbath at the end, it slowly draws the audience into its web of mystery and thrills. Though it does start with an event that foreshadows events in the movie, it does it in a way that nobody will expect. In a tense yet nuanced style, it keeps you enthralled in the plotline while finally blowing you away at the end.The performances are Oscar-caliber, at least by 11 year old actor Haley Joel Osment.

Bruce Willis is at his best since Die Hard and The Last Boy Scout. His patient is 33 years junior to him ( played by Haley Joel Osment) is outstanding. Truly. I was mesmerized by his ability to get into this \"sixth sense\" possessed character. Malcolm and Cole helping each other resolve their problems occurs with good chemistry, and is believable, despite the heights you have to take your mind to believe the story's premise. I am sooo tempted to give clues on when to grip the one you're with or arms rests a little more tightly; but alas, cannot in good conscience (or for fear of hate mail!) And out of respect for M.

As child psychologist Dr. Malcolm Crowe, Willis reminds us not only can he act, but that he's capable of subdued, highly nuanced and genuinely emotive performances.Written and directed by expatriate Indian M. Night Shyamalan (Praying With Anger [1992]; Wide Awake [1998]; and writer of the upcoming Stuart Little), The Sixth Sense is an old-fashioned, understated supernaturally-themed psychological thriller in the Val Lewton tradition. Recovering from the violent trauma of a home invasion by a former patient, Dr. Crowe is struggling to put his life back together when he takes on a new, literally haunted patient, Cole Sear (the impressive Haley Joel Osment, perhaps best remembered as portraying Forrest Junior in Forrest Gump). Withdrawn and mistrusting, seemingly as a result of his parents' divorce, Cole's fears are not the work of an overactive, disturbed imagination as Crowe surmises, but are tangible. Cole sees dead people, spirits who have failed to realize they are ghosts and whom continually relive their last, painful moments. Since his mother (a strong performance by Toni Collette, from Velvet Goldmine and Emma) and everyone else treats him as a freak, Cole is naturally wary of revealing his secret to Crowe, but the developing relationship leads man and boy into new avenues of self-discovery.To reveal more of The Sixth Sense's plot would do the film a disservice (beware reviews by critics who are notorious for spoilers such as Entertainment Weekly's Owen Gleiberman and Lisa Schwarzbaum). Like Dr. Crowe, audiences should approach this movie with an open mind and be prepared to take a slow, measured journey into the unknown. In fact, the film's thoughtful pace may pose a problem for audiences weaned on MTV-paced quick cutting and big budget flash. However, the preview audience with which I saw the movie was composed in part by families with children, and even the hyper-active six year old seated behind me was enthralled by the story. Not one preteen voice was heard throughout the running time, and both parents and kids looked shaken on leaving the theater.Acknowledgement should also be made to Tak Fujimoto [The Silence of the Lambs] for his discreet cinematography which, by using a muted palate of dark browns, washed out grays, and natural low level lighting, perfectly captures the melancholy texture of Philadelphia in the fall.Forget Jan De Bont's folly and the hype surrounding the amateur, home movie boredom of The Blair Witch Project. The Sixth Sense is the kind of chilling film Robert Wise or Jacques Tourneur would have made were they still working today.Not to be missed.Philip Nutman"}, {"rank": 143, "name": "The Sixth Sense", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Sometime Bruce Willis can make some bad films, like HUDSON HAWK and MERCURY RISING. And other times he can make some films that change the film industry and blow the audiences away (i.e. DIE HARD triology, 12 MONKEYS, and PULP FICTION). Now Willis' new film, THE 6th SENSE falls in the latter catageory, as a surprising masterpiece that will leave images stuck in your mind for quite sometime. Willis plays Malcolm Crowe, a child psychologist, who is quite good at his job, he has a loving wife named Anna (played by the beautiful Olivia Williams), and he just got awarded by the mayor of Philadelpia for his excellent work. Then one night, Malcolm gets a terrifying unexpected visit from one of his former patients. The visit is so terrifying, that it haunts Malcolm later on. Months later, Malcolm's job is going downhill, and his marriage is falling apart. Then his life is changed around when he meets Cole, a eight year old boy who is considered a \"freak\" by everybody but his mom. Cole is usually alone, scared, and has cuts and bruses on his body. The doctors and social workers think the injuries come from his mom, Lynn Sear (Toni Collette). But Lynn loves Cole too much that she wouldn't even think of harming him. The truth is that the injuries that Cole has are from other people, people that Cole only sees, people that are dead. Cole sees dead people walking around with the living, and only Cole sees these ghostly figures. Malcolm tries to help Cole with his unique gift, and to also find out what these ghostly figures want with him. When I saw the trailers for this movie, it looked like a o.k. movie. Acutally, the preview didn't have any effect on me at all, as for seeing this film. But when I saw this film, I was blown away on how excellent this was! This is a highly entertaining film that is scary, sad, funny, and even touching. The plot is brilliant, it has intellegence, and shows the personalities of the characters well enough that you feel like that you know them after the movie is over. The acting is also great, Willis does a good job as the doctor trying to help poor Cole. Toni Collette is also great as the suffering mom who's very worried and protective over Cole. Oliva Williams is good as well as the suffering wife of the doctor who feels that she's losing her husband more and more everyday. But the real surprise is Haley Joel Osment, who plays the little boy, Cole. For a child actor he's excellent! He shows potential to becomming a great actor in years to come. He's the next promising child actor that will hopefully do well like Elija Wood and Anna Panquin. Overall, THE 6th SENSE took me by surprised, and I ended up loving this film. I would have to place this film as one of the best films of the year, as well as for the summer films. And for a PG13 rated film, it's quite scary!

This is the \"gift\" that 8-year-old Cole (Haley Joel Osmont) must deal with every waking moment, never knowing what disfigured spectre will cross his path next. His teachers think he's dysfunctional, his classmates call him a freak and his mother doesn't know what to make of him. Enter Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis), eminent child psychologist (Bruce Willis) who sees Cole as a chance to redeem himself for perceived past failures. First let me state that the advertising for this movie is somewhat misleading as this isn't a horror movie in the classic sense. Given the premise it may sound strange to say that, but the bulk of the movie is spent trying to make us understand Cole's situation rather than trying to scare us every thirty seconds. That said, there are some very good scares.Osmont does an excellent job as the troubled Cole, showing maturity beyond his years - he conveys the terror of his situation without being melodramatic (if only he'd been available for Phantom Menace\u0085). Expect to see a lot more of him in the future. It was also nice to see Willis given a chance to display his acting talents for a change, rather than just blowing things up (not that I don't enjoy that as well). Maybe this will finally give Willis some well deserved credibility and more challenging roles in the future.Finally, although this movie does not exactly keep up a blistering pace, it had one of the best surprises I've seen since \"No Way Out\".Enjoy."}, {"rank": 143, "name": "The Sixth Sense", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "I saw a sneak preview on Friday night, and I must say this is the best work I've ever seen Bruce Willis do.

I'd only had the trailer to go on to know what to expect, and besides thinking that trailer suffers from the \u0091give-too-much-away-itis' that most trailers seem to suffer from these days, I had little clue what to expect. I'd never seen any of M. Night Shyamalan's work, never saw Toni Collette in anything and only had Rushmore to go on in knowing Olivia Williams, so I can tell you I was pleasantly surprised by what I saw tonight. Shyamalan has written a corker of a script, stylish and lean, and his direction is truly remarkable. The pacing may make some impatient gonzos squirm (as it did with the moron behind me who kept muttering back to the screen), but this is no cheap-scare-a-minute wild-cutting frightfest. Instead, we get a moody, creepy and suspenseful masterwork, with a gripping story and great, great performances from the whole cast. Toni Collette and Olivia Williams are excellent, but it is Willis and Haley Joel Osment (Forrest Gump Jr.) that are the backbone of this film, and their work is incredible. Will you be frightened? Yes. Are there scary moments? Yes. Are there any gross-out ghoulies jumping out at you or outrageous FX to make you realize that \u0091this is the scary part and I'm supposed to scream now?' Most definitely not. What you do get is a convincing and unnerving film that crawls under your skin and waits for the right moment to grab you. Shyamalan is a talent to watch out for, and Willis continues to amaze me with his keen eye for odd projects that turn out to be fantastic movies. Can't wait to see it again.

He actually is pretty good in it too! An ode to such great 70's thrillers as Roeg's Don't Look Now and Friedkin's The Exorcist, this film is moody, disturbing and visually fascinating. Using all forms of symbolism, including arches, frames within frames (and sometimes frames within frames within frames), spirals, shapes, Dutch angles, cinema verite and deep reds, Tak Fujimoto proves once again why he is one of the most respected and sought after DP's in Hollywood. Toni Colette, I love you!!! I forgive you for Cosi!! She shines in this film. She could have gone for the whiny over the top single mom but instead she walks that fine wire between realism and a typical Hollywood stereotype. Fantastic! If she decides to stay in Hollywood I hope she continues to find great scripts and roles she can make her own. I have decided that Haley Joel Osment is one of those Webster people who only look 10 but are really 60 because no child should be able to emote so well! Lucas, watch this and realize what you could have had! Jake Lloyd, watch this film 40 times and go back to acting school! Mark Whalberg. Wow! I didn't have a clue that it was him until I was reminded in the closing credits that he was even in it. I knew he could act before but he brings intensity to this performance that stays with you throughout the film's duration. Well done. If I have one complaint it is that I felt the jumps and make-up effects were unnecessary. We have seen a child throw up green pee soup before, we don't need to see it again. But it doesn't break the mood. Proof that Hollywood can punch out eerie and smart films when they want to. {If you like this one, and even if you don't, check out Roeg's Don't Look Now!!

I enjoyed it back in 1993, but on seeing it again last night all manner of uncharitable thoughts kept popping into my head, chief among them the impression that Spielberg, who had lavished so much effort on `Jaws', just wasn't trying.The dinosaur mystique is hard for me to understand. Sure, they're fantastic beasties, but so are many other extinct animals; and if I had a choice I'd rather pay to see a mammoth, or a giant wombat, or a tiny Eocene horse. But PART of the dinosaur mystique is bound up with the idea of a lost world. That's what really thrills people about `King Kong'. The island Spielberg's dinosaurs occupy, by contrast, is prosaic and modern. No doubt it was a deliberate artistic decision to combine dinosaurs with cars, electric fences, caf\u00e9s and air vents, but it's hard to find two consecutive shots that don't remind us of the modern world in some way, most of the charm of the creatures is thereby lost. This is the more inexcusable in a film that throws everything else to the winds - story, character, wit, plausibility - to concentrate on the strangely attractive flavour of dinosaurs.As for the dinosaurs ... Some time before `Jurassic Park' there was the Cambrian explosion, when all manner of special effects techniques proliferated; after `Jurassic Park' all, with the exception of computer animation, became extinct, or virtually extinct. It's not the film's fault. Most of the dinosaurs on display did NOT originate in the belly of a computer; those that did look neither better nor worse than those that did not. The computer animation is more than adequate but charmless, with something subtly but deeply wrong - exactly like all subsequent computer animation. The art hasn't progressed. `Jurassic Park' is still as good as it gets.So far, so bland: what's intolerable is the preaching. This was the only thing that irritated me in 1993 and it irritates me more now. The moral of the story, with which we are repeatedly bludgeoned, is twofold: (a) people who think they don't like children are either mistaken or villains, in either case in need of therapy; and (b) man should not play God - any attempt to develop some biological science will strike us down, because of chaos theory, or quantum mechanics, or some such. This is all piffle. But it's not the ridiculous messages that annoys me: it's the fact that I'm being preached to AT ALL, and so clumsily. (Did you, too, develop a desire to throttle Jeff Goldblum in mid-speech? I hope so.) `Jaws' didn't pretend that it was a statement about how we will be struck down by divine anger if we arrogantly disregard nature and go swimming at the beach."}, {"rank": 144, "name": "Jurassic Park", "movie_year": "1993", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "I saw this movie when I was ten and it scared the heck out of me!

Dinosaurs are cloned, but we get little sense of the moral issues surrounding this. We have no sympathy for the dinosaurs, nor do we have discernable villians to hate. Hammond is portrayed as a cruel industrialist one minute(when feeding the raptors), and a Daddy Warbucks the next(the hatching of the raptor). The scientists who did the sinful deeds are in the background, and we are left with a lawyer to hiss at! Some may say the Raptors are the villians, but this insults the Frankenstein mythos(since the raptors were created by humans). If there is any discernable moral to the story it is that Alan Grant goes from hating children to \"kinda liking\" them--which is amazing when considering the whiny brats he was stuck with.\nBut I could forgive the moral nihlism of the story if it wasnt for the hackneyed action of the narrative.

More or less, JP deserved credit for giving the most astonishing special f/x ever, which surprisingly hold up pretty well with everything that Hollywood has come up with until now.

Jurassic Park is one of the most underrated movies ever. Yes, I did say underrated. True, it is the fourth highest grossing movie ever (for the time being) and was a motion picture bible for eight-year-olds across the country, but it has never been regarded as artistically superior. When, in reality, it is one of the most artistically inventive movies ever. It contains all of Spielberg's magical strokes of genius from fantastic art direction and wonderful camera techniques to astounding technical quality ( which comes from his well known control over technology). The minor flaws of a theme park are masterfully embedded into the art direction, script etc. and the acting is superb. This is one of the only movies I've seen with great acting by children. Spielberg's camera usage ranges from foreshadowing the appearance of dinosaurs with extreme up-angles to exquisitely composed scenes of the dinosaurs' \"interaction\" with the characters. Aside from technical quality, Jurassic Park bears powerful social messages of human intrusion and destruction of natural environment and the self-revering nature of man. Also, it had an undeniable effect on cinema being one of the first movies to use CGI at such a large scale. However, the most ingenious aspect of the film is the portrayal of the dinosaurs as animals rather than ruthless monsters. At many times throughout the movie, the humans are portrayed as antagonists and the respect and appreciation of the dinosaurs is wonderfully developed.

The creative genius has done it again, by simply returning to the thriller genre that shot him to fame with Jaws.....with the same intensity and thrills.

Using the visual effects, Steven has captured the imagination of the entire planet, making JP the most successful film of all time (until 1998). He has tapped into the audience's greatest fears, and used them against us to a horrifying degree. Who can forget the terrifying T-Rex first lumbering out of her enclosure, and don't forget her chasing the tour jeep! This is the ultimate Steven Spielberg film......if ever there was one......an adventure/thriller surpassed by no other. Seeing this for the first time in 1993 when I was only 11 years old....it scared the crap out of me. I couldn't sleep for a week....let alone eat properly. I am proud to be part of the JP phenomenon....as it certainly defined a Steven Spielberg film. As always, his direction of the characters is unique, and will never be rivalled.....never. Just take a look at character reactions to the dinosaurs, and especially the apparent misunderstandings between Alan and Tim. John Williams' score is awesome.....once again defining a Spielberg film. Williams' originality in the thriller genre has also been revisited 18 years after Jaws. Michael Kahn's film editing in the continuity aspect of things is the only flaw, where one can immeadiately pick up on his mistakes.....although, there are not many, the mistakes sure do stand out like a sore thumb. In spite of this, the continuity doesn't let the film down.....as the common movie-goer rarely picks up on editing mistakes (thank God!) especially in a movie like this when you're more concerned about crapping your pants for 120 mins straight. Overall, JP is a gem when it comes to thriller film-making.....it epitomises the genre and the credit 'A Steven Spielberg Film'.

I saw it for the first time when I was 10. And at that age, a movie like this will terrify a young child to the bones, and this one did just that. The scene in the kitchen with the raptors was horribly tense. I can't think of a time I've been more scared. But now that I'm older, and a little more mature, it's hard to find a movie that will scare me like that ever again. And that's a little sad, because I like it when a movie scares me. It shows that the people who made the movie did a good job. But aside from the fact that I was scared, I also enjoyed it very much. The dinosaurs looked real, some of the acting was pretty good, which in my opinion is important for any movie.In the end, this movie is one of my favourites.

This samurai is desperate. Mifune has no master and no money. Kurosawa doesn't let you see his desperation, instead focusing on the back of his head and his profile to set up one of the most memorable characters in cinema history. The film has been copied many times, its practically the most influential film of the modern action genre. Yojinbo isn't action packed however, Kurosawa takes his time setting up characters and plot. The fact that this masterless samurai has deep compassion for strangers is different than most modern action movies alone. Toshiro Mifune is magical in the lead role.

It is rare that a film and its subsequent re-make can be equally enjoyable and of equal quality, but such is the case. In Kurosawa's original, Toshiro Mifune portrays \"The Man With No Name\" and is just as mysterious, witty and sarcastic as that tough, skinny American. Fans of Leone's Westerns would be very wise to witness this great film. Comparisons are pretty futile since both are of different cultural settings and the action in both are exceedingly excellent.

It's been used a number of times but once again it was Kurosawa who sowed the seed.The film is full of humour, but at the same time carries a certain seriousness, and we get to see the full scope of Mifune's acting ability.

A lone samurai, Sanjuro Kuwabatake (Toshiro Mifune) drifts into a small town. Soon he discovers that the town is divided into two groups who are constantly fighting with one another.

The film starts with the central character, a Ronin (landless Samurai)at a crossroads. He squats down and spins a bottle. When it stops, he takes the direction indicated. There is a town at war. Two rival factions, each owning factories of some description, have hired mercenaries and criminals and are busy attempting to wipe each other out whilst the ordinary villagers are caught in the middle. The Ronin finds this amusing and starts to play both sides against the middle, first demonstrating his skill by killing a number of mercenaries (Cooper...three coffins *pause* *look* maybe four.....) and accepting one rival's bid and then leaving and accepting the other, leaving also a trail of uncertainty and worry in his wake. The Ronin is unshaven, unwashed and very, very skillful - a shark among minnows. He is also sardonic, sarcastic and gives the appearance of caring nothing. But from time to time, a glimmer of honour and belief shines, albeit briefly before being covered up once more. I won't go into more specific detail about this film lest I ruin it for those that have yet to see it. The director is Akira Kurasawa, the main actor Toshiiro Mifune, two of the best reasons for seeing this film. It was subsequently remade by Morricone as \"a fistful of dollars\". His initial claim that he was remaking Fellini's \"a servant of two masters\" held water for precisely two seconds.

This film stands with the finest works of Steinbeck and Hemingway, the paintings of Thomas Hart Benton and Georgia O'Keefe just to name a few as some of the finest work American artists have offered the world. Based on B. Traven's marxist tome, the film centers around three prospectors encountering greed, betrayal and death while prospecting for gold in the Mexican mountains.

Bogart stars as Fred C. Dobbs, a man living in the town of Tampico, who is always broke and can't find work to make money so begs for quarters on the street corners.One day, Dobbs hears a man asking for another person to go work for him. Dobbs goes but the man never pays and disappears when they get back to Tampico. However, Bogart and his friend find him and beat him until he gives them the money. The two men go to an inn where they hear an old man (Walter Huston) talking about gold and how to get it. This makes Bogart think and after convincing his friend (Tim Holt) to go with him, the two men go see the old man who is called Howard and he agrees without hesitation and so the three men set off to find gold. And so begins an adventure these three men will never forget.As soon as they begin finding gold, you see exactly how gold drove men crazy at that time. Bogart becomes paranoid and loses his trust in his two friends. The three men naturally don't have an easy life up there and you see quite well through the whole movie how the gold diggers reacted to gold at that time.

TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE is an adventure flick that also happens to explore the depths of human nature in certain situations. Its greatness lies in the performances and double takes the Humphrey Bogart character throws at co-stars Tim Holt and Walter Huston, the great character actor father of the director (John Huston). Bogart plays \"Fred C.Dobbs\" in a noticeably unique change of pace from his usually slick and fast-talking characters. Greed, gunfights and hard labor are key elements of the adventure which centers on a gold rush that would test any kind of person, considering the conditions. Mexico was no easy bag to travel through in 1925 as the Great Depression was in full swing.Walter Huston turns in what many consider to be his best acting as the \"old man\" who tries to be both father-figure and referee to Holt and Bogie. Huston is always way ahead of the two rivals during their journey through the plains and mountains. They strike gold, of course, and the film's screenplay takes off at this point. The elder Huston warns us in the opening sequence that \"ther's no tellin' what gold could do to a man,\" and indeed he is right. Bogie is clearly headed towards insanity, while Holt tries to hold his own. Huston is the optimistic, yet cynical centerpiece these guys need.The best scenes take place at night, especially when the three gold-diggers begin a comical trading of places, protecting their share of the gold. Bogart's face is shot in a manner that reveals to us his intentions and his oncoming madness. Director John Huston mixes location and studio shots well to create a relatively realistic gold rush in harsh terrain. Surprise is always in the air. You never know who the good guys or the bad guys are. Greed is the most important part of human nature examined, especially through Bogie's character.TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE falls slightly within the Western Genre as well with Mounties chasing bandits and a one on three standoff over a watering hole in the dirt. The picture is fantastic at entertaining us and moving us simultaneously and Walter Huston is at his best in front of his own son's camera. Who knew best? Father or son?

Dobbs and his fellow pal, Curtin (Tim Holt) are both roaming the streets of Tampico looking for work. The two get stiffed by a contractor that refused to pay them and go to a flophouse to get some sleep. It is there that they meet an old prospector. He tells them about gold in the hills and that he's looking for a few men to go up there with him to claim the fortune. Dobbs and Holt agree to accompany the old man (Walter Huston), and the trio set off. After arriving at the hill, they begin prospecting and soon have enough cash to last them a very long time. Soon though, Dobbs becomes very insecure and begins thinking that the other two are scheming to take his fortune. Dobbs, now clearly being controlled by greed, will even resort to murder to protect and gain more riches.It is at this point where we see that it is too late for Dobbs, he is consumed by greed and is now a different man than the one we knew at the beginning of the movie.There you have it.

King Arthur (Graham Chapman) and his knights of Camelot, Sir Launcelot (John Cleese), Sir Galahad (Michael Palin), Sir Bedevere (Terry Jones), and Sir Robin (Eric Idle) are instructed by God to seek out the legendary goblet owned by Christ. From there, its non-stop laughter as the bumbling knights and king attempt to find the Holy Grail, but only succeed in fooling everything up and basically looking like idiots.\nI decided to write a review of this movie since I learned that it is now being released on DVD. I can't wait until it comes out! I know I'm definetly going to rent this one! The move has produced some of the most memorible lines and scenes in film history, such as the bridge of death, the Knights who say \"Ni!\", and many, many, more. The only complaint I have about this film is the ending, which seemed forced posiblly from running out of ideas. But the bulk of the film more than makes up for the shoddy ending.

Both movies though have lines you can quote forever.Let me compare the greatest movie of all time (Fist of the North Star, cartoon, English dubbed version), and this movie... which is almost the greatest movie. Both have EXACTLY THE SAME QUALITIES. Listen up, people:Both movies have memorable scenes you WILL NEVER forget (like the Black knight, killer rabbit, Tom, Anthrax Castle, Knights who say \"Ni!\", the guards who can't follow orders, the bloody massacre in the castle for no reason, the troll guarding the bridge of death, and many other scenes)Seriously.. thinking back.. this movie is ALMOST as funny and great as fist of the north star.Both movies have lines you will always quote (like \"You must cut down the mightiest tree in the forest.... with a... herring!!!\", and \"we are an autonomous collective!!!\", and \"I fart in your general direction!!!\")And of course both movies have characters you will never forget.That is why this is one of the greatest movies of all time, and why Fist of the North Star is THE GREATEST movie of all time.(fist of the north star has more quotable lines, infinitely funnier scenes, and unforgettable characters)But yes, so does Holy Grail... it has Memorable scenes. Quotable lines. it's also FUNNY AS ALL HELL.A true classic.People that say \"American Pie\" and \"There's Something about Mary\" are the funniest movies of all time have NOT seen this movie.Oh one more thing... you'll want to watch both movies OVER and OVER and OVER again.Like UHF.

When you throw so many jokes at the audience you're guaranteed to have success.John Cleese is marvellous particularly as Sir Lancelot but also as the Frenchman. Graham Chapman is as usual the straightman to the rest of the Python's fun but he is also good as Arthur, King of the Britons. The rest of the crew give some of their best work and the animation which was particularly annoying in the series is used sparingly here.If you like Pythons you'll adore this.

It would be inaccurate to characterize it as a prisoner-of-war film. It doesn't compare to \"Stalag 17\" in its depiction of barracks life in the prison camps. For one thing, \"The Great Escape\" was filmed in glorious technicolor with the Alps and forests of Germany as a backdrop. Much of the film occurs outside. \"Stalag 17\", by contrast, is filmed in gritty black and white with the mud of a German winter in the background. Virtually the entire film occurs indoors. For a realistic portrayal of what life in a German prison camp might have been like watch \"Stalag 17\".\"The Great Escape\" is primarily an action film. The prison camp is merely a launching point for the movie's action, which features a tunnel cave-in, furious chases through picturesque German villages, leaps from a speeding train and a plane crash. Steve McQueen's stunt riding on a bicycle provides some of the greatest moments in any film and is every bit as exciting as the famous car chase in his film \"Bullit\".The international cast does a grand job of acting. The characterizations are rich. The viewer cannot help but identify with these characters. The character of \"Big X\" played by Richard Attenborough is complex. He reminds me of a prize fighter who has had one fight to many. In this case he has been in the ring with the Gestapo, and it shows. Hendley played by James Garner is the scrounger. He is the person the prisoners go to when they need travel documents, a camera or tunnel digging tools. He is a cynic. At the end of the film he asks \"Was it worth it?\" There is plenty of suspense in this film. Which ones will escape? You pick your favorites and hope they make it. Some do. Some don't. There is disappointment when Steve McQueen's motorcycle wipes out within a few feet of the Swiss border and freedom. There is a feeling of elation when James Coburn's guide appears and points at the mountains in the distance with the one word line \"Espana\". Light moments are few in this film. The Fourth of July celebration complete with prison camp moonshine is an initial success, but disaster intrudes on the fun. The guards find one of the tunnels, and a prisoner is shot while trying to escape.The film has a very human quality to it. The prisoners have very human faults. The obsession of \"Big X\" with getting back at the Germans for torturing him is an example. Charles Bronson's character is a genius at building tunnels but is a claustrophobic.The Germans are not depicted as uniformly evil. The prison camp commandant (played by Hannes Messemer) is a compassionate man. He is quite a contrast to Otto Preminger's commandant in \"Stalag 17\". Robert Graf's character, \"Werner, the Ferret\", is a mixed up but generally sincere and kind person. He and Garner share a few moments of friendship in the film. It is Garner who violates the code to lift Werner's wallet to provide the documents that the prisoners need. The Gestapo is portrayed as evil and sadistic. In the film's early moments one of their men threatens \"X\" that \"if you fall into our hands again, you will not be so lucky.\" Later, he makes good on that threat.This is a memorable film that works on many levels. Few war films have had such a blend of great acting, beautiful scenery and exciting action. Interestingly, there is little of the graphic violence and blood that accompany most war films. The violence is subtle. When the 50 prisoners are executed at the end of the film only the machine gun and an empty truck are shown. It is all too clear what has happened.Watch this film and \"Stalag 17\" as a pair. They provide interesting comparative approaches to the grim realities of prison camp life.

In 1963, the best actor Oscar went to Sidney Poitiers for \"Lilies of the field\" and this is totally all right by me. However, I came to notice that \"The great escape\" didn't get any nominations either for acting, directing, or even best picture. And this movie is ranked #81 on our IMDb voting list whereas the 1963 winner for best picture, \"Tom Jones\", isn't even there. Maybe \"Tom Jones\" deserved the best picture that year, but \"The great escape\" should definitely have had at least a nomination. Captain Virgil Hilts (Steve McQueen) winds up in a German prison camp where he doesn't know anyone. But there isn't only him in that camp. A few days after he arrives at the camp, a well-known English Captain, Bartlett (Richarrd Attenborough), arrives as well and decides to take matters into his own hands by preparing escape plans for at least 250 of the prisoners in the camp. Naturally, a job like this one requires a lot of help. So he gets Hendley \"The Scrounger\" (James Garner), Danny Velinski \"Tunnel King\" (Charles Bronson), Colin Blythe \"The Forger\" (Donald Pleasance), and Sedgwick \"Manufacturer\" (James Coburn) to team up with him to make this one the biggest escape from a concentration camp ever. This one has to be THE great escape. At first, Hilts declines Bartlett's proposition to join his group claiming that he is going to escape much earlier than the rest of the group. But after he screws up and is sent to \"The cooler\", he decides to join up with Bartlett as soon as he is released from \"The cooler\" and when he does, the Germans begin wishing these men never entered this concentration camp in their whole life. But even though these men are pros at this kind of work, the Germans are able to find out about a few of their plans but to keep myself from spoiling anything, I won't tell you anymore about the movie itself. Director John Sturges has indeed directed some very god movies including the great \"The magnificent seven\", but he truly outdid himself in \"The great escape\". The movie offers suspense, action, and some good laughs as well and keeps you wondering what will happen to the main characters until you do see what does happen. Steve McQueen gives one of his best performances and Attenborough is excellent as well. Some of the best scenes of the movie are when you see the Americans preparing their escape and all the work and trouble they have to go through to get it done. It's definitely the greatest escape I've ever seen."}, {"rank": 151, "name": "The Great Escape", "movie_year": "1963", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "A silly, silly movie. I rented it based upon the rave reviews on this site, and only sat through until the end so I could add my own review. I love war movies, but this thing was a combination of \"Hogan's Heroes\" and \"Gilligan's Island\". I should have known by the goofy little theme song in the beginning that it was just a piece of Hollywood fluff, circa 1963. I find it truly hard to believe that others have rated it highly.My main problem with the film is that everybody and everything is a Hollywood cliche or stereotype. The camp guards spend the movie ignorantly staring into space while the escape plan magically develops before them, and the Commandant is downright sympathetic to the plight of his prisoners. And why were they trying to escape, anyways? I lost track of the number of scenes showing clean, healthy, well fed, well groomed \"prisoners\" sitting around smoking pipes in their sweaters, fer cryin' out loud! And the camp itself looked like an upscale hunting lodge during a comfortable summer. Imagine a 3 hour Nazi prison movie without one single unpleasant scene! This movie is nothing less than an insult to anyone that managed to survive a Nazi camp, and the millions that didn't. Heck, I look worse after a good night's sleep than these \"prisoners\" did after 20 days in solitary. I always wondered where the idea came from to make a TV sit-com about a WWII German P.O.W. camp (Hogan's Heroes). After seeing this completely unbelievable waste of time I now know. If you want a good WWII movie rent \"Patton\" or \"Saving Private Ryan\". This thing is just a bad comedy. I would give it a \"3\" out of \"10\".

It is very difficult to believe that prisoners of war would constantly be so cavalier about everything. The film creates a bunch of fun but ultimately trivial characters that inhabit an all-too-unreal prison camp. While they cover slightly different ground, Grand Illusion and Stalag 17 both are superior films for presenting a more balanced view of prison life. In spite of the poor script and silly characterizations, the film does have many merits. The European locations are wonderful and look fantastic. The score is riveting. And the cast provides an informative glimpse into Hollywood, 1963. This is one of the last great studio action films. Soon, films that some of the stars of this film are in, like Bullit and Death Wish, would replace the WWII film as the action/adventure standard. The world was moving forward, away from the patriotism and myth that surrounded the second war. The great legacy of this film is that it provides one last look back into that lost world and shows why it was so compelling to Americans.

They are attacked by a bandit and in the fight the nobleman is killed. There is a trial at which we hear the bandit's version and then the wife's. A Bhuddist medium summons the soul of the dead man and gives his version. Many events coincide (a fight, a death) but the meanings and implications in each version differ a great deal. Three men discuss the events and significance of the differences while they take shelter from a pouring rain under the gate to the city. One of these is a woodcutter; he not only observed the trial and tells his companions what was said but he, hidden in the woods, also actually saw the events and he tells his friends his version. Again we find the coinciding events but the differing meanings and implications. He'd not told anyone else what he'd seen or testified because he didn't want to get involved. He's very puzzled and disturbed as to why each version differs, what do these differences say about the nature of people?This is a powerful, beautiful movie which altered the linear style of movie narratives that had existed until then and opened new vistas, e.g., \"Crash,\" \"Hero\" and Eastwood's two \"Iwo Jimas\"s. When I first saw this movie 40 years ago, its slight misogynist flavor (women are manipulative) didn't register on me and probably didn't on most others in the 1950s-60s; our culture has probably shifted a great deal since then.But \"Rashomon\" has significance far beyond its contribution to movie making. I'll point to its influence on Family Therapy; an analogous effect is true for history or ANY field in which there can be points of view that differ with human motivations and alliances (say world history from the point of view of victors or vanquished, or various anthropologists accounts of living with particular tribes, etc.)\"The Rashomon Effect\" (a term used in family systems) refers to the quite different perceptions that even closely related individuals can have of the same event or person. E.g., in any family, say one with several children, no family member has quite the same view of any other family member. In a real sense, none of the children have quite the same mother or father and therefore must view them and each other differently. The first born child entered the family when its parents had a certain financial level and experiences. The second child enters when the parents have been changed by time and the experience of having a first child so they are not quite the same parents. If the parents invested in the first child particular aspirations or hopes, favoritism or disfavor, that must strongly color that child's view of them and any younger siblings, as well as a second child's view of each parent, the older sib, etc. These various views can differ greatly among all members of that family system. \"The Rashomon Effect\" identifies and emphasizes the existence of these differences."}, {"rank": 152, "name": "Rashomon", "movie_year": "1950", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Rashomon is a rather brilliant film by the outstanding Japanese director Akira Kurusawa.

The make-up is skillful, especially in the sequence where the wife is \"possessed\" by her dead husband's spirit. The theatrical opposition of the players contributes to an other-worldly ambiance and the movie has a haunting score. These factors give it a texture which is intriguing and almost dream-like.The characters are supremely well-performed, especially by the always-impressive Toshiro Mifune (playing the bandit) and also by Machiko Kyo (playing the nobleman's wife). It is said that before shooting began each day Kurosawa showed Mifune a short film of a wild lion in the jungle and asked the actor to imitate the creature - after seeing the agitated, nervous and mannerism-ridden bandit he represents I can believe it. Kyo was apparently a relative newcomer to film-making and if so this was a very impressive debut as the in-turns faithful, treacherous, child-like and manipulative wife.Of course, the film attracts its interest chiefly from the story itself - four people tell differing versions of a murder and rape, with three of them individually taking responsibility for the murder - endless analyses have been made to explain it or pronounce it unexplainable but most people agree that it deals with the subjectiveness of the concept of truth. What we regard as true seems to always be heavily influenced by our own standpoint.Although re-filmed by Hollywood as the Outrage (1964) and obviously inspiring more recent films (Courage Under Fire, Snake Eyes) the original is unsurpassable in visual splendor, the vividness of the characters and its enigmatic plot."}, {"rank": 152, "name": "Rashomon", "movie_year": "1950", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Two millennia after Pilate posed his conundrum, there still exists no answer better than Kurosawa's.

Campbell Jr.'s 1938 novella, \"Who Goes There?\", as a baseline by which to compare the two films that strived to bring it to the screen; that is, \"The Thing(From Another World)\" released in 1951, and \"The Thing\" released in 1982. Keep in mind that I consider Campbell's tale one of the best sci-fi horror stories ever written, and that it would be quite a feat to successfully adapt it to cinema. The 1951 film, directed by Christain Nyby, deviated so much from the story that it is difficult to draw many parallels between the two. In the story, the alien is a 4 ft tall being with three red eyes, rubbery,blue,wormlike hair and multiple razor- sharp tentacles. This alien \"chameleon\" is so intelligent that its species figured out long ago how to imitate any living creature through DNA duplication and replication. This uncanny, insidious imitation extended to the personality and mind of it's victims. The end of the story further highlights its superior intellect by featuring a strap-on anti-gravity device powered by a small atomic generator that it had built within the mere span of one week by scrounging spare parts at the compound - coiled wires, radio tubes, coffee-tins, glass, magnets, leather and cloth belts, etc. The alien was killed before it could make it's escape and eventually imitate the living composition of the entire planet! In the 1951 film version, the alien is portrayed as an 8 ft tall hairless Frankenstein-like humanoid, with flesh of a vegetable- like quality which needed blood to reproduce itself through seedpods. The film is standard horrorfare, with the expedition crew uniting together to fight and destroy the alien menace, which they eventually did, via electrocution. The alien is not characterized as particularly intelligent, rather as a rampaging, blood-thirsty monster; making it hard to imagine such a brute was advanced enough to participate in interstellar travel. So while, \"The Thing(From Another World) featured excellent direction, acting, dialogue, score and so forth under the watchful eye of producer/shadow director, Howard Hawks, I feel he took artistic license and deviated too much from Campbell's story. There was suspense and terror to be sure, but it lacked the pervasive paranoia that Campbell conveyed so well in \"Who Goes There?\" In sharp contrast, director John Carpenter's 1982 version, \"The Thing\", both brilliantly captures the alien's insidious chameleon-like powers (through Rob Bottin's effects) and the paranoia it induced amongst the expedition's crew. Instead of bonding together as a cohesive unit as in the 1951 film, to fight a readily discernable foe, they fragmented in the face of a remarkably cunning enemy capable of imitating any one of them; they become deeply suspicious and paranoid of one another as any of them could be the alien in disguise, and they literally ask, \"is it really you, WHO GOES THERE?\"; echoing the name of the novella's title. This situation runs counter to classic character development, as how could anyone be stable and well-defined with their core-identity as such risk? Who's who? who's the good guy? bad guy? Perhaps a little unsettling to viewers and critics. I think this film has received a battering from movie critics because they were weaned on relishing a steady, inexorable buildup of suspense and an inevitable resolution. However, in \"The Thing\", this suspense is permeated with a claustrophobic paranoia and sullen dread, generating an atmospheric ambiguity - something the critics weren't comfortable with, hence, rejected. Combine this ambiguity with the critic's aversion to the graphic special effects, wholly appropriate to the storyline, but misinterpreted by them as \"gratuitous violence and gore\", then one understands why \"The Thing\" got butchered in the reviews. Here, as in the Campbell story, MacReady is the acknowledged hero, even before he tested himself as human, for we instinctively knew he would be. However, in the story, MacReady, with the aid of several genuinely human crewmembers, kills the alien and in doing so, literally saves the planet. Whereas, in the 1982 film, MacReady, valiant as he is, just isn't powerful enough to stop the alien. Thus, the open-ended ending; the lack of closure being a disappointment to me; I immediately thought \"sequel\", but have yet to see one. Also, keep in mind that in the story, the alien starts and ends with his original form, whereas in the 1982 film, the alien never has a definitive original form, being relatively amorphous throughout. In the final analysis, I like both of these films, in spite of their shortcomings; namely, the 1951 film's failure to adhere closely to the story, thereby failing to capture the essence of the imitative alien and paranoid atmosphere it generated; and the 1982 film's failure to remain faithful to the story's optimistic ending. Actually, both films stand up fairly well when referenced to Campbell's chilling tale, and even better when viewed as stand-alones. One thing is for sure, both films have earned a secure place in my video collection."}, {"rank": 153, "name": "The Thing", "movie_year": "1982", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "I've watched this film countless times and it never bores me.

John Carpenter's attention to character is unwavering in this story, making the impending doom that much more horrifying.

They've made a startling unveiling of a mysterious life-form...but little do they realize the destructive capabilities of this creature. This alien creature is so malevolent that as it mutates, it assimilates the form of its nearest, most unlucky victim.

However, as the toll rises, any one of Russell's colleagues...may in fact, be part of the demon already...THE THING is an engrossing horror film with some of the most grotesque special effects seen on the screen. The literally eye-popping effects include melting faces, cremations, walking heads, deformity, heads bursting out of stomachs, and other sequences too gruesome to print in words alone. THE THING though, has been sadly criticized by film connoisseurs as merely exercise of disgusting special effects. In my sincere and humble opinion, THE THING is a film with more substance than what most movie critics have said.This film is a parable. The expedition must learn to trust one another and stick together in order to essentially survive. Another interesting aspect about THE THING is that this movie shows what would happen if fear and isolation conquer a whole group. The consequences are devastating, people end up fighting each other and debating violently, instead of trying to work together to alleviate the problem. This film conveys a lesson saying that trusting one another and teamwork are the two main components for survival against the odds. Without those two traits, then everything else, even technology itself...is meaningless...THE THING is a great movie to watch in the dark during midnight. You will be guaranteed to jump out of your seat at least a few times. THE THING delivers its fair shares of shocks and jolts.Although the story-line in this film is not very efficient, it doesn't distract from the tension and suspense of this movie.

This film also has one of the best endings I have ever seen. Dean Cundy's photography is fantastic and serves the film well. The biggest star of the film are the physical special effects...something a hundred computer generated films could never touch on.

I find myself curious about the people who find themselves stationed in that far corner of the world. Carpenter never tells us anything about them, which gives us a voyeuristic feel. Great special effects and a good plot move the story along. The tension builds unceasingly as you slowly realize that all of the people in this film are doomed.

It puts to shame such films as \"Aliens\" or \"Armageddon\" that are content to inundate the viewer with special effects while their plots revolve around stunts that butcher the laws of physics, testosterone-laden one-liners, heroes equipped with enough artillery to conquer Iraq, and pathetic attempts to inject \"meaning\" into the barrage on screen with \"emotional sequences\" that only serve to further insult the intelligence of the audience. The supreme tragedy, of course, is that these kind of lobotomized movies are also the most popular. I think that there is a cause for this, although it isn't very comforting. There is an increasing trend in our culture to passively \"surrender\" to the media -- to immerse oneself in the images we see without dedicating a single brain cell to comprehending the statement the work is trying to make. This mindset is becoming increasingly dominant in all arenas; even the once-hallowed print medium is being diluted, thanks to the abominable \"reader response\" theory that pervades our schools and the \"tabloid brigade\" that lines our magazine racks whose mentality appears to be infiltrating the once-venerable mainstream press. Nowadays, we just flip the switch and put our minds on \"pause.\" Is \"The Thing\" a \"good\" movie? For the rare individual who still values his faculty of reason, a more appropriate term would be \"entertaining.\" Its plot keeps one guessing, its ending is uncompromising, and it has some redeeming statements to make about human paranoia. Upon subsequent viewings, one begins to note a conspicuous lack of depth in the acting, but the taut storyline remains compelling.

Backed by a pounding, heartbeat-like synthesizer score from the brilliant Ennio Morricone, \"The Thing\" opens (following a pre-titles UFO \"teaser\") with striking, beautifully choreographed images of a low flying helicopter chasing a dog through a desolate, frozen landscape. The finale is just as stunningly filmed, the story bleakly and ambiguously ending in that same landscape awash in redhot flames. In between, \"The Thing\" offers some of the most potently horrific sequences ever shot. John W. Campbell's original short story \"Who Goes There?\" is followed much more closely here than in Howard Hawks' version, resulting in some awesomely effective man-to-monster transformations. Although these make-up effects have been much copied since 1982, the film has lost little of its power to shock even the most jaded of horror fans. Carpenter's direction is stylish and assured, filling almost every sequence with the maximum amount of dread and suspense possible. Add Morricone's thumping, eerie music to the mix and you end up with one of the most terrifying of all movie experiences.

Strike one: it is a remake, and one that dares (God forbid) to be a different film than it's predecessor.

This unfortunate man, John Merrick, could never hope to live in society, and was forced to endure a wretched existence as a fairground exhibit - the 'Elephant Man'. Merrick came to the attention of a surgeon, Frederick Treves, who rescued him and helped him reclaim his human dignity. This true story is the subject of David Lynch's astonishingly powerful film. The 'look' of the film is a tour de force of sheer brilliance. Not only are the images aesthetically resonant and horribly beautiful, but they also reinforce (and even shape) the film's very meaning. In a recent TV interview, Lynch explained his choice of monochrome for \"The Elephant Man\" by saying, \"Some movies cry out for black and white. Black and white removes you from reality and you can drift into another world.\" It certainly holds true in this case. Veteran cinematographer Freddie Francis has worked miracles, recreating 19th-century London as if old engravings had been brought to life. Lynch and Francis have set about composing an essay on the grotesque. Two whores fight in a pub, their faces distorted by rage and injuries. The operating theatre, with its bizarre stands and clamps, is a parody of a factory, little more than another Victorian processing plant. Lamplight casts tortured, exaggerated shadows. The band of carnival freaks who liberate Merrick constitute a monstrous procession of deformity as they escort him to safety. And the purpose of it all? To descant on Merrick's own distorted form, and to comment on the Victorian psyche, with its morbid interest in the grotesque. Bytes, the fairground 'owner' of Merrick, gives out a story to the paying public that Merrick's mother was attacked by an elephant during her pregnancy. The film begins with disturbing images of toplit elephants in a black nothingness, a woman in the throes of childbirth, and a close-up of the portrait of his mother which Merrick keeps with him at all times. From this nightmare we move into the organised nightmare of the fairground, where people pay to be frightened. A board near Merrick's cage reads \"The Fruit Of The Original Sin\", so that revellers can comfort themselves by supposing that what has been visited upon poor Merrick is in some way his own fault, or at least it was 'meant to be'. It is our own moral deformity, not on display as nakedly as this wretch's physical dystrophy, which prompts us to stare and to mock. The Victorians had a passion for machinery, and the film sustains a brilliant metaphor of human society as being just another apparatus. Fairgrounds are machines of entertainment and profit. The public is circulated around the stalls and its money extracted. The grim streets around the London Hospital form an apparatus for housing the workers, hovels laid out in joyless serried ranks, conveniently close to factories and wharves. Even the hospital is a processing machine, with its regimented lines of beds and its severe architecture. By moving from fairground to hospital, Merrick has left one industrial monster and been swallowed by another. Even the public urinal is a comment on the Victorian obsession with 'order', its troughs arranged as regularly as looms in a cotton mill. Because Merrick's poor distorted body offends against these notions of symmetry, he is despised and vilified. Steam and flame recur as images throughout the film in endless variations. Steam was the Victorians' power-source, the foundation of their wealth and confidence, quite literally the supplier of their drive. Here, it represents the dark energy of the human psyche, so admirable when harnessed properly, so destructive when it breaks the bounds of social discipline. Fire is the enlightening goodness of science, the Promethean beneficence of Treves and his circle, real Victorians who belie the stereotype of pompous and sinister hypocrisy, and who go to enormous pains to nurture and protect a malformed wretch such as Merrick.\n And for all the terrible suffering of Merrick, this is film is a resounding tribute to human kindness. As viewers, our cynical expectations are continually being defeated. Treves does not treat Merrick like an anatomical specimen, but warms to the Elephant Man's innate decency. Carr Gomm does not expel the hideous creature from the hospital, but shows profound compassion. Teenage nurses are afraid of Merrick at first, but grow to love him. We suspect the fashionable actress Mrs. Kendal (played magnificently by Anne Bancroft) of taking a shallow and insincere interest in Merrick, but we are proved wrong yet again. Treves' wife (a deeply affecting performance by Hannah Gordon) is initially dismayed by Merrick's ugliness, but finds herself weeping helplessly at the tragedy of this sweet man's crushing misfortune. John Hurt, as Merrick, gives a performance which fills the viewer with awe. Hardly recognisable as a human being beneath the latex make-up, he blazons Merrick's humanity across the screen. The gentle wonder with which Merrick beholds the beauty of an ordinary middle-class drawing room is heart-breaking to witness. Anthony Hopkins and Freddie Jones, as Treves and Bytes respectively, are marvellous. Treves is tormented by a recurring doubt - is he really no better than Bytes, the deranged mountebank who believes that Merrick belongs to him? Are the two of them no more than showmen, seeking to exploit Merrick's misfortune? And flowing from that, are we, the viewers, waiting impatiently to see Merrick's face unveiled, any better than the Victorian gawkers? The film answers its own question. Decency is better than cruelty, and Treves is nobler than Bytes. We all have both Treves and Bytes within us, in varying proportions. How many of us are capable of Treves' searing self-examination? Merrick, and this magnificent film about him, touch something deep in our inner selves."}, {"rank": 156, "name": "The Elephant Man", "movie_year": "1980", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Hi all,I saw this movie for the 1st time on 5th December 1999.

It is truly a remarkably interesting film, with lots of things to say, and yet it is vaguely repellant. Not, as is pointed out in Lynch's excellent \"The Elephant Man\", for \"women or nervous persons\". Interesting, then, that Lynch should choose a subject that mirrors most of his films almost exactly.The film tells the real-life story of John Merrick, born with a deformity that most people treat as something to ridicule, profit from, or be terrified of. He is rescued by young surgeon Frederick Treves, who sets about rehabilitating him, much to the interest of Victorian-era London society, and the anger and contempt of certain members of the hospital board. In addition, we see Bytes, the man who has been exhibiting Merrick in his freak shows, and many people who want to meet him (for a number of reasons). All of this provides an interesting backdrop to the rise and decline of an extraordinary young man.The film is shot entirely in black and white, and the attention to Victorian era detail is marvellous to behold: great quantities of steam, many gaslights, the costumes are perfect and even the accents have a plausible Victorian lilt to them. Without resorting to obviously faked running scratches on the film itself, the period is clearly and brilliantly set. Similarly, the lighting and cinematography is meticulously crafted. A special mention must also go to John Morris, who composed the score. Without being too intrusive or distracting, the music gently accents the beauty that the film has to offer, and conveys a sense of wonder at the appropriate moments.It must be pointed out, however, that the film progresses far too slowly in places, and a substantial part of the responsibility for this must go to Lynch for his fanciful dream-like sequences and unnecessary shots of (exquisite, certainly) sets. It can be argued that we learn a lot of Merrick's history and the era in which the film is set through these sequences, but the acting, effects, screenplay and directorial talent elsewhere do more than enough to convey this, and the rest of it just comes across as inconsequential episodes which weigh the rest of the film down.All actors and actresses imbue their characters with the dignity, helplessness, terror or aggression that they require. Freddie Jones is excellent as the pathetic yet frightening Bytes: it is refreshing to see a character portrayed so well with a dual sense of helplessness and power. Similarly, John Hurt does a marvellous job as John Merrick - especially beneath the weight and restrictive nature of Christopher Tucker's spectacular make-up. He manages to give Merrick a very real sense of dignity and humanity (surely the point of the film), and it is very possible to see the pain and humiliation in his eyes at certain points, a well-nigh-on impossible task given the nature of the make-up. Hopkins is good as Treves, (although it is not his finest hour), and the performances from Anne Bancroft and Hannah Gordon are also very well done.To conclude, \"The Elephant Man\" is a very touching and moving film, in turns fascinating and upsetting, but certainly overblown in places. If you can get past these minor quibbles, however, \"The Elephant Man\" is definitely a good film to watch, with much more to say than the average blockbuster."}, {"rank": 156, "name": "The Elephant Man", "movie_year": "1980", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "The Elephant Man is simply one of the most beautiful films ever made. I dont normally make such generalizations, but I have seen this film more than I have seen Star Wars and it moves me to emotion every time. The most important thing that I have found about this film is its portrayal of the women in the life of John Merrick. Lynch is often portrayed as a misogynist in the media and I really believe that one can gain a different perspective on his view toward women by interpreting his female characters through this film. Only the women in the film empathize with Merrick, they are the only ones that can truly understand him and love him. The scene where Mrs. Treves breaks down after Merrick tells her about his own mother is simply beautiful. You can read it all in her eyes, as she thinks about her own children and feels genuine empathy and love for Merrick. Bancroft's reaction is also without judgment and is purely love, as is the nurse (even though she may have disdained him at first). I beleive that this film gives one a deep insight into the female characters in Lynch's other productions and is necessary viewing before any attempt to understand his art can begin."}, {"rank": 156, "name": "The Elephant Man", "movie_year": "1980", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "I saw this film on video in the summer of 1985.

He was not yet a big star, but you'd never know it from his high calibre work. He gives one of his best performances of his distinguished career in \"The Elephant Man,\" regardless of his later Oscar-winning roles.David Lynch seemed to be making a movie about people, rather than just a strange story (as in almost everything else he's done before or since). Shooting it in black and white gave it both an odd feeling of authenticity, and a surreal artistic look. These are words and worlds Lynch is famous for.The movie is based on the play by Bernard Pomerance, which remains one of the most moving pieces of genuine theater there has ever been. Since the story of John Merrick is mostly true, with some dramatic license added, of course, it affects us even more. We can't imagine having to live a life with such deformity. We can't imagine how he did it. The film moves us by showing that there was a real human being much like ourselves in the body of a side show freak.In the play, the title character is performed without the aid of make up. Slides are shown of what he actually looked like, and we use our imaginations from there. In this movie, John Hurt is in full make up and prosthetics which is eventually shown on screen. Until then, we only see the other actors' reactions to his looks, which builds tension and piques our curiosity. Amazingly, both actors have an incredible task: Play a freak in human form, and to play a man in freakish form. Each calls for an actor of immense talent.

Lynch paints the true life story of Joseph \"John\" Merrick and makes him almost a Christ-Like figure.

It may sound odd, but I really believe that the non-Christian Lynch has, in the person of John Merrick portrayed one of the most profoundly moving \"Christ figures' in all of film.

And in turn, it becomes better with each viewing. I recently had the pleasure of watching a 25th Anniversary screening of \"Chinatown\" on the big wide Panavision screen. There, it was as if I were seeing it for the very first time! I was fully absorbed within the confines of the film. It was absolutely incredible. Now, I am proud to call myself a happy owner of the 25th Anniversary DVD release of \"Chinatown\". After watching the DVD, I finally feel like I fully understand all of the minute details and subplots leading up to the explosive climax of \"Chinatown\". I can also see how \"Chinatown\" is talking about the world we live in today, in a sense that in a world that is corrupt and laden with deceit and mystery, a hopeful outcome will never be. And more wisely spoken still, it is better that we forget about it all and stay out of it. \"Forget about it Jake, it's Chinatown\". The meaning is a metaphor for every person's life in the world today. It's unfortunate, but that's life! \"Chinatown\" has been labeled as a classic example of the film noir genre. I wouldn't call it such. Film noir is something like \"The Third Man\" or \"The Killing\", in which absolutely nothing good comes out of a situation and for no good reason. \"Chinatown\" had reason, and it was more of a puzzle than simplistic film noir, unraveling and unraveling until there was nothing left but the message in the climax of \"Chinatown\". I loved it! It was the first time that I really felt influenced, inspired, and deeply affected by a film. It was really riveting. The only exception to this being a really great film was the most typical Hollywood cliche that has placed films like James Cameron's \"TITANIC\" into the category of pure absurdity and stupidity. I'm talking about how the characters know each other for a day or two, and already find each other having sex. They do this sex thing in every movie, and why? Life doesn't happen that way, unless you are a complete sleazebag.

Robert Towne's script is probably the best script of all time. It encompasses all the elements of classical film noirs and uses them to tell a perfect story. The clues are fed to the audience slowly, but carefully. As Jake Gittes discovers more and more of the twisted plot revolving around the death of Mr. Mulwray, a world of disgusting corruption is found. Towne's script is reinforced by two of the greates performances of all time: Faye Dunaway and Jack Nicholson. Dunaway is the perfect femme fatale; she pulls Jake into a case that is bigger than he can handle. Nicholson plays a more thoughtful character than his usual roles. The most interesting part of the Gittes character is his vulnerability. Nicholson's nose is covered with bandages for a good part of the film to reinforce the fact that Gittes is not super-human; he will not and can not solve this case in time to save Dunaway.Finally, Roman Polanski's direction is amazing in Chinatown. His camera is a voyeur in the film. It follows just over Nicholson's shoulder, it is right next to Dunaway's face (which from interviews, I hear really disturbed her and created friction between she and Polanski), and it surveys the young L.A. landscape revealing its superficial beauty. Polanski wonderfully contrasts this beautiful image of early L.A. and the corruption underlying the plot. On the one hand we see the desert and all its stark beauty. But in another scene, the camera is dodging punches or trying to get away from Claude Mulvhill. This move definetely signified a peek in Polanski's career.

CONFIDENTIAL, although that film does not hold a candle to this. Not only does it have style, but it has as much substance, something rare in most movies. And yes, it is a product of the 1970's, the first decade when films showed the influence of their predecessors. This is an homage to film-noir, of course, but it elevates the genre to a whole new level because of its deep psychological themes. I could discuss the plot, which is as thick as a dictionary, but 1000 words is not enough to encapsulate this fantastic movie.Jack Nicholson plays JJ Gittes in an understated, Bogart-type way, however he is still a difficult man to figure out. The film ends, fittingly, in Chinatown, where Gittes got his start in this business. We don't know what went wrong with him there, something hinted at while in bed with Dunaway's Mrs. Mulwray, but it must have been messy. The ending is a stunning payoff to what has transpired. It is unexpected and it is sad. Dunaway turns in a deceptively great performance as the tortured femme fatale. Notice her mannerisms whenever her father is brought up. First time viewers will cringe when they find out why she acts this way.Legendary director John Huston plays the father, Noah Cross, one of the most reprehensible characters in recent memory. You sense evil when he's on-screen and he is symbolic of the drought in L.A. The man is soulless and insane. Polanski brings together a great cast of stars and then unknowns to create an ever-unfolding plot that turns left when you expect a right. He even puts himself in the mix, taking a piece out of Gittes snoopy nose.It is also beautifully photographed, with golden daylights remembering a more golden age, and serene sunsets and nights. Underneath is the evil of murder, theft, and incest. Think of all of the elements. Its like a Hitchcock filmography of props: B/w photos, dead decoys, bi-focal glasses, water basins, broken taillights, the eye of a fish, bandaged nose, a sister, and a daughter. Jerry Goldsmith's musical score echoes loss and tragedy as everything comes to a rousing, murderous halt in CHINATOWN.(NOTE: This film should be seen in its widescreen format on video.

But La Motta is still able to feel victorious, in a smug, insane sort of way as he staggers away, barely able to talk, grins at Robinson and says \"You never knocked me down, Ray.\" This scene, for me, sums up the film. You see the best of the directing, editing, acting and special effects, combined with direct insight into La Motta's character. It is truly unforgettable.

So after winning about six fights in a row, all fighters are afraid to fight him and so his brother Joey (Joe Pesci) decides to take matters into his own hands and makes a deal behind his brother's back to help him get a shot at the title. He makes his brother fight an up-and-comer called Janiro. After his rather easy victory against Janiro, Jake finally gets a shot at the title which he wins. But after his fight, he seems to forget everything about his all his work-out and years of hard-work it took him to win the title and begins eating like there's no tomorrow.

This movie proves that films are just as important as something hanging on the wall. Scorsese brilliantly captures the life of boxer Jake LaMotta like few people that have been brought to life on screen. Robert DeNiro gives one of the best performances in film history. He plays LaMotta like a concert violinist in front of a sold out audience. DeNiro combined with Joe Pesci as LaMotta's younger brother and trainer Joey are a perfect combination. The cinematography just rips you to shreds and leaves you gasping for air. I never have seen a movie display raw emotion better than Raging Bull. After viewing this movie more than ten times the scenes inside the ring stand out more and more. They make Rocky's fight scenes look like your watching a cartoon. If you watch closely you can truly experience what the fighters are going through. The speed of the jabs, the pounding each fighter takes, the animalistic emotion that they draw upon. Scorsese includes so many jarring sound and visual effects in the fight scenes that make it so real you can smell the damn thing. And the blood. If this thing was ever colorized it might be the bloodiest movie ever. But it is not over used and misrepresented. It is needed to displayed the true violence that can exist in a boxing ring. Raging Bull is more than just about boxing. It covers spousal jealousy and abuse and it also shows the breakdown that they can cause in a person leading to self destruction. There are so many great shots that it almost becomes ridiculous. One of the best is the one with DeNiro on the ropes in a Christ like image with Sugar Ray Robinson just starring him down ready to crucify DeNiro with his fists. Unbelievable scene. Cathy Moriarty does a great job as LaMotta's wife Vicky and young Frank Vincent has the role as Salvy. Vincent and Pesci really go at it in one scene that leads to a funny shot when they are asked by the local mob boss to make up and be friends. Vincent would go on to be a main stay in most of Scorsese's movies. This movie displays so vividly how LaMotta's violent insides leaked over into his personal life and lead to his destruction. DeNiro rightfully deserved the Academy Award for this role. This is the first time he is asked to gain a large amount of weight as he also did in the 'Untouchables'. And, from reading interviews on how he gains the weight it doesn't sound as easy as you think for someone not used to being in that condition. When an actor is willing to give that much to a role (sorry Stallone you are a little late on this one but I appreciate the effort) you know you have something special.

The cinematography employs monochrome instead of colour, a great idea because it perfectly mirrors LaMotta's dark persona. LaMotta is depicted here as a confused and paranoid pugilist, the film chronicles his career all the way to the championship belt. DeNiro is so convincing as LaMotta, that I ask myself sometimes if the personality he assumed for Raging Bull was how he must have once been himself. Another amazing thing DeNiro's sheer determination to accurately portray LaMotta in his post-boxing days by adding on fifty pounds! Let's not forget, he trained hard just to achieve the envious physique of LaMotta IN his boxing days! Joe Pesci is perfectly suited to the role of LaMotta's brother and manager, Joey, a quick talking, foul-mouthed but defensive and loyal sibling (and perhaps the only person that is allowed to critcise Jake and get away with it). Cathy Moriarty excels as Vicki LaMotta, Jake's supportive, strong and tolerant wife.The movie is a classic example of near flawless film-making. Not only is the acting first rate, but the script, cinematography, direction and editing is also of the highest calibre. The screenplay is based on LaMotta's autobiography and of course that gives the dialogue a realistic and true to life feel. Elegant black and white enhances the already brilliant cinematography throughout the film, characterised by picturesque, static camera shots, sharply juxtaposed with the vibrant and kinetic camera work of the fight scenes. The quick, crisp editing to the boxing matches help accentuate the hectic, haphazard ambience of a real duel. Scorsese expertly creates some very tense moments throughout the film, such as the 'You're telling me all these answers Joey, but none of them are the right answer' bit and his use of slow motion at certain moments help convey LaMotta's interpretation of events, such as Vicki giving a normal, everyday goodbye kiss to a departing visitor, a sight that makes Jake immediately think that Vicki may be seeing that person behind his back.Raging Bull's greatest virtue of all is that it is never boring. Even when watching it again, you'll not come across one boring scene.

Robert DeNiro's weight gain for the late scenes in the film remain as a testament to his acting and performing ability. DeNiro does such an acting job in this that he makes me do something I never thought possible, he makes me hate Robert DeNiro. The \"hit me again\" scene is classic.

Perhaps he's right. However, he can boast of at least one film that comes awfully close to that olympian standard, Raging Bull. When Scorsese made Raging Bull, he was seriously thinking of it as a terminal work. He was going to end his career in Hollywood, move to Italy, and make documentaries about the lives of the saints. For better or worse,He chose not to. Still, retirement WAS seriously on his mind, and because of that, Scorsese poured all his thoughts, all his feelings, all of his knowledge of cinema into this, one of the most troubling- and unforgettable films- ever made. I believe that I have seen Raging Bull nearly a dozen times, and I see new meanings and surprising nuances in it every time. Here I can offer only a few comments, both of which are paradoxical. The first is that Raging Bull is a very violent film about love; the second is that it succeeds in portraying Jake Lamotta because it is just as much about Marty Scorsese as it is about Jake LaMotta. There are five love stories in Raging Bull. The first is the story of Joey Lamottas love for his dull-witted, stubborn, hot-tempered , 'crazy ' brother. The second is Vicky Lamottas equally passionate love for her brutish, insanely jealous husband.The third is the story of Jakes love of himself, which begins as a brutish, jealous, self-loathing, profoundly selfish love, and slowly and in a halting, confused way, becomes a very different self appraisal, the recognition that he is not an ANIMAL, but a man. The Fourth love is that of Marty Scorsese himself, both for the film medium and for the characters in his best films. The fifth may sound crazy, but I think it is present throughout the film. It is the love of God.It would take a lot more space than I have here, but I would assert that Raging Bull DOES NOT portray a world in which God is absent; God even loves someone as brutish, as short-sighted, as vulgar and as morally obtuse as Jake. Indeed , Scorsese has even claimed that Jake comes close to God without realizing it. My second claim is that Raging Bull is autobiographical. But, in a sense, almost all of Scorsese's films are, whether directly or indirectly. For me , Raging Bull is autobiographical in that Marty is, to a large extent, reflecting himself in Jake. Scorsese, the \"gangster-priest' is confessing his sins and exorcising his demons. In this way, he is inviting all of his viewers to undertake a similar act of self examination, confession, and exorcism. This is one ( but not the only one) of the reasons that Raging Bull ends with a quote from Johns Gospel and a dedication to Haig Manoogian, who taught Marty how to look into himself and see."}, {"rank": 159, "name": "Raging Bull", "movie_year": "1980", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "It is said that when the Amish women make a quilt they deliberately leave a flaw in it, under the worldview that only God could truly make something perfect. Fortunately of course, the flaw the Amish women choose to leave is something trivial not fatal.It is this analogy that I think of after viewing Martin Scorsese's RAGING BULL. The only problem is the flaw that Mr. Scorsese left in was akin to omitting an entire seam. And the quilt unravels.RAGING BULL is masterfully filmed, masterfully acted, and masterfully written. It is genius. But it lacks sympathy for the characters. The viewers are unable to make an emotional connection with the characters on the screen. Watching the story (viewing the art) is only half the requisite. Viewers should be allowed to experience the story (experience the art) via making an emotional connection.This was a fatal flaw. Interestingly the consequential question we are therefore led to ask is -- was the story of Jake LaMotta worth framing on the screen? Why or why not?

Each boxing-match is individually coreographed and edited. the camera moves in ways it never did before. The soundeffects are heartstopping.The story is based on the life of the boxing champion Jake La Motta... the meanest sunofabich ever to have played the main character in a film (at least in the 80's), honestly played by Robet De Niro who took method acting to new hights when he decided to get fit in order to play the boxer, and then gained 30.kg to play the older fatter Jake La Motta. He gives his best performance ever, as he is able to bring out the sympathetic side of this monster.But eventually its the story that moves us... about a boxer whose life consists of fighting, but his biggest fights are the ones fought outside the ring. A man that's filled with so much self destruction that he destroys not only himself but everyone around him, his brother, wife, family.... this film just works in so many layers.

The sequence in which Jake beats his opponent so hard that the poor fool just collapses is amazing. The crowning achievement is the final fight of Jake's career. When Sugar Ray Robinson raises his arm, Scorsese lets everything fly. We see Jake stagger against the ropes, we see the blood, we hear the punches, and we see the horror wash across Viki LaMotta's face. But that's all the boxing scenes, what is at the heart of the film is Jake's relationship with his brother Joey, and Jake's insecurities in life. He is not the most sympathetic person. He is violent, suspicious and stubborn. Through DeNiro's amazing performance we see LaMotta as a complex and tragic figure. The scene in the Florida jail cell toward the end of the film is powerful.

There is plenty of boxing in it, some of the best boxing scenes ever put onto celluloid, and the movie does follow his rise as a professional boxer.

Perhaps the view of the Old South is too idealistic, but keep in mind that Margaret Mitchell based the book on stories her parents and grandparents had told her.

Of course they were going to paint themselves as righteous, gallant, wonderful people so horribly wronged by the Yankees just because they owned darkies like cattle, and who was little Peggy to argue with them? That said, the movie is pretty good. Alas, I've only seen it on T.V. and VHS, so I haven't seen the full power of the scope, but I've gotten a hefty dose of it, I think. Many of the shots really are gorgeous, and some are quite powerful, too. The first time I saw ut, for some reason I was so affected by the scene where Scarlett is driving Melanie, Prissy, and baby horugh a field right after the rain storm. A rainbow is out and the sun is shining, but the field is bare and here and there are bloody corpses. \"The devestation!\" I thought that first time I saw it; I really haven't thought otherwise in the 5 or so times I've seen it since. While of course it was Selznick's picture and no one has ever argued with that, due credit must be given to the four directors (probably more) who worked on it for doing such a wonderful job in keeping the interest up through the whole four hours and doing such a great job at it, with only a few flagging-attention spots. Then there's the acting. Vivien Leigh is great; now I simply can't imagine anyone else as Scarlett. Bette Davis? Joan Crawford?? Norma Shearer??? Lucille Ball???? I just can't imagine any of them in the role when Leigh was so good. To be able to be flirtatious, sexy, bitchy, strong-willed, and a cry-baby, all equally well! She really brightens up the picture, and thank God for that; she's in every scene! Clark Gable is wonderfully wry and provides a light touch, welcomely recieved, to the more sudsy, cheesy parts. He and Leigh have marvelous chemistry, and he's very brave to be able to think he can tame her! He plays it wonderfully cool in the last scene, while Leigh, in a very rare low spot, resorts to surprsingly annoying and cheesy histrionics, though she probably was so sick of the long hours/months spent on this that she was just taking out her frustration the only way she knew how. Olivia De Havilland quietly plays the part of Melanie wonderfully; without calling attention to herself, she provides a solid anchor for Scarlett and just acts the part wonderfully. Leslie Howard is just dull as Ashley, but then maybe that was supposed to be the point, that Scarlett somehow was so convinced he was perfect that she failed to realize how wrong he was for her. Hattie McDaniel as Mammy is funny, but not in a demeaning way. She must have worked very ahrd not to appear to be your average, \"Yes, mas'r, I'se here\" black maid as they were being portrayed at the time, and succeeds wnderfully. Her performance was good enough to get an Oscar nomination, let alone the award, so that should say something! Prissy, on the other hand, is pretty demeaning, because all she does is wail and act stupid. No wonder Butterfly McQueen was ashamed of the role! If I were her, I'd become a recluse and never think of leaving my house. Yes, the view of slavery is over-simplified, but Peggy Mitchell's family's accounts of it probably were, too, as they didn't see anything wrong with it at all.Masterful performances for the most part, masterful direction, script, music, (Oh, the music!), cinemetography, scenery, and everything else is entirely masterful.

She obsessed about certain men, she was charming, and she was a good actress. I fell in love with Clark Gable after this film. He made me believe in my heart that underneath sarcasm there is a heart. Olivia De Havilland was breath taking as Melanie Hamilton and Leslie Howard was a perfect Ashley Wilkes. Hattie McDaniel very much deserved her Oscar for playing Mammy.

This film takes the viewer back to Civil War America so convincingly that you cannot help but be pulled into the world of Scarlett O'Hara.

It must be possible to do so: people have. Many bad movies are like that. We can debate how enjoyable this one was - it's always hard to tell, bleary-eyed, after four hours' viewing - but one fact beyond dispute, is that this is a bad movie.When it was first released the American Civil War was - just - within living memory of some of the audience. It obviously spoke to United States audiences of the day. (What exactly it said, I have no idea.) The universe is arranged so that whenever a movie does well in North America it does well everywhere else, and the same capricious forces of history that lifted \"Jaws\" from the level success to the level of freakish statistical anomaly did much the same thing to \"Gone with the Wind\". No other film in history can touch it. No-one knows why.The truth is it was cranked out in a hurry. The artists responsible were skilled and a few of them achieved great things, so it's not as ineptly put together as many other bloated successes; but there was little time for reflection; and no-one had the time to stand back and ask themselves just what the movie was meant to be about, anyway. The best way of describing the plot is this: a lot of stuff happens to Scarlet O'Hara. The illusion can be maintained in the first two hours or so that it's all going somewhere. It isn't. More and still more stuff happens until we drown in it. The concluding scene, I feel, is only contingently the concluding scene; half a dozen or so earlier scenes would have done just as well. A point was reached where no real ending was possible. Any conclusion would look like a conclusion only by implicitly dismissing most of the previous footage as irrelevant.Apart from length and colours that make my eyes hurt there's no intrinsic quality that could have stunned the audiences of 1939 into submission. (It MUST have been the memory of the Civil War.) The acting is surprisingly bad in places - the early barbecue scene, and indeed most scenes lacking Clark Gable, are neither stylish nor convincing; and, in most moods, hard to sit through. Set design and art direction - all that type of thing - is good in places but inconsistent. The music soars but it too shows signs of being cranked out here and there. (And was it ever: Max Steiner had to dope himself in order to stay awake for the weeks it took to compose.) All in all the memorable moments are exactly as many as the workings of chance would lead you to expect - no more."}, {"rank": 160, "name": "Gone with the Wind", "movie_year": "1939", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn!\" This is perhaps one of the best movies ever made. But, it is only for us girls. My boyfriend would be so bored. Vivian Leigh plays the most memorable character I have ever seen. Scarlett O'Hara is the most complex woman I have ever seen on screen. Director Fleming shows us the world through Leigh's eyes, and we are taken through fire, war, death, broken promises, betrayal, and lost love. Tara is a mystic place, filled with everything you could go through living in a small town. Gable and Leigh give the best performances, Gable should have gotten the Oscar for his performance as stubborn Rhett. Sometimes you want to hug Scarlett, other times you want to slap her!

They shouldn't.When I saw AFI's top 100 all-time classics, I thought that it would be second after Casablanca or even maybe vice-versa but when I saw that \"The godfather\" was third before \"Gone with the wind\", I thought \"Maybe it's a little over-rated\" and when I did see it, I thought \"This is over-rated\".

Ashley Wilkes constantly refers to a (Southern) gentleman's code of honour in contrast to those marauding Yankees. The beauty and elegance of Tara is reduced to a wasteland caused the devastation of the Civil War. In other words, the film mourns a past that can never be recaptured.As this film was released in 1939, I wonder whether this film was mirroring the anxieties that existed on the eve of the 2nd World War, when the threat of the possible destruction of civilisation was looming on the horizon?"}, {"rank": 160, "name": "Gone with the Wind", "movie_year": "1939", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Weren't those the GOOD old days. 1939 was a year where virtually no TV was around with shows that pollute the mind, and isn't that GOOD?

My plot summary would be something like: a narcissistic, vain, manipulative woman whines her way through hardship before finding success in exploiting other people, then finally getting hers in the end. Vivian Leigh just reminded me of too many ex-girlfriends of mine and the lessons of the movie I felt were wretched (maybe I'm just not enough of a capitalist, but I generally don't have a positive view of professional widows or other people who feed on the misery of others).The one thing I do readily agree with is that this movie is fantastically filmed, considering the time period and that the whole thing was shot in California, and I'll never forget that painful scene with the veterans in Atlanta.

Rated PG.TagLineThe most magnificent picture ever!Back Cover\"Without Serious Rivals As America's Most Popular Film. Enormous In Every Way.\" - Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times.David O. Selznick's production of Margarat Mitchell's Pulitzer Prize winner Gone With The Wind is \"the pinnacle of Hollywood moviemaking\" Leonard Maltin of Entertainment Tonight said. And in Maltin's view, \"it looks better than it has in years.\" This sweeping Civil War - era romance won an impressive 10 Academy Awards (including Best Picture), and its immortal characters Scarlett (Vivien Leigh), Rhett (Clark Gable),Ashley (Leslie Howard), Melanie (Olivia de Havilland),Mammy (Hattie McDaniel) and Prissy (Butterfly McQueen) populate an epic story of enduring appeal across generations. Judged by many to be the greatest movie of all time, Gone With The Wind now comes home in its best video edition ever!"}, {"rank": 160, "name": "Gone with the Wind", "movie_year": "1939", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "I loved the movie.I'm from Georgia and am having a problem finding web sites for location shots in Georgia.I would like to visit some of them.Since I'm from Ga. this is embarrassing but if anyone knows of some sites for me to check out please leave a comment.Thanks"}, {"rank": 160, "name": "Gone with the Wind", "movie_year": "1939", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "having made my way through the book first, i think this a very brave interpretation, and even though it was that length, there was quite a bit missing from the book...it also concentrated a little more on the relationship between Rhett and Scarlett, not that I minded at all, some of the people who have bagged this movie , I think, do not appreciate that it is 59 years old, so there is obviously room for improvement, and I enjoyed it more than Titanic.There were some clever twists which I did not pick up the first time around...

Hattie McDaniel is the actress that did the unthinkable; she upstaged Vivian Leigh in almost every scene the two actresses shared.The movie, being nearly 60 years old, still holds up to today's standards of excellence.

She played in Hitchcock's classic \"Rear window\" and she won an Oscar for best actress in \"The country girl\" and most people tend to forget that she starred in yet another classic, \"Dial M for murder\". Starring Grace Kelly, Ray Milland, and Robert Cummings, it is simply one of Hitchcock's finest movies of all-time. In fact, I would consider it to be my second favorite Hitchcock movie ever, my first being \"Psycho\" (although I haven't seen \"Rear window\" yet). Margot (Grace Kelly) is married to Tony Wendice (Ray Milland), an ex-tennis player. However, she has been seeing another man named Mark Halliday (Robert Cummings). Mark writes crime stories. The two of them think that Tony doesn't know about their relationship but they're wrong; Tony has known about this relationship for one year and seems to have had enough of it. So when Mark, who lives in New-York, comes to London to see Margot, Tony wants to go out with Mark and his wife. But the night of the event, Tony is unable to go. So he tells Margot to take Mark out and to have a good time. The only problem is that Tony doesn't really have something that's keeping him from going out with Margot and Mark. He has another plan, the plan being to blackmail one of his old college friends that has become a small time crook into murdering his wife. What follows this is pure entertainment at its best. As usual, Hitchcock masterfully directs this movie and has the right actors to do the job. Ray Milland and Grace Kelly deliver very good performances and surprisingly enough, Robert Cummings does a rather good job in his role of Mark Halliday, the American crime novel writer who accidentally stumbles on the answer. But it is John Williams who steals the show with his great performance as Inspector Hubbard, the detective who holds the key to the whole mistery. He is simply excellent and pretty funny when he is supposed to be. Another of his great performances is in \"Witness for the prosecution\" where he played Brogan Moore, Charles Laughton's very good friend and seconding lawyer in the case. As for \"Dial M for murder\", well it's one of those movies that anyone should see at pretty much any cost."}, {"rank": 161, "name": "Dial M for Murder", "movie_year": "1954", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "DIAL M FOR MURDER is no masterpiece - its source material, though amusing is too mechanical and obvious, with an unravelling that is disappointingly implausible. Grace Kelly is a terrible actress, but she doesn't even have the crutch of her legendary beauty here, as her humiliation goes hand in hand with increasing dowdiness. And yet the film is a must-see: not only because every Hitchcock film is rich in style and meaning, but for two cherishable performances from Ray Milland and John Williams; for an extraordinary, abstract courtroom scene; and for a remarkable play with theatrical metaphors.Robin Wood sees many Hitchcock films as analyses of marriage, and DIAL M FOR MURDER is no exception. Even from the beginning we know there's something wrong with the Wendice union - the opening clench is theatrical, cold, unreal. The family home is not comforting, but made strange: objects don't blend in, but are threateningly present (lamps, drinks bottles etc.), always getting in the way of human communication (the telephone is an apt metaphor for the crisis in the film). In a traditional detective story, it is through the displacement of ordinary items, taken for granted, that marks a rupture - the everyday becomes frightening.Wendice is unable to satisfy his wife - he is only interested in her money. when he talks to Swan about his marital difficulties, he walks with a cane, ostensibly a fake prop, but a clear hint of the impotence rejected when he drops it and talks of the murder that will reassert his patriarchal role. He is like a servant in his own home, dependent on his wife, serving her and her lover drinks. He is probably gay - the handbag which has been transferred in association from his wife to him, is made the butt of a homophobic jibe by Inspector Hubbard.Most importantly, the conjugal home resembles a stage set. This is the governing motif of the film. Hitchcock subverts the hokey sentiments and values of Knott's play, by drawing attention to its staginess. Props are foregrounded; Wendice is clearly a stage director/author who is putting on a play (planning the murder of his wife). He talks to Swan like he's a director instructing an actor, giving him his lines, showing him round the stage, telling him what to do, where to move; crucially, giving him his cue, timing, the 'call'.However, although Wendice seems in control, the gaze of the film does not belong to him - his authority is already undermined long before his plot unravels. Frequently filmed in distanceng wide angle, this scene with Swan is shot from above, spied on from a seemingly unmotivated, godlike position, which only emhasises the unreality (theatricality) of the sequence. There is another author beyond Wendice, who is really running the play. Is it God? Fate? Hubris? This position of authority is jostled for by the four male characters, in a frequently homoerotic manner.The only time this kind of shot becomes motivated, it belongs to the Inspector, suggesting that the law is the godlike arbiter, from whom nothing can be hidden. And this is true, but not reassuring: the Inspector is cold and detached; but, more unforgiveably, like the other male characters, two of whom tried to murder her, he sadistically inflicts pain on Mrs. Wendice, pushing her out of the story, in effect succeeding where Wendice and Swan failed; she is absent for most of the film's second half. The law is shown to be both frightening and whimsical, rather like an Old Testament God. This is not comforting.This link between the author and authority, both trying to shape meaning, and 'create' truth, while in reality concealing it (Hubbard's assertion of patriarchal truth denies Mrs. Wendice's emotional reality) is linked to a story which is invoked in the film's opening MacGuffin, the stolen letter. Poe, a favourite of Hitchcock's, wrote 'The Purloined Letter' about a missive stolen by a respectable government minister, form a Queen possibly enjoying an adulterous relationship. What's written in this letter, and who controls it, becomes a site of power between the two male characters, who squeeze out the female character, who owns it, altogether. Knowledge, authority, power, and the artist are linked, all are abused, all are stolen from women. Mrs. Wendice's absence in the middle of the film is the anguish seething behind the film's (or play's) smooth mechanics. Anyone who thinks Hitchcock is just a technician is an idiot. he had a profound grasp on the workings of society, and how people are sacrificed for it.He also shows the seductive appeal of power - Wendice is suave, hilarious, imperious, mandarin, the motor of the film, a joy to watch, and yet an automaton. Hubbard's victory over him relies on Wendice's working like clockwork. The author was really only an actor, parroting perfectly his fed lines. It's significant that it should be a real author who exposes him."}, {"rank": 161, "name": "Dial M for Murder", "movie_year": "1954", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "This Hitchcock film reminds us just how much imagination can do to scare you.

This one is my favorite. \"Rear Window\" and objectively speaking probably half a dozen others are better but this film is for me. Ray Milland plays a tennis player in the cruel old days when it was not good enough to be good at something. His wife got the money. Grace Kelly did not need much acting talent to play a boring woman but this is not why Ray wants to get rid of her. She falls in love with another man - Ray Cummings of all people. This casting is of course the reason why this film works. We are supposed to sympathize with the greedy husband and at the same time the wife has to be an angel. Very difficult but Hitchcock succeeds. And mainly because we cannot forgive her for even thinking of giving up her husband for a man like him. Still, at the crucial time when she is about to be strangled our sympathies shift to her. We want her to reach the scissors.And then we admire Ray Milland again and hope he will make it. His eyes are the most wonderful thing in the movies. It is a great pity that he played only in a few good ones even after \"Lost Weekend\". This is one of the few thrillers that can be watched over and over again. One drawback of course is that after a while you start thinking about the acting and the great directing and the simple pleasure of watching a good movie shifts to the background. This is true for all great films except for the greatest of them all like GWTW or \"Thief of Bagdad\" that can be watched a hundred times and still be seen like the first time -where you just enjoy the story."}, {"rank": 161, "name": "Dial M for Murder", "movie_year": "1954", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Travel back to a time when. . a lanky actor like Ray Milland could be cast as a jock! . even if they weren't particularly reflective, women knew how to move in a dress!! . & policemen had a healthy sense of irony and Really Nice Manners!!!Listen to your heart pound as events unfold to a cheerily ominous soundtrack!See the British condescend to Americans. . and Americans trying to act British!

Grace Kelly is wasted in a passive, weak, and vapid role which relegates her to the status of window dressing (not that there is anything wrong with that!), she might as well be a nice looking piece of furniture in this movie. The Cummings role is wasted as the passion between him and Kelly is not developed, and amazingly, the tension that would exist between Milland and Cummings is never apparent!. This guy was sleeping with Milland's wife, but you would think they were best friends. What a waste. Would have been a lot more interesting if Kelly and Cummings were not such bland, cardboard harmless people and were a little more human, with real emotions (jealousy, hatred, passion, even a little evil).Milland makes the move interesting to watch as he sets his plan in motion with great charm and flair. Unfortunately, as he is the only interesting character, you kind of feel bad when he is caught in the end and the two sappy characters prevail.

But despite this I became literally addicted to it. To begin with my wife got pretty annoyed because any other movie we rented would be ejected after about 20 minutes of viewing and in would go LS&2SB. Now she is hooked as well.I have lost count of the number of times I have seen LS&2SB and still cannot put my finger on why I find this movie so good to watch. I suppose the most obvious feature of this movie is that it is beautifully balanced between being serious and humorous at the same time. The characters are two-dimensional. The villains are menacing, and yet they are made to look like idiots, and the good guys think they are so smart yet keep getting the rug pulled from under them. They are all projected as 'cool' yet the situation is always out of their control. Maybe it could be called a satire on true life.The style of this movie is unique, full stop. I cannot think of any movie that can be compared to LS&2SB. Quite a few people say that the style is a mix of 'Pulp Fiction', 'Goodfellas', 'Trainspotting' and 'Reservoir Dogs', but I think that you would make that kind of description only if you are really desperate to match LS&2SB to something.The best description I can think of is 'MTV does a crime comedy', and I honestly don't think there is anything wrong with that. Like music videos, it is all non-stop movement and sound. Something is always happening but unlike music videos, not without reason.The humor is incredibly sharp yet 'as a matter of fact'. No one is really trying to be extraordinarily funny, but again it is the balance between being menacingly serious and funny that the humor really flies at you. I think that it is for this reason that a few people are really disappointed with LS&2SB. If you are expecting a 'belly laugh Leslie Nielson, Jim Carrey, Steve Martin, typecasted' type all out comedy, or a serious 'Al Pacino, Andy Garcia, DeNiro typecasted crime thriller, you will find this movie a big let down.My favorite characters are Rory Breaker (Vas Blackwood) and Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) mainly because their two dimensional over-the-top characters are the most obvious. Big Chris takes his son with him debt collecting, and while he beats up someone who owes chastises him for swearing in front of his son and Rory Breaker is the most idiotic drug-lord you could come up with.I haven't even mentioned the excellent and unique camerawork, speaker blowing soundtrack, beautifully threaded plot, perfect ending and the grittiest visuals I've seen. You wont see any reflective glass laden sky scrapers here, or 'over head city shots', or incredible special effects. This movie has actors I have never heard of, dialogues that you have to rewind and replay to understand, buildings that look as though they have been condemned for demolition, cars that wouldn't even be seen in our scrap yards, has probably been made with a budget that most movies in Hollywood use for make-up alone, has no love scenes, or romance or complex relationships, no Oscar-worthy performances, and yet is perfect entertainment.Where our movies normally rely on budgets, this movie works on human talent alone.If any movie deserves a 10 out of 10, then this is it.'And there's one more thing...............it's been emotional'"}, {"rank": 162, "name": "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels", "movie_year": "1998", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "I've avoided this movie for sometime now.

Normally it is toned down to plain slap-stick goofy uncomplicated Inspector Cleuseau type humour tailored for American audiences.But to find not just British, but straight-faced East London cockney-slang and swear filled humour in a really stylish movie was a revelation.I have always believed that British humor, especially East London humor is much more sophisicated than American humour. Maybe the reason why American audiences have been more forthcoming with LS&2SB is that despite the accent, they finally 'get it' without having to have it remade into an American version, ala Faulty Towers and Threes company and other British comedies. Yet, I believe Tom Cruise is remaking the movie with an American cast. I suppose for those who just cannot understand English unless its spoken in an American accent. That is really a shame as there are so many diverse accents all around the world and LS&2SB could not have been done in any accent other than cockney.Still, there are bits only the British will get, like the scene with the three guys pouncing on the traffic warden in the back of the van. That scene had me clutching my sides. Only someone living in London can feel true loathing for a traffic warden, the most hated person in Britain.Cinemtography was superb. I wont go into who's already done the slow-mo's and stop action argument. It is near impossible to do anything in a movie today that has not already been done. You can either do nothing - or do whatever you can as long as it suits the mood and the flow of the movie, and Guy Ritchie just cannot be faulted. He projects the seedy, thin laned, miserable weathered London, yet with such style that you want to see more. The camera work could not have been better. Just see the projection of Eddy's unsteady, light-headed wooziness as he gets up from the gambling table having lost everything and owing even more. Brilliant.The Soundtrack was as diverse and yet brilliant as I have ever heard in a movie. I dont want to look like waving the Union Jack here, but this movie shows that the British have a more diverse taste in music. From Reggae, to Ska, to Rock, to Mikis Theodorakis every track played just added to the scene showed.In short, LS&2SB is a movie that just does not stop for a second, is full of refreshing humour, filmed with style, has a lively soundtrack, some violence thrown in for good measure, and a story with more twists and turns than a bowlfull of spaghetti.Dont let this movie slip you by. You'll either love it, or hate it.If this movie was not British, I'd give it an 8/10, but since it is, it gets 9/10 from me.Favourite dialogue: Rory Breaker: If you hold back anything, I'll kill ya. If you bend the truth or I think your bending the truth, I'll kill ya. If you forget anything I'll kill ya. In fact, you're gonna have to work very hard to stay alive, Nick.

Vinnie Jones is decently cast, but is given the idiotic role of a hitman who carries around his 12 year old son to \"teach him the ropes.\" The script is a mixture of robbery cliches, and Guy Ritchie displays minimal talent as a writer/director. Jason Flemying has the only watchable performance in the film as Tom. The soundtrack is good, but here's a tip Guy, a good soundtrack doesn't make a good movie.

Naturally, the fellow loses all his friends money, and then some. The guys then hatch a zany scheme to recoup their friends losses by carrying out a robbery.

The theme track that supplements the film is a lesson to the many directors who are yet to realise how to harness its value adding abilty.Art direction / cinematography is brilliant but one has to say that Guy owes a lot to Martin Scorcesse, from the card scene to car door scene (you'll understand when you see it), although this lacks his own imagination he does it very well, and he shows a lot of potential in this area.

This British comedy plunges us into a dizzying maelstrom of doublecrossing petty thieves, drug dealers, gamblers and assorted other criminal lowlifes whose paths cross in the streets and alleyways of London in clever and often fatal ways.The complex plot almost defies description. Suffice it to say the film focuses on a quartet of likable smalltime hoodlums who amass a decent stake from the fencing of stolen property and decide to risk it all on a high stakes card game with a notorious gangster named Henry, who has rigged the game, unbeknownst to Eddie, the cardsharp of the group. When Eddie loses the money, the stage is set for a wild series of plots, counterplots, crosses and double crosses, all executed by writer/director Guy Ritchie with a refreshing cinematic flair that includes frenetic pacing and editing, clever use of slow and fast motion photography, and barely perceptible freeze framing, all backed up by a dynamic score humming along on the soundtrack.As a writer, Ritchie fills the screen with a delighful gallery of eccentric, offbeat and slightly off-kilter characters. These are all too numerous to mention, but special note should be taken of Henry's chief henchman, Chris, who politely scolds his young son and partner in crime for his use of unseemly language as he bashes the brains out of one of Henry's delinquent customers or insists on his buckling up for safety as they take off on one of their wild rides through ths crime-infested streets of London.Despite it's '90's level of graphic violence, the film strikes echoes of classic British crime comedies of the gentler 1950's. It reminds one, in fact, of \"The Ladykillers\", wherein the bad crooks manage to eliminate each other through a maze of comic misunderstandings, leaving the \"good\" crooks thoughtfully untouched. Not that they don't learn their lesson, though, for, in the high stakes world of doubledealing criminals, our heroes discover that it takes a ruthless old pro to ultimately come out on top. And that's as it should be in the world of crime drama."}, {"rank": 162, "name": "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels", "movie_year": "1998", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Despite a decent plot and dialogue, this film did almost nothing for me with the exception of irritating me tremendously. Of the cast, at least three were blatant Steve Buscemi mimics while another might as well have been a contestant in a Dennis Leary wannabe contest. The characters seem to be overtly modeled, directly mind you, after characters from Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs. Overall the movie seemed like a weak attempt at matching Tarentino's genius character development from those films. Not to mention the less obvious Kubrick rip off with their version of Nadsat (the dialect used in Clockwork Orange). During one scene a bartender is telling a story using a dialect consisting of words meaning things other than their conventional definitions. While this definitely has potential, as Kubrick demonstrated, the director chose to use subtitles for the bartender's dialect so the audience would be better able to understand him. It could have been better if a similar dialect was used throughout the movie and the audience was forced to learn the language in order to understand the dialogue. Aside from these irritating facets of the movie, it was generally good. The plot shifts were creative as was the overall cinematography. I might have given it a 6 or 7 based on the plot, but because of the rip off characters and dialogue, I have to give it a 4.

Guy Ritchie, in his completely overrated and overdone debut, takes everything that made Pulp Fiction a great film, rubbed poop on it, and rewrapped it with interesting-looking directorial maneuvers that belong not on the silver screen but instead are meant to flop around in the cesspools of MTV. No wonder Ritchie won MTV's \"Best New Director\" award -- he copied thousands of music video tricks in order to pull off this boring, confusing, and banal heist movie. It has terrible acting, awful and forgettable writing, and a storyline that meanders and, at best, serves only to cause more disappointment when a new \"character\" is introduced or one of the many goons gives his theories of life.

Bizarrely wrapping its wraparound plot in this theme proves to add to the meticulously construed charm of elated supposed Britannian one-upmanship of the genre. The self-confidence shows in many of the film's more bizarrely shot (and somewhat overexposed) freeze-frames (most definitely the card game sequence in which one of our heroes loses a rigged poker run with a take-no-prisoners P.H. Moriarty). Terrifically essaying the very diction of Tarantino cloning through this veil of British influence turns out to be director Guy Ritchie's greatest asset.\"Lock\" is set primarily in a criminally arresting and somewhat grungily Nirvanian London, a place which looks almost clockwork in everpresent style. Bright red letters almost advertising the excessive seed in each district with their very simpleness (\"Harry's Sex Club\"), whirling advertisements of \"Minicabs\" and the almost libertine freedom of motion from Tim Maurice-Jones all help to create a flicker of \"never-seen-that-before!\" amazement pervading this environment. Inside this desmenes lie four \"mates\", one a cardsharp (Nick Moran), another a future entrepreneur (Tom Flemyng), a third named Bacon (Jason Strathem) and the fourth called \"Soap\" because unlike his three mates, he likes to keep his fingers clean by dabbling into a legitimate occupation, baking (Dexter Fletcher). Their initial efforts to get into a poker game with the infamous Hatchet Harry (Moriarty) end up in an enormous 500,000 pound debt to be vanquished within seven days--or else. As the Clash once said, \"one thing leads to another\", and soon enough the entire struggle leads to, of all things, the relentless exploits of a pair of \"smoking barrels\".Of course the ironic twists are one pleasure of the movie, but ironic twists does not equal charm, and this is the one of the things which \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" cannot equate with not only with its great-uncle \"Pulp Fiction\", but also its great-great grandparents which all contributed to Tarantino's film's fascinating pop-culture lore. One strength of the movie is its ability to juggle its various plotlines skillfully and still have time for a \"30 second rock interlude\" during its 108-minute running time. Indeed many of the characters elicit sympathy. One in particular is the moral thug Big Chris (Vinnie Jones) who takes his son on collecting missions and bashes his victims for swearing. These characters almost have a Dickensian feel to them in their grappling bond and ultimate fate. Hatchet Harry's back-up Barry the Baptist (Lenny McLean) reminds one of a cross between Clemenza and Don Rickles in his dogged, gleeful determination of collecting. And yet ultimately this film's sly, energetically automated sense of humor ultimately impairs one from sharing the same memories of the film's heroes, who all are so remarkably similar that they're sometimes hard to tell apart. Truly Ritchie's film is an unusual creation, and it deserves to be seen because of its out-of-left-field approach to the recent hip, Tarantino phase of filmmaking, but by strutting around the course when he should have been golfing for the hole, he prevents his film from breaking the cult masses like \"Pulp Fiction\" did and instead is seen as \"that egocentrically stylistic British entry into film reinvigoration\".

However maybe this is missing the point, maybe Guy Ritchie wanted the dialogue to sound like a bad Michael Caine film, there lies the joke, however I've got other criticisms.Lets look at some plot characteristics. A group of young, small time crooks. One of them upsets a big guy & has a contract on him, the action also revolves around a bar. Basically it's Mean Streets with a dope sub-plot & a happy ending.Also a major problem is the direction & camerawork. At time's the film turned from a film & attempted to experiment with editing & camerawork, this would be fine apart from the fact that nothing was experimental & looked more like a pop promo, this wasn't helped by a largely trendy soundtrack.So in sum shouldnt really have been in the cinema, MTV would have been a better place for it.

So with the obvious similarities aside, it is safe to say that Guy Ritchie's movie has brought new life and new twists to the genre, and succeeded where so many other clones have failed. Some of the reviews I read before seeing this movie complained of a plotline too complicated and dialogue too accent thick as hindrances to understanding the movie. Three things, first of all, don't underestimate the audience, I had no trouble following the plotline. Anyone who watches Seinfeld, with its separate plotlines coming together at the end, will get it. The accents I got used to quickly, Amercian audiences loved Trainspotting which had even thicker accents, so that's not a problem. Lastly, complete understanding of the plotline is secondary in a movie like this.

After seeing this movie, I was pleased, very very pleased! I think this movie is better and more exciting than the current #1 film at the box office, \"THE MATRIX.\" \"LOCK STOCK & TWO SMOKING BARRELS\" has different stories. They range from losing a huge bet during a poker game, two clumsy thieves stealing two antique shot-guns, a gang of young men figuring out on how to get 500,000 Pounds to a mob boss by Sunday, another gang planing on stealing money from weed dealers, and so on. This has been done many times, PULP FICTION is the most famous version, 2 DAYS IN THE VALLEY was the most underrated, and GO is the most recent. But what makes this film work? Simple, the characters, the stories, the rich dark humor, and the directing. You actually care about these characters, you wonder on what's going to happen to them next. I was amazed to see YOUNG SHERLOCK HOLMES Nichols Rowe on screen after not seeing him for almost 15 years. But if anyone stands out with their character or acting, it would be Vinnie Jones playing \"Big Chris\" the hit-man for the Mob Boss Harry \"Hatchet\" Lonsdale. He brings his son who's about ten years old along during his work, \"Big Chris\" even allows his son to watch him beat up on a person, but he won't allow him to swear or to blasphemy.

So why did I and so many others leg it to the shop on 1st March to buy Lock Stock and watch it over and over again? Many people will say that a film was \"pure entertainment\", and you should expect no more from an action movie. Well, nope, that's not what Lock Stock is about. What does it have then? It has a cast that give an authentic feel, if not Oscar winning performances. It has a black humour, a little overdone in places, but one that generally works well and seems to fit in with the characters and their location (i.e. you can only take cockney rhyming slang so seriously). It has a tugging, friendly plotline, that wrong foots your emotions once or twice and pokes you in the stomach, without ever *really* being twisty. It has an inconsiderate bass line, but only where your neighbours are concerned (it's great). It has Lenny McLean (RIP Lenny). It has an armoury of lines that you'll quote to your mates for weeks on end, to a point where they'll go out and buy the film just so they know what the hell you're talking about. It has the most unfair gunfight ever. It has so much more. Go see it and disagree with me.

If you are one the the many people who like low budget, good story lines, then don't miss \"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\". It has all the elements necessary to complete the quirky, comedic, dark script. You laugh at violence and howl at misfortune, one of the best I've seen in about 2 years, but you must like this type of movie to truly enjoy all of its oddities. I like to say that Pulp Fiction is a great movie I can't recommend because certain people can't get past the violence, but this movie is not as graphic. However, if you have trouble understanding cockney accents, it could be a tough watch. The accents didn't bother me, but I have always loved any accent from the United Kingdom. Make sure its your cup of tea before going, but I promise there will be no disappointment if you give it a chance.

It is so frustrating to see how the media have built it up so much that people are afraid to declare it a pile of poo, for fear of being uncool...I present my case thus: 1) the acting is almost uniformly dreadful - real school play stuff. Can anyone out there honestly say that this is otherwise? 2) the script is equally crap. The story is an amalgamation of every gangster film you've ever seen, totally unoriginal, and the characters are so jaw-droppingly cliched as to stagger belief!

I've seen more sophisticated humour in an episode of Sesame Street! 4) and the direction was way over the top - if you want to know how to be flash, Mr Ritchie, I suggest you go back and watch the real masters (again, since you so obviously pinched many bits straight from the likes of Scorsese..!).In conclusion, it's no points for LS&TSB, and a bottle of cider for the marketing men, who seemed to convince enough of you that this was a \"with it\" film.Cool?

He obviously has a visual flair, although, if \"Lock, Stock\" is anything to go by, originality isn't his strong point (the giddy scene taken directly from \"Mean Streets\"?).The story was at best old hat and at worst sketched in after the producers decided to make a good looking film about characters that we've all seen before, in situations that we've all seen before.None of this would be so bad if the British cinema-going public hadn't sapped it in and mistaken it for Film Art rather than Film Fart.The British Film Industry has long been accused of making too many 'pretty' period films, but this has to be a far more damning vacuous 'pretty postcard' of a film than any Merchant-Ivory production."}, {"rank": 162, "name": "Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels", "movie_year": "1998", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "What an ending... or did it end was there more after the credits..

It's fast paced, wittily scripted, brilliantly filmed and non-stop hilarious from beginning to end. It appears to be a send up of the whole gangster mentality but manages to be disturbingly realistic at the same time (I know - I've met characters like many of those depicted). The violence may seem over the top but is more in the \"Tom & Jerry\" mould than a typical big screen gore-fest. What's more, it's never dwelt on but simply adds to the overall effect of extremely dark comedy.The acting, especially from Nick Moran (Eddie) and PH Moriarty (Hatchett Harry) is top notch and Vinnie Jones is a revelation. Having seen him from just a few rows back on the football terraces, I've known for years that the man has a certain presence that demands your attention - even when he hasn't got another player's vitals in a vice-like grip! It's great to see that this has transferred onto the big screen where, yet again, it's difficult to keep your eyes off him, no matter who else is on the screen. Admittedly the role of Big Chris hardly stretched him but it's a start and it remains to be seen whether he'll ever tackle something more challenging (one of Shakespeare's many clowns would be interesting). Anyway, enough about Vinnie.The almost surreal humour of the film was brought to the fore in the barman's scene (played by Danny John-Jules of \"Red Dwarf\" fame). It was hard to know what to pay most attention to: the subtitles at the bottom of the screen or the scene being played out behind it. The overall effect was quite literally shockingly funny and for those not well versed in Cockney dialect (yes -it is an actual dialect) it's worth seeing again until you've mastered the language and can enjoy the full effect of the action.With a body count more akin to a Jacobean tragedy than a Hollywood blockbuster, and the black wit and class acting to match, \"Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels\" reminds me of Danny Boyle's early days directing for the Royal Shakespeare Company before he went on to bigger and better things (\"Shallow Grave\" & \"Trainspotting\"). I'm sure he and his regular crew of writers, camera men (sorry, should that be camera persons?) and actors would be proud to have made a film such as this, which I hope those who were involved would take as a compliment.Well, that's about it, I s'pose.

Nethertheless a Shakespearian body count mounts in some of the funniest shootouts since Tarantino's True Romance.There are about three heists going on at once, depending how you count them, and a father's bar is up for grabs, Lock Stock and Barrels. As for the smoking barrels, well two of the weapons used are antique.First time writer director Guy Ritchie has popped up with a slippery, garish black comedy with far more than its fair share of entertainment. Employing some non actors, including a rough edged sportsman (hard playing soccer star Vinnie Jones as Big Chris) and real life crooks (including Lenny McLean as Barry The Baptist) has helped to get that authentic edge no doubt, but a deep understanding of the genre was the real key. Ritchie patently knows how comedy gangster blood baths work.Sting is his usual credible self on screen as JD, Eddie's Dad and Lenny McLean sure knows how real life thugs operate. For a start, it appears that they only say what's necessary. Vinnie Jones as JD is big, quietly spoken, knows the rules of thuggery and is frighteningly ominous.It seems that sportsmen are basically entertainers at the highest level. Another top line soccer star, Eric Cantona, was equally impressive recently in Elizabeth, another top notch English film.

Despite the inevitable comparisons to Reservoir Dogs et al, this is a very British film which in general rejects the slick wit of Tarantino to play on its caricatured characters with a mixture of understatement, sarcasm and dark cockney humour, with the occasional slice of slap-stick comedy thrown in for good measure. The plot twists and turns engagingly backed by an excellent soundtrack, and the ending is a relief from standard Hollywood predictability.

Easily one of the best movies of the 1990s, TS captures a sense of realism that eludes big American studios. Most Americans choose to see the movie as a cautionary tale about heroin and drug use but this view misses the mark. All the heroin excesses of the movie's central characters, Renton, Spud, Sick-Boy, Tommy, etc., pale when compared to the alcoholic pyschopath Begbie. Trainspotting is really a very hard look at the shallowness and purposelessness of life in the `post-industrial' world. Using the old Scottish capital, Edinburgh, as its principal backdrop, TS touches on all aspects of post-Thatcher Britain, from unemployment, urban decay, welfare, Aids, to drugs, sex, and pornography, as seen in the lives of a group of Scottish youths. The movie is about surviving in the late 20th Century world.The performances by all are superb. Ewan MacGregor is spectacular as the movie's chief protagonist, and even the smallest roles are well acted. Throughout TS, the use of music, locales, flash-backs, and voice-over narration, is well conceived and creates a gritty pace. The extreme realism is achieved by a surrealistic use of shock, humor, and mood. There are both truly shocking and very funny moments in this movie.

It just shows the reasons behind and consequences of heroin abuse, and that is that. Ewan McGregor is such a charming presence here, even as he goes through danky Scotland, stealing money for drugs or drugs from the hospital to trade in for money to get more drugs. Heroin is, it seems, a delictable favorite. But only because the high is so extraordinary, you don't want to come down, so you go back and forth. Addicted to it.McGregor's Renton is the flawed hero of the movie who can't get off the smack habit no matter how PAINFULLY hard he tries. He's in great company of lowlifes. The equally charismatic Johnny Lee Miller plays Sick Boy, a suave James Bond fan who puts money over his friends any time. Robert Carlyle as Begbie, a beer-swilling hothead who gets high on violence rather than heroin (he's an echo of Alex from A CLOCKWORK ORANGE). Ewen Bremner as Spud, the nerdy follower who is the most luckless of the clan. Kevin McKidd as Tommy, the clean jock-type who strange enough hangs with this group of misfits even though he doesn't do drugs. Kelly MacDonald (in her first movie role) as a temptress schoolgirl who falls for Renton and is as smart as she is unusually mature.Danny Boyle gives us some very funny and psychedelic moments in this cult fave, all under thumping beats of techno and new wave British pop music. But at the same time he raises some poignant thoughts. Renton tells us to choose life, a job, a big television, washing machines, a big couch to sit on and watch mindnumbing, spirit-crushing game shows.

Yet despite its obvious and successful attempts at humor, Trainspotting is a serious movie about friends and the types of friends you hang on to, growing up Scottish as a Heroin junkie, and the life of the lower middleclass. In Mark Renton's case, Sickboy (a Sean Connery wannabe), Spud (a quiet but baffled man), Begbie (over-aggressive warmonger)are the problem. The issue of drugs is the counterpoint to that problem brought to light by his friends. With friends like his, he could never be more than what they were -drug addicts and remorseless street trash. Ultimately his attempts to quit Heroin, stay clean, get a job, and lead a normal life are dashed by his mates until he comes up with a plan: The Last Hit, so to speak.

We all know how the overuse and dependency of drugs can destroy a life, the gripping struggle many endure to pull themselves out of that toilet, and the ruin they can bring to others around them. But Trainspotting is a movie that shows more than just the dark travails of this ugly trip as the movie 'Basketball Diaries' does to excruciating detail. It reaffirms why life, as is wonderfully described in a Dylan like way by Ewan McGregor in the beginning of the movie, is worth living. What separates this movie and elevates it from other movies that cover this same tone and subject material is that the main character is not totally destroyed and left in a dark hopeless state at the end just to emphasize the why you shouldn't do drugs lesson. The movie ends with great hope and answers McGregor's own opening question of why choose life. And I will say emphatically again it is one hell of a ride. We follow McGregor and his excellently casted mates through all the stages of drug abuse and the Alice in Wonderland like adventures that follow it. Robert Carlye played the volatile Francis Begbie to an Oscar like perfection. His outburst struck me like a dark comedy where you almost hate to laugh but your true honesty leaves you no choice. Definitely one of the most memorable characters from a movie in the 90's. From drug dens to night clubs the cast mixes so well. The humor bounces wildly off the wall like something you get out of a gum ball machine. You never know when it will jump out in front of you so be ready. Danny Boyle deserves a great nod and a raise of the glass for a directing job well done. He chooses shots from great angles and adds all kinds of perfectly captured perks as well. One of my favorite scenes is the shot from the floor as McGregor has just taken a large hit of heroin. He proceeds to sink into a large red rug right through the floor. Every proceeding shot is from this unusual point of view until he is brought out of his dazed state at a local hospital. For someone who has never done heroin (and doesn't particularly plan to) this is one of the feelings I can imagine the drug delivering me to as I watch McGregor dip into the floor. That folks is a sign of a good director. When you have a camera in your hands and you want to have the audience truly feel what something is like why just tell them? Too easy and makes for a dull movie. Which is an incurable disease eighty percent of filmmakers have today. Show them dammit!! Use your imagination and create uniqueness. Make your movie stand out. The soundtrack compliments Trainspotting to a tee and adds to the movie's slick electric settings and rich cinematography. The only slight problem with the movie is that at times some of the Scottish accents get as thick as something out of a broken espresso machine. You will find yourself trying to understand what the hell is being said but just pay attention to what is going on within the scene and you will make it through with flying colors. This movie was not what I expected. It thrilled me in many different ways and added new life to subject material that I am sure hasn't seen the last foot tracks come its way."}, {"rank": 167, "name": "Trainspotting", "movie_year": "1996", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Of course \"Trainspotting\" is a disturbing film. It is also gross and disgusting, as though Larry Flynt had gotten his hands on something like \"A Clockwork Orange.\" But this Brit production with the heavy Scottish brogue is fortunately more than that; it is original and clever and moves right along. This is partly a cult film with all sorts of indie shibboleths and counter-cultural references; and partly an art film, with splashy sets and studied camera work; but mostly this is a full-blown commercial seduction of contemporary youth, worthy of the talent of somebody at, say, Sony or Pepsi or even the WB.The opening theme (actually voiced over) is the idea that heroin or any really demanding addiction is preferable to ordinary life, an intriguing but stale notion designed to shock the bourgeoisie. The central theme proclaims that a heroin addict is just another kind of junkie, along with your cigarette, cola, beer, sex, grease, etc. junkies. (Bingo!) Yet at the end we see, as one might discover by watching PBS, that money will out. Kinda reminds me of what Omar Khayyam asked about wine nine hundred years ago: \"I wonder...what the Vintners buy/One half so precious as the stuff they sell.\"Here the answer is clear: money itself. Closing theme: money triumphs over heroin; money is the power god of heroin.I guess something like that is the commercially correct \"message\" of this film.Ewan McGregor is excellent in the leading role as a junkie who is as cute as your brother, with fine support by Robert Carlyle, who plays a bantam who likes to cut people. The script by John Hodge is partly unintelligible, which is good; and the direction by Danny Boyle combines cartoon fantasy with stark realism, slick horror with black comedy, in a manner sure to be imitated. The sound track, \"available on Capitol Records,\" (I rest my case) will sell. Some might say that this is a penetrating critique of modern urban society, but the only thing being penetrated is your pocket book.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book \"Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!\" Get it at Amazon!)"}, {"rank": 167, "name": "Trainspotting", "movie_year": "1996", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "In the beginning you feel like watching a depressive drug-related film which will bore you short-after.

My Brit friends tell me that the term \"trainspotting\" is shorthand for \"losers,\" and that is of course what these guys are. But as Renton explains throughout the film, aside from the pleasure of smack, it offers direction and purpose. When you're on skag, your life becomes very structured: fix, and then figure out how to get another fix. It's no different than people who go to law school or get business degrees: it provides them a means to structure their life.

It remains, after having seen it a second time recently, one of the most powerful experiences I have had with a motion picture.No doubt many have already spoken about what they liked about \"Trainspotting\": the dialogue, the rhythm of the photography and editing, Robert Carlyle's miraculous performance. Now, I'd like to say a few words about the soundtrack.The music makes or breaks the film. The best films have had the best music. Legends, such as \"Casablanca\", \"Citizen Kane\", and \"Gone With the Wind\", have had equally legendary music and music scores. Hitchcock realized the fundamental importance of music as the augmentor of moods and emotions, in a countless number of his works. Martin Scorsese, the master of soundtrack selection, realized the same. Last year, two seperate films, \"The Thin Red Line\" and \"Pi\", worked extremely well thanks partly to their music scores from composers who couldn't be more different: Hans Zimmer and Massive Attack.

The prisoners are badly treated by cruel guards... The camp commander is a rigid psychopath... Conditions are hard to bear...

I was stunned by what I saw. How is it that such an awful movie came to be known as a classic? What disgusted me most about it was the portrayal of the arrogant British officer (played by Alec Guiness) as an admirable and principled hero. What makes him arrogant? Trying to use laws to exclude him from working with the \"grunts\". What made this even more ridiculous was that the soldiers still obeyed and respected him after his little protest.Another problem was the portrayal of the camp itself. The film sugar coats the real-life consequences POW's face for insubordination (there was not a single beating or execution in the entire film). I don't say this because I'm bloodthirsty, I say it because the lack of such violence trivializes the horrors of war.So in summing up, I watched Bridge On the River Kwai expecting something worthy of being called a classic.

Excellent performances (who plays a pompous englishman better than Guiness?) could not save this movie from its unintentional silliness."}, {"rank": 168, "name": "The Bridge on the River Kwai", "movie_year": "1957", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "I heard a film critic once say that there really aren't \"war movies\"; there are only \"anti-war\" movies. I'm still not sure what I think of that claim, but having seen - The Bridge on the River Kwai- enough times in the past several years, I think I'm persuaded that it's at least half right. -Kwai-, I believe, is both a \"war\" and \"anti-war\" movie, and, in my view, it succeeds admirably at both.There is almost no element of -Kwai- that is not praise-worthy. David Lean's direction is tight and evocative. The cinematography is great (even though the color seems increasingly drained in film versions that I have seen). The acting is top-notch. I honestly believe that this is Alec Guiness's best performance, and Sessue Hayakawa is also highly sympathetic and believable. William Holden and Jack Hawkins round out the cast nicely.The musical score is also right on. Simply put, -Kwai- is an excellently constructed film made by people who obviously cared a great deal about it. As a result, the viewer comes to care a great deal about it as well.Clearly -Kwai- is an anti-war film. There is no glorification here. War is brutal, period. It's brutality is not captured here in terms of gory carnage or senseless battles. Instead, the psychological dimension of brutality comes across clearly. Yet, -Kwai- also shows the resilience of the human spirit as well as its complexity. One is left wondering if participation in World War II not only psychologically brutalized the characters played by Guiness, Hayakawa, and Holden but also if it simultaneously uplifted them. The paradox is striking to me each time I view this film. War can act both as a positive and negative catalyst, and it can do both of these things at the same instant.So, is -The Bridge on the River Kwai- a war movie or an anti-war movie? I think Lean clearly preferred the latter, but the subject matter and his approach to it may have landed somewhere in between.Regardless, -Kwai- is a fantastic film experience and is not to be missed.

Another thing I don't understand is that when most people I know refer to \"The bridge on the river Kwai\", they only talk about the script and naturally, Lean's directing and Guinness's performance. I think that it is William Holden who steals the show and he didn't even get a nomination in it. His performance as Shears is absolutely incredible and totally convincing. The movie begins with an English platoon giving in to a Japanese prison camp in WWII on a Japanese island. When they arrive to the camp, their leader, Colonel Nicholson (Guinness) asks to see the chief of the camp. He is presented to Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) and announces to him that his platoon is surrendering. Colonel Saito tells Colonel Nicholson that his men will have to work hard to build a bridge that goes from one side to another of the river Kwai. Saito also tells him that if the men work hard, they will be treated well. This whole conversation takes place right before the American grave-digger, Shears (Holden), held prisoner by the Japanese. He also witnesses a little scene where Nicholson comes incredibly close to getting shot and so he understands just how hard-headed he is. But Shears's only goal is to escape and that he does. After his escape, Shears accidentally hooks up with Major Warden (Jack Hawkins) who he doesn't know. However, Warden, with the help of Nicholson's private work in the prison camp, knows a lot about Shears. He explains to Shears that Nicholson is one of his men and that his platoon surrendered because that's what Warden had ordered Nicholson to do. He also tells Shears that he gave that order because he knew about Saito's plan to build a bridge and that Nicholson's mission was to (WARNING: SPOILER) blow-up the bridge when the Japanese train which contains the ammunitions and weapons is passing on it. And since Shears was able to escape from the camp, Warden convinces him to help him get close to the prison camp to set-up the explosives. \"The bridge on the river Kwai\" is a gripping, flawless movie and even though I said that Holden nearly steals the show with his performance as Shears, Guinness's performance is excellent as well. Hawkins delivers a great performance as well and Lean's directing is nothing else than perfect. He seems to have that touch of being able to make three to four hours long movies without boring the viewer. \"The bridge on the river Kwai\" was ranked #13 on AFI's list of their 100 all-time best movies which is exactly the rank it deserved.

Then we see some more of the brutalities of war. Then we see the credits.) Or how about this: a humble American soldier, with the pragmatism native to his breed, rejects his superiors' highfalutin talk of honour and glory and asserts his basic humanity in trying to stay alive. Or this one: we see English prisoners of war maintain their dignity in the face of Japanese brutality.They're all present, in a sort of a way: but ALSO present is a magnificent, long, suspenseful, tight story, around which these apparent clich\u00e9s wrap naturally. If the clich\u00e9s don't wrap naturally then they, not the story, are bent out of shape.

Many may compare it to the more recent Saving Private Ryan, but the two films have completely different lessons. Bridge is about the absurdity of war and the irrationality of those who fight, whereas Ryan is about the way in which brave men deal with the horrors of war, and the debt owed by all of us for their sacrifice.This film shares many of the same undercurrents as another one of my personal Top Ten motion pictures, Planet of the Apes (1968). I was surprised to recently learn that both films are based on novels by the same French writer, Pierre Boulle.

The Cinematography, which also won an Academy Award, is beautiful (If you purchase this video, buy the widescreen. The formatted version does not capture the Cinematography as well.) The musical score by Malcolm Arnold is great (Malcolm Arnold received an Oscar for his score). The Screenplay is wonderful, and an amazing achievement considering two blacklisted writers were responsible for it. Both Carl Foreman and Michael Wilson won an Academy Award for their screenplay.OK, so much for awards, but the little things make this movie great. There are so many great lines and scenes throughout the movie. The movie never tries to show the Japanese as the bad guys (just the enemy in war), but shows their constant fight to maintain their code of honor. This is the ultimate struggle of the movie, can honor exist in war? The British fight to maintain their honor, and the Japanese try to force their code of honor onto the British prisoners. The movie has a message that should last through the ages.The final scene of the movie must be one of the greatest of all time. I will not give it away if anybody has not seen it, but when you do the final scene will blow you away, as will the movie."}, {"rank": 168, "name": "The Bridge on the River Kwai", "movie_year": "1957", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "I can freely admit that I don't watch many movies that weren't made in the past thirty years, mainly because I usually find them to be far too slow. This film proved to be an exception. While I did find it to take some time before it really got going, there were more than enough great moments to keep me watching with enthusiasm throughout. Everything about this film is first-rate, and there is no question that it deserved the armload of Oscars that it won over four decades ago. Now, I'm not going to say that it's one of the greatest films that I've ever seen, but I did feel that it was a very good film, and considering how I usually regard films made from this era, that is VERY high praise."}, {"rank": 168, "name": "The Bridge on the River Kwai", "movie_year": "1957", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Although I heard several times the quality of The Bridge on the River Kwai, no review can prepare you for the sheer jaw-dropping, absolute perfection that this movie is.The movie, set in World War II, begins with a pan down to a batallion of British soldiers whistling a very recognizable tune, and marching in step into a Japanese POW camp in the jungles of modern-day Burma. The camp is run by Colonel Saito, played by Sessue Hayakowa, a part-time artist and wine connoisseur, and full-time prison warden and sadist. Colonel Saito tells his captives, members of the Royal Armed Corps of Engineers, that they must build a rail bridge over the Kwai River, or be executed \"without honor\". He also orders the officers of the corps, led by Colonel Nicholson, played by Sir Alec Guiness, to assist in the manual labor. Colonel Nicholson resists, citing a book of the rules of warfare written by the League of Nations forbiding captured officers to serve manual labor. In honorable protest, they stand at full attention in a hunger strike for a full 24 hours until Colonel Saito relents.Colonel Nicholson goes to the construction site and realizes that the bridge should be built on more solid ground further downstream. He convinces Colonel Saito that they should build in another site. If his men are being forced to work, Nicholson argues, they will work to build the best possible construction. During the second construction, an American soldier Shears escapes the camp and ends up in Ceylon, a British Territory at the time. His British liberators use him and his knowledge of the project, and they assemble a small team to go back to the bridge to destroy it.And therein lies the conflict. In most movies, there is a person or group that you can \"root\" for without conviction, like the Americans in Saving Private Ryan. If you root for Shears and his team, they are destroying something that their countrymen slaved hard labor to build. Rooting for Nicholson means you are upholding the Japanese in their goal of expansion. Even Saito, although very brutal, is honorable. He fights and does what he does for his country, not his own glory. Honor is usually a virtue, but here it is a fatal flaw. The pointlessness of war becomes completely apparent. Pardon the cliche, but there are no winners in this movie, or in war, just degrees of losing. Two points drive this home. The first is Shears's exclaimation \"...you're all worrying about the proper way to die, when you should be worrying about the proper way to live!\" The second is after the bridge is completed, Colonel Nicholson gives a final lookover and sets a placard on the bridge that states that although it is under a Japanese flag, it was build by the hard work of the Royal Armed Corps of Engineers. The final end sequence is totally gripping, and one that you will never forget.This movie won 7 Oscars, and it deserved every one. Every element, the plot, acting, characterization, editing, is stunning. The cinematography of the jungle and the bridge itself is among the best ever, and is a real treat in widescreen. It's 2:45 running time will amaze you when you realize it after you are over, because it doesn't seem the least bit overlong. Even the visual effects do not seem dated, and it was made over 40 years ago. I don't give out 10's very often, but this movie more than earns it. There are absolutely no flaws in this movie, and is director David Lean's (Dr. Zhivago, Lawrence of Arabia) masterpiece and is truly timeless. A perfect movie that marries blockbuster entertainment with cinematic artistry, this should not be missed. And you'll be whistling that tune for days after seeing it."}, {"rank": 168, "name": "The Bridge on the River Kwai", "movie_year": "1957", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "This is a truly superb film. Whereas with pseudo-masterpieces like \"Saving Private Ryan\" and \"Apocalypse Now.\" the message is so rhetorical and one-sided, the film achieves what art is supposed to: create a beautiful work that illuminates the truths that cannot merely be put into words, but must be experienced. The complexity of the characters is amazing. Alec Guinness realizes that this bridge is not going to win the war for the Axis. The bridge will be built either way. But here's a chance to create something good, here's a way to preserve human dignity in inhuman conditions. When he gives that speech (\"Years from now, when people uses this bridge, they will know that it was built by soldiers, British soldiers, not slaves\") O my God, I get goosebumps."}, {"rank": 168, "name": "The Bridge on the River Kwai", "movie_year": "1957", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "I have watched this movie several times and it is just getting better and better all the time. Why? Because this movie actually has a message built-in, this isn't a violent story, like \"Saving Private Ryan\" - also a good movie with a message - but it is still not a slow story.When I last saw it, I realised that there was something in the movie that I had never understood, this isn't a movie about war, torture or how it was to be a prisoner of war; this is a movie about madness and pride. The pride shows both in Saiko and Colonel Nicholson, they are so full of it that it is almost impossible for them to come to a civil-conclusion with the problems they have with each other. The madness is shown in Colonel Nicholson and Holden's character - here they are, two prisoners of war and they don't want to help each other out, instead they try to reach separate goals, and they are both willing to die for it.After you have watched this movie one is amazed by the performances made by Alec Guinness and William Holden and I must say that this is therefore one of the best War/Drama movies ever made My vote? 9 out of 10 naturally."}, {"rank": 168, "name": "The Bridge on the River Kwai", "movie_year": "1957", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "I recently saw The Bridge on the River Kwai at the Cinerama Dome, and it was quite spectacular. Unlike some of today's grand adventure films, you get to know the characters along with seeing great scenes of acting and cinematography. Alec Guinness is at the top of his form as the single minded Colonel Nicholson. The scene between Nicholson and Saito in Saito's hut is remarkable. Nicholson still will not concede defeat, he even takes offense that other officers of different armies gave in and worked alongside the enlisted men. Saito can't understand Nicholson's acceptance of his punishment, and it drives him crazy. The film's plot has two stories that are beautifully intertwined. Shears' return to the bridge is his only way to escape the bridge. In the film's final act, the tension is turned up as the British commandos try to blow up the bridge, and a train, and only then does Nicholson realise what the bridge really is. The Bridge on the River Kwai is one film that is hard to top, the only film able to do that is Lawrence of Arabia, both directed by the meticulous eye of David Lean. One director who could put intimacy in epic circumstances."}, {"rank": 168, "name": "The Bridge on the River Kwai", "movie_year": "1957", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "This film is easily one of the ten best I have ever seen. It seems to have every aspect of what a film needs to be great. 1) Great story 2) Great actors 3) Great direction 4) Great cinematography 5) Great suspense 6) Great story speed. Director David Lean captured each of these elements to almost a perfect level in this anti-war film.Alec Guiness gives a great performance as Col. Nicholson and was indeed Oscar-worthy. The passion with which he had for the role is best shown at the conclusion of the film in which he finally realizes that all he had done was wrong. Performances from Holden, Hayakawa and Hawkins all match the level of Guiness' intensity. The whole conflict between the British and Japanese is never really described but one gets a better sense of it through the great performances.The one thing that really got me about this film was the manner in which it was shot. The picture quality is very much up to modern standards and seems all that more incredible when compared to other colour films of the day. Jack Hildyard's cinematography full captures the feeling of struggle and conquer throughout the film, especially in later scenes including the destruction of the bridge. Full credit to Boulle's book for coming up with such an interesting way to destroy the bridge.The visual and psychological complexities of this film make it truly great among all films, not just war films.

David Lean certainly had the eye of any modern director and managed to direct a visual masterpiece at a time when many films were still being shot in black and white. William Holden gives one of his finest performances as a cynic of warfare , citing for us the insanity and absurdity that the combatants often convey. And he hates the war, but he cannot avoid been thrown back into it again and again. We wish he could stay on the beach with his nurse lover, but he is a man destined for a tragic doom for his country, whether he wants to or not. Alec Guiness also delivers a fine performance as a bold general whose own pride is, at the same time, his most noble quality as well as his greatest fault. He is uncompromising, yet when the Japanese submit to his demands, he begins overseeing the construction of the bridge with great esteem. Eventually, for him, the bridge becomes a manifestation of his belief of the superiority of the British Army, which he follows like a religion. And in putting all his pride into this bridge, he loses sight of even the British's own true agenda. Truly, his sense of overwhelming honor is, at the same time, his downfall in a descent to a loss of morality, and a sense of good and evil. And yes, by the end of this film, we learn a great lesson of the horrors of war. Not only does it take the lives of many good men, but the utter failure and despair that accompany it make it an unbearable existence. And this message has only recently been re-evaluated with the also-brilliant masterpiece \"Saving Private Ryan.\" But, keep in mind that it took forty years to regain the power that this film inspired so long ago."}, {"rank": 168, "name": "The Bridge on the River Kwai", "movie_year": "1957", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Bridge on the River Kwai is absolutely one of the greatest movies I've had the pleasure of seeing.

Jerry Lundegaard (the brilliant William H.

The plot thickens, twists and turns, in the Coen`s inimitable way.My favourite film of the 90`s so far, Fargo is a black comedy \"stroke\" thriller, which is hard to dismiss. Its true to life story, beautiful photography (thanks to Roger Deakins), wonderful characters, melancholy music, vivid script, and the way it captures the Minnesota way of life, is pure brilliance.

Like the best output of the Coen Brothers, this is a remarkable character study relying on dark humor and cold realism (no pun intended) in creating a complicated and troubled scene of human emotions, troubles, and motives. Its greatest success is in attributing each of its characters with a complexity of characteristics: each one can be liked in his or her own way, and each is presented with such realistic vision that the viewer is suspended in his predicaments.

Fargo is the kind of movie that make me love the cinema."}, {"rank": 170, "name": "Fargo", "movie_year": "1996", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "First of all, the title, \"Fargo\" is insignificant, that's just the name of the town where the story begins.And it's rated R for two short sex scenes and there's also a whole lotta swearing!I rented this thinking it'd be some intense thriller with comedy in it, anyway I guess I was expecting something else because the first time I saw it I didn't think it was all that great. But then I saw it again and Zingo!!! I love it! I even bought the soundtrack.It shows how going against the law and doing bad things just doesn't work. The movie says that greed will get you to awful places. Here's this guy, Jerry, who looks like he's doing okay, only he just wants more money. So he hires two crooks, who are don't mind breaking laws for money, to do something that puts his wife at a big risk! Weird old Jerry loves his money more than his wife. Sure, his wife's father, he's real well off. But he's a jerk, and is stubborn with his money. Then everything goes horribly wrong and people start dying and/or going to jail.And then there's the Gundersons, Marge and Norm. Real simple people who aren't rich and are expecting a child and they both work (Norm has a cooshy job at the post office and also enjoys painting, and Marge is a policewoman). Norm is a great husband, bringing Marge lunch or making her breakfast.By the end of the film you realize that these two folks are happy. And they're the only main characters that come across that way (There's some benign extras, too). All the crooks and jerks aren't happy, they're either mad or panicky or breaking laws and doing bad things and beating each other.Even Marge's old friend from high school isn't happy. Now I've heard some critics say that this guy, played by Steve Park from tv's \"in living color\", is just a part of an annoying pointless subplot. But this is actually just character development for Marge. She cares about him and his troubles, and is real sorry to hear about how things are for him, but when she finds out he was lying to get pity, she's real surprized. \"I just don't understand it\"\"I just don't understand it\" is one of the most powerful lines I've heard because how could nice ol' Margie understand all these crooked shenanegans when she knows the truth about things and about getting happiness. Happiness isn't a little money, it's finding someone you love and maybe having a family and not having to run away from the law all the time.I noticed that some of the parts with the \"nice people\" were kinda boring. Maybe that's to show that these people may be boring, but at least they're not going to get shot or caught by cops or have guilty consciences or anything, so that's fine.Needless to say, it's one of my favorites, and if for any reason you don't like R rated movies, just watch the TNT version--that one's just fine."}, {"rank": 170, "name": "Fargo", "movie_year": "1996", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "I really liked this movie.

To truly appreciate the accuracy of the screenplay and performances in Fargo you should visit North Dakota or Western Canada someday. I'm sure you'll laugh if you happen to overhear the smalltalk (it's pretty darn cold eh).

The gore at the end is as much as people say and once again the comic in death tone is kept inappropriately. The foot scene was amusing and I was glad to see some the annoying being shot and demolished. The sex scene was amusing , the scene where Frances McDormand was interviewing the two didsy girls was quite funny, but overall the story wan't great. Like There's Something About Mary the story provided a few amusing moments, but that didn't make the film good-just OK. The film was never scary or suspenseful mainly because of the comedic ridiculousness of the situation and I was very glad about the stupid characters fates in this very overrated film.

We knew the truth. this was fiction, but we said nothing. I say this without fear of spoiling it for two reasons. Chances are you already knew it was fictional by now, a certain advantage of commenting on the film years later. Secondly, it really doesn't matter. The film is great, any way you look at it.

More of that can be found if you check the credits carefully, you'll see the symbol for the artist-formerly-known-as-Prince exists as a credit for the rather heavyset driver that is pursued by Peter Stromare. An unlikely match, but amusing considering Prince is from Minnesota, just like the Coen brothers are.What is so effective about \"Fargo\" is that despite it's fantastic content, it never loses the air of believability. I think most people forget about the little proclamation at the film's beginning by the time ten minutes have passed. My mother is not one of those people mind you. These brothers excel at story telling, and it's done so convincingly, you don't question it for a minute.Another interesting aspect of \"Fargo\" is its wide appeal. I never would've guessed that this would be the breakthrough film for the Coen Brothers. The Hudsucker Proxy was a sheer delight for me, and I consider it one of my favourite films, but it essentially flopped. It is fortunate that things finally turned around for the creative team of Joel and Ethan, with the unanimous success, praise and awards for \"Fargo\". They have a certain independent spirit that doesn't seem easy to crush. They do things just a little differently, and that's why they stand out as not only thoughtful filmmakers, but also somewhat masters of their own destiny. Marching to the beat of their own drum.

Fargo struck a cord with me (and I guess, those who nominated it for the Oscars) because it portrays reality in its true, stark, and unabridged form, which is often times as insensible as the killing of innocent passers-by, as confusing as the characterization of Stomare and Buscemi (they are both criminals but very different in their personalities), as as cold and barren as a North Dakota winter. There is no complicated plot, a lot of the events are purely circumstantial (e.g., McDormand's spotting of the Sierra prior to the final climax), and there are too many gory scenes (e.g., the woodchipper scene) and liberal use of that despised four-letter word, but ain't that how life is in reality, especially in the rural areas of the USA?I'm no critic to say whether Francis McDormand deserved an Oscar, but I can certainly say that the portrayal of her character, along with those of William Macy (think about your typical car salesman/conman), Buscemi, and Stomare were very realistic (maybe the reason for McDormand's Oscar) and reflects four different faces of human nature. Within the gripping real-life tale, there are small sprinkings of humor (e.g., when the police asked the whore at the Inn to describe what Stomare looked like, all she could say is that \"he is a funny looking guy, who wasn't circumsized\") - ain't that how shallow and stupid our behavior is, at times!I had two questions after seeing the movie. First, not having been to the Midwest myself, is that really the Midwestern accent (now I believe it is, after seeing some of the comments here). Second, why would McDormand's husband let her run after criminals on icy roads, knowing that she is pregnant. Maybe, there is a serious lack of good police officers in this country, which is why crime is so rampant!

Fine. But it's one thing to point out such a vision of reality in a film (successfully accomplished in, say, BADLANDS); it's another for a film to actually BE this vision of reality.

In short, it is not a film of substance and the point is that, truly in the sense which the Coen brothers mean it, only insubstantial, \"half-realized characters\" could be fans of it (naturally, to realize this point is to be \"realized\" and no longer be a fan).

I really wish Hayao Miyazaki's films were more readily avalible in the US, I've yet to see a less than amazing film by this master animator. I really hope the theatrical release of the masterpiece Princess Mononoke (which I've only been able to see on video) causes people to check out this and other Miyazaki films. The film contains some wonderful, hilarious moments like when the Totoro discovers how to use an umbrella, and the \"catbus\". The score by Joe Hisaishi is very good too, along with Ryuichi Sakamoto (The Last Emperor), Akira Ifukube (Godzilla), Masaru Sato (Yojimbo), and Toru Takemitsu (Ran), Hisaishi is my favorite Japanese film composer.I highly reccomend this film for both children and adults, if I had children, I would definitely show it to them. I would show them there's more to animation than cheesy 30 minute toy commercials. If we were living in a more perfect world, this is what would be showing instead of Pokemon: The First Movie. And adults, don't feel silly renting this for yourself. Even though i'm an adult, I never for a moment felt silly watching this film. The same goes for other very good animated films that are supposedly for kids, like Toy Story 2 and Nick Park's wonderful Wallace and Gromit shorts. The Fox/Streamline English-dubbed version is very good, way better than most English dubs of anime. This version is good to show to younger kids who may have trouble following subtitles.

One is the pacing. And one is the clouds.Let's talk about the clouds first. They're really amazing. Whenever I look outside and see those same big, puffy, sunny-day clouds, I always tell my kids, \"Those are Totorro Clouds.\" This is of course just one example of the amazing drawing and animation in this movie. Beautiful interior shots with amazing detail. Great drawings of people, although I'll never understand why anime always includes the huge round eyes and the cavernous mouths. There's the one scene where the tree grows all the way up to the sky. All hand drawn, it compares favorably to the best computer-assisted animation by Disney, Dreamworks, or the rest. It's just simply beautiful.Now on to pacing. The thing that really amazes me about this movie (and the thing that makes it superior to the other movies by this director) is that it is such a small, simple little story. Two young girls, ages about 4 and 7 I'm guessing, go out to the country with their father to be near their seriously ill, convalescing mother. Because of their stress, it seems, they meet some comforting mythological creatures who give them a ride around and then take them back home. That's about it.There are long, drawn-out scenes in the kitchen and in the family bath that you'd never catch in a Disney film. The most beautiful scene of all is that of the two girls waiting at the bus stop for their father to come home from work. They must wait on screen for at least a few minutes. It's astonishingly shocking and effective in its lack of activity. American filmmakers, who are always claiming that their animation is not just meant for children, still feel the need to pack every second of their movies with nonstop noise and action. Totorro, on the other hand, has the pacing you'd hope for if you moved out to the country. It's a simple, melancholy little film that just strikes me as so damn true to life.I've got plenty of younger friends who are totally into the more hardcore anime, like Akira and Ghost in the Shell.

As the family is very poor, Ali tries to keep it as a secret with his sister and doing this he would save his father from paying for new ones. In fact he was afraid of being beaten by his father too.\nDuring almost one hour they show the pranks of the child. This part is very funny. Some scenes show Zarah (the sister) looking at other girls' shoes and then being shamefaced because his brother's were very large in her feet. One that is very beauty is when they are cleaning the shoes and they start to play with the bubbles. Then Ali discover that there will be a challenge where the third prize would be shoes. So, he enter in the challenge to get the third position. As many other Iranian films it's a little bit slow and not audacious. But the best is that it show us Iran as it is and not as the USA want us to believe. Everybody know that they do a lot of things with the woman because of the religion but it's not so exaggerated as American films show. If you see 'Not without my daughter', an American film, you may think Iran is the poorest, ugliest and worst place to live in the world.

It's a credulous incredible storytelling of a young brother and sister in Tehran, and the adventurous saga around one very important pair of sneakers.The two young actors are amazing -- they play their guileless na\u00efve sensitivity with such earnestness! Central character, Ali, the 9 year old brother, is Mir Farrokh Hashemian, who really carried the film with his legwork, and the younger sister Zahra is Bahareh Seddiqui, who contributed her restrained share of screen presence. The pair is so natural: those furrowed faces, anxious knitted brows -- the range of sad faces the two came up with! The bond between the brother and sister is so warm and joyful - in spite of misfortunes.The storyline is seemingly simple. Such story-weaving knack writer-director Majid Majidi has -- he can make chasing along a streaming gutter into an intense dramatic episode! The story has the texture likened to a Thomas Hardy novel (poverty setting, episode after episode, turn of events), yet such a relishingly simple delivery. He doesn't have to tell it all on the screen -- little nuances and observations suffice.It's heartening to see young children who are polite and respectful to their elders, responsible and caring in dealing with their everyday problems, and not give up -- such quiet fortitude in spite of disappointments, such tolerance of their circumstance yet still able to find joy in little things. We catch a smile here and there, e.g., when they enjoy the impromptu soap bubbles, or when he encouraged his sister by giving her small tokens.This is an absolute gem of a family (value) film. Children's emotions untapped, yet adults are not left out -- touches of grown-up connections: the parents, the elderly couple next door, the shop-owners, all made this world very real.The camerawork, and the well-designed use of sound mixed with accompanying music (different tonal quality instruments were applied) complemented this cinematic experience. A poetic ending -- there's a serenity about it all.I hope \"Children of Heaven\" will win this year's 71st Academy Award Best Foreign Film Oscar -- it will receive its due exposure and more people will experience this gem.Along the lines of poverty and shoes, I thought of the Italian 1978's \"The Tree of the Wooden Clogs\" by writer-director Ermanno Olmi.

The Director's Cut transforms a good movie into a great one.\nWhat are the most popular Sci-fi movies these days, Blade or The Matrix? You notice the trench coats, the dark sets and the hunting for the bad guys plot lines? In many ways these movies are pale imitations of Blade Runner. Movie fans are all excited about virtual reality plots with super intelligent machines. It's all in Blade Runner but in a much more serious way.\nUnderneath a classic police manhunt/detective story lies visions of the future from author Phillip K. Dick. The super intelligent future machines will be our slaves not our masters. They will be genetically based, created and sold by huge powerful corporations. The wealthy will live in luxury while most people live in dirty, over populated cities in a polluted environment. These are the basic premises of Blade Runner and frankly I think most people have trouble dealing with it because it is likely to happen. Matrix fans talk about sinister forces being in control of the world. Blade Runner makes it clear who these controllers will be.And the film goes deeper. To create synthetic human beings the creators must be able to program the \"replicant's\" minds, that is control their reality. What is real or programming? The replicant does not know. It is virtual reality not in the arcade game world of The Matrix. Blade Runner predicts that science will be able to alter memories and thus reality. If a Corporation can alter a replicant's memories why not those of a naturally born human being? This issue is powerfully shown in Harrison Ford's scene at the piano which is covered in family photos, the symbol of memories.And the film goes deeper still. If \"machines\" are at least as smart as us, have feelings and are self aware, do they not deserve our respect and have rights? The tortured lives of two replicants illustrate this; Roy, the leader of the small slave revolt and Rachel, the pathetic female who does not know what she is and is later emotionally crushed by the truth.\nBlade Runner is more than a collection of ideas or a sharply accurate prediction of the future. It is a technical tour de force. These are the best sets (along with the many costumed extras) I have seen in a movie which truly create another world. The special effects, which are used to make this future more real, are very good. And the \"realism\" continues; How many typical Sci-fi heroes get hurt? In the typical Schwazenegger and now Matrix tradition the hero can get shot at by ten thousand bullets and not get a scratch. Blade Runner rightfully ignores this nonsense. Harrison Ford has to hunt down 3 very dangerous creatures and he gets hurt doing it! What a concept! It has been said that science fiction is mostly not about science but about fantasy. Blade Runner ignores this trend. It is very real and is masterfully crafted to create this reality and future. It is a grim prediction and is why this movie has never been a big hit, too much reality probably. I wouldn't have it any other way. Blade Runner is a brilliant film that has the depth to keep me coming back to it again and again."}, {"rank": 177, "name": "Blade Runner", "movie_year": "1982", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "I saw this movie when I was twelve and I didn't understand anything, but I was quite amazed of the darkness and the subsequent hell of the movie.

The first open sequence of the city is breathtaking, the flames, the buildings, specially Tyrell Corporation, all of this, brilliantly conducted by Vangelis soundtrack. To talk about this movie is to talk about the 3 essencial questions that the Human Being asks himself: \"Where do I come from? Where will I go? How long have I got left?\". This gives the movie it's philosofical perspective. The artifial world and the human specie are placed in this movie to show how dangerous it can get to \"play God\". The \"replicants\" are, supposedly, emocionally inexperient, flaw that is only possible to fix by memory implants. The end lines for Rutger Hauer brilliant performance prooves his humanity, perhaps this is the true theme of the movie: humanity, where does it starts, where does it ends, what boundries surround it and defines the human being? \"I've seen things you people wouldn't believe\", this is one of the most powerful moments of the entire film, the memories as builders of his emotions, his love for life...where is the boundry? The boundry that separates us from \"replicants\". Maybe life is just a constant quest for answers, those wich would reveal the meaning of life, death and our dawn. \"Blade Runner\" represents all of this brilliantly, and at the same time shows us a future, a dark and destructed future. Harrison Ford is excelent in the part of detective Deckard, a man in search of answers to his own questions, seeking those who threaten the human specie. During the movie he talks severall times about how \"blade runners\" musn't feel anything for the non-humans, but what better diplay of humanity than the one given by Rutger Hauer (Roy)?

Blade Runner, as one might expect, is no exception. The darkling monolithic near-future vision is comprehensively evoked and consistent.Performances from the strong cast are immersive and involving. It is the over-riding theme, though, which makes Blade Runner one of my favourite movies ever; that of mortality, lust for life, the transitory nature of one's being, the tragedy of self-awareness and love - it is all so fleeting.Though the movie tracks Deckard (Harrison Ford) pursuit and progressive execution of a group of rogue replicants (synthetic but fully feeling androids typically used as off-world slaves) that have escaped onto Earth, sympathy rests not with him but with the replicants themselves. Cursed with a three year lifespan and desperately trying to extend it by confronting their makers (the Tyrrell Corporation on Earth), their ebbing life (being hunted or simply expiring), the implicit vigour and understanding of the beauty of living is heart-wrenching. Note that the general release version is entirely different to the Director's Cut and grossly inferior. The Director's Cut does not have the misplaced bright Hollywood ending but rather an entirely different and more profound resolution. Watch it, be washed along with the gravity of the movie's theme and vista, and bear in mind: the life that burns twice as bright burns twice as fast, and Deckard dreams of unicorns."}, {"rank": 177, "name": "Blade Runner", "movie_year": "1982", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "For me to comment on how great this film is and why I love it so much would require two sets of hands and another lifetime, which ironically is one of the major themes of \"Blade Runner\".Let's start by saying it revolutionized sci-fi. What \"Star Wars\" did for the genre \"Blade Runner\" undid. It shows a dirty, ugly future much closer to the one we are approaching than any idealized version of the 21st century. Go to any major city street and it will look a lot more like \"Blade Runner\" Los Angeles than any other cityscape presented in sci-fi.Rutger Hauer gives the performance of a lifetime as Roy Batty. He is one of the greatest villains the movies have presented, right up there with Hopper in \"Blue Velvet\", Fonda in \"Once Upon a Time in The West\", or Darth Vader. The difference is Roy Batty is a sympathetic character who we as the audience come to realize is not really the bad guy. His intentions are completely understandable, even if the means to his end are not justifiable. His speech at the end of the film is the most memorable moment in the movie.Ridley Scott, the director, is a genius. That's all I'll say about that.Harrison Ford comes out of his superhero mode right after \"Raiders\" and \"Empire\" and plays a character he has rarely touched on before or since. Deckard is so unlike the usual Harrison Ford character, but he winds up being one of his best performances (though I'm partial to Indy in \"Raiders\", my other favorite movie). The important thing about Deckard is his sense of morality, or lack there of. You will see a metamorphosis unlike you may have thought Harrison Ford capable of.Warning: When the movie is over, remember to pick your jaw up off the floor, cause if you have any appreciation of movie genius, that's where your jaw will wind up. The film is breathtaking in it's visual beauty and mind boggling in it's commentary on humanity. I could explain it, but there is not enough time in the world.Please be sure to pick up the Director's Cut. It is literally a different movie than the one you may have seen prior to 1994. Not only different, but better by leaps and bounds.If I haven't said it already, I'll say it again: This is my favorite movie and one of the all time greatest!

Well, here we go anyway. Blade Runner is ultimate downer when it comes to visions of what the future. So many films have copied its style and imagery of a city drenched in a non-stop rain torrent illuminated by massive neon billboards its inhabitants most beyond redemption. (Terminator, Highlander, Robocop, The Fifth Element, and even Seven, the list is endless). It is ironic then that these films have enjoyed far more commercial success on first release than the film that inspired it. Ridley Scott can then smile that while most of these films, Highlander, Terminator and Robocop especially, have significantly dated, Blade Runner remains as fresh and original as it always was. The special effects, all done with models and matte work too, haven't changed. CGI is uncalled for; air brushing would nothing for a Monet. Ford is superb as Deckard, the embittered cop assigned without much choice to track down 4 rogue replicants. Ford hates the film, partly because he was almost killed in shooting and because he claims he played \"a detective who does no detecting and who just gives focus to Scott's sets\". This is untrue, the plot is compelling as Scott and the scriptwriters, David Peoples and Hampton Fancher transposed a Marlowe case in a dire future. However the plot takes second place to mood and atmosphere. Over the course of two hours we sniff great gulps of a hopeless future and mmmm! It tastes good! The film's countless sub-texts too are more prominent than the plot. The story is littered with clues as whether Deckard is a human or replicant and asks important questions such as who we are, what we're here for. Hauer, too is brilliant as Batty, the desperate replicant leader. It's a tragedy he never found a role that came anywhere close. Supporting players, Young, Sanderson and Hannah are superb to. But its Ridley Scott who takes all the glory. As well from having one of the coolest names in cinema, this is arguable his finest hour. His subtle direction HINTS at all the themes that he covers with no overt moralising and his awe inspiring visual genius and eye for detail was repeated in the brilliant, though criminally underrated 1492: Conquest of Paradise.

A dying city on a dying planet,teeming with a population of many different cultures it is an essential element of the movie,and any other interpretation would make this movie just another 21st century western.

In that series, Jack Webb, the actor who starred as the long-suffering hero \"Sergeant Joe Friday,\" also narrated the show's action. There was something very appealing and reassuring about his voice, and Ford, playing a rather different -- yet not so different -- policeman of the future in Blade Runner, brought back the memory of another good-guy cop from another time and place.Based (albeit somewhat loosely) on Philip Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?

Well, I was stupid and young. Now that it is out on DVD, I can enjoy it in all its film noir/sci-fi glory. By the way, this review is to the Director's Cut, which is the way it should be seen.It is 2019 and the technology of replicants has had some unexpected backfires. They look like humans; however, they are physically superior, if not mentally equal. A special police unit of Bladerunners has been created to combat this problem if they ever come to Earth. Deckard (Harrison Ford), is a retired Bladerunner who is brought back to track down and \"retire\" four replicants who sneaked into Earth. As he tracks the lead replicant (Rutger Hauer) and begins a love affair with a female experimental replicant, he begins to acquire clues that show him he may not be who he thinks he is..The acting in this movie is very good. Any movie with \"the man\" Harrison Ford seems to be good. Most of the emotional qualities of the characters seem flat, but that is what I would expect from the future that they live in. Harrison Ford is great as the Bladerunner Deckard, and Sean Young does well by playing his love interest Rachael. But Rutger Hauer does a really great job as a replicant who is desperate to survive.Let me just say that the special effects for this movie are really realistic, and they help get the feeling of an overblown gothic 50's city. The rest of the movie really does seem like it is during the post WWII years, but in a science fiction future. This movie is original and has the same qualities that make movies like The Matrix great. Any lover of science fiction should like this movie, but I know that it is not everyone's cup of tea. It is violent and it is slow moving, but it is beautifully shot, each scene done with care. I recommend it, and it is one of my favorite science fiction movies.

A science-fiction writer-critic once complained that Blade Runner is one of the most over-rated movies, arguing that it quite doesn\u00b4t live up to the book written by Philip K. Dick. Well, yes, it\u00b4s not as complex as the book itself, but I beg to differ. Blade Runner is one of the most UNDER-RATED movies ever. Only science-fiction fans talk about it, thus the movie is looked upon with arrogance by other genre\u00b4s fans and critics.Blade Runner tries, -and accomplishes it-, to be sober, realistic and ironic. Mixing action with calm, steady exposition, it brings the viewer the full view of a post-apocalyptic society, ranging from the high classes to the street level lives of some characters.You get slowly into the movie, experiencing a strange and cold environment, full of hightech gadgets (TV scanners, Videophones, hover-cars, androids, artificial animals, lie-emotion detectors, etc), and watch a detective-mistery-action-love story develop under a very firm and knowledgeable hand (Ridley Scott\u00b4s). The mistery and menace portraid by the androids (one of the focus of the film) remains throughout, gripping the viewer until the very end.The characters are well developed, the plot is complex and has interesting twists. Sometimes you want the detective to finish his job in a determined way, eliminating the cold threats he has in front; at other times, you can\u00b4t help but feel strangely sad as the detective becomes the predator against the threat (namely, against the first android woman, as she runs for her life).The action may be a little slow, but one knows that when something out of the ordinary flow of events happens, then the screen becomes the place for something thrilling. Whatever happens, Blade Runner never gets too violent; it portrays a possible reality. Having many layers of plot and great depth only emphasizes the greatness of this movie, rendering it realistic, dense and thought-provoking. Emphasis is given to the universal quest of finding out who we are, and when does reality, -life-, terminate.The acting is very good, from a \"I\u00b4m forced to do this\" attitude by Harrison Ford, to the ultra-sophistication of Sean Young. Rugter Hauer has one of his best performances ever, in this movie.The visual effects are good, even by today\u00b4s standards, making certain that the movie stays within \"realism\" boundaries.It\u00b4s an intriguing, hypnotic movie. It does not offend the book, albeit being different from it. It\u00b4s worth seeing again and again, and, if you think of all the sequels happening with some movies (not referring to Star Wars, of course), well worth some kind of continuation (meaning, of course, sequel...).

It was originally a novel called \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\" written by Phillp K. Dick in 1968. Blade Runner was released theatrically in 1982, it only made around $31 Million, and costed more then $39 to make. After all those years, Blade Runner the directors cut was released in 1992. Blade Runner eventually became a sci-fi classic after all that time, and is still not reconized by many people. Upon multiple viewings Blade Runner has proven to be the biggest sci-fi acheivement in Sci-Fi history of this century. Ridley Scott is was the genius behind this film, for once I actually liked a movie better then it's novel. The novel \"DaDoES\" was also great, but it was very different from the movie, it takes place in a different time, 2021 AD to be exact. Every moment in this film is just great, the speech was brilliant. The acting was superb, especailly Ruther Hauer, who did an outstanding job. Lots of other sci-fi films come close, such as 2001, Alien, Ghost In The Shell, Akira, Metropolis, Star Wars, The Matrix, but Blade Runner has proven to the best. Here's why I think Blade Runner is the best film ever made.First off, the set designs we're great! Syd Mead is genius to come up with such amazing ideas. Ridley Scott's world just looks brillant! I guess Ridley Scott wanted to show how the world will look in 2019. He made it look great, it looks great to us, but to the people there, it wouldn't be so great after all. The movie is generally dark and has a spooky atmosphere to it. The backgrounds we're very nicely done, not only the background, hell the people even looked great in the backgrounds! We get to see a few scenes where we can see very strange types of people walking around the rainy metropolis, a good example is the one where Deckard is chasing Zhora and jumpiong from building to building, car to car. This can't be seen in too many other movies, actually this was the first time it was ever shown. I was so amazed by the set designs and cinematography, I couldn't believe it was made in 1982. First time I saw this movie I was only 11 (im 15 at the moment), and I wasn't watching it carefully, I was more paying attention to the backgrounds. I was so amazed and dazzled at how great they looked, especially at scene in the Tyrell Building. The spinner scenes also looked amazing, the spinners looked *really* real, except you could tell that they we're computer generated at part where Gaff and Deckard are going to the Tyrell Corporation. Another great example was the scene when Leon and Batty are about the enter Chew's Eye Works, notice the background, and the how those oriental people come riding on there bikes, I found that pretty cool. The scene where Gaff and Deckard are going to the Police Headquarters was one of the best! The effects looked so real, and to top it off, it had great music. Animod Row looked great, lots of strange people in the backgrounds as well. The Tyrell Building was looked so cool, I could almost swear it was real. I've never seen such great Cinematography and Set Designs, and I don't suppose I ever will, until there is a Blade Runner 2.The music used in Blade Runner was easily the best I've heard in a movie. I don't know where to begin telling you how great it was. Every scene in Blade Runner just had amazing music, and it wasn't the same one used over and over (aka. Star Wars, Ghost In The Shell). The intro track is really good, it gives Los Angeles 2019 a great feel, it's also used in the scene where Deckard and Gaff are going to the Tyrell Corporation. Then the music in the scene where Deckard and Gaff fly to the Police Headquarters is amazing! It's less then two mins. but still it was *really* good. Another good track was Blade Runner Blues, which was used in the scene where Pris first comes in the movie, that's probably the best music though out the movie. Memories of Green was really really good!! It was used at the scene where Deckard picks up Rachael's picture that she throws on the floor after finding out that she is a replicant herself. I enjoyed the track Love Theme which was played in Deckard's apartment after Leon attacks Deckard in the ally. End Titles was just amazing, it was the track played at the end of the movie, during the credits. I also enjoyed On Trail of A Nexus 6, which plays in the background when Deckard is chasing Leon. A track that didn't make it to the cd, was the one which plays when Deckard is about to perform a Voight-Kampff test on Rachael, that's too bad since that music sounded great.The character in Blade Runner were really well put together, I don't care what anyone says. Harrison Ford played Rick Deckard, the main character of the movie. His character was great! His acting was superb, his face expressions we're really good. Deckard was shown to be a not-so-great man overall. His wife and child had even left him, but those we're just his memories if he was a replicant, which I believe he was. Ruther Hauer was easily the best actor of the film. Not did he only do a good job of acting, he looked pretty damned cool, especially at the scene at Chew's Eye Works. He played Roy Batty, one of the escaped Replicants lurking the streets of LA 2019. He did an academy winning performance, from the start of the movie, all the way to the end. His end line was just amazing, I don't know anyone else who could have played a better Roy Batty. Sean Young who played Rachael, did a damn good job. Her acting was great, and she always didn't seem human at times, I don't know how they did that. The rest of the cast did a great job, Edward James Olmos who played Gaff did an outstanding job, he didn't have much lines, but still he was just great in that role. Joe Turkel who played Eldon Tyrell did a real good job, who was shown like he was pratically playing god. Brion James who played Leon, didn't really have a big part of the film, but he did great. He did a good job at the start of the movie where Holden is questioning him, he acting like he was confused, and it was brillant. William Sanderson played J.F Sebastian, who did an alright job of acting though out the movie, could have been better, but some parts of his were great, especially the scene where he says that his glands grow old too fast. Robert Okazak who passed away a few years ago played the sushi master at the resturant at the start of the movie, for some reason I found him to be one of the greatest actors in the movie, espeically when he said that wonderful line \"He Say Your Brade Runna\", that was just amazing acting. The rest of the cast who had minor roles did a good/excellent job of acting, which isn't seen too often in Sci-Fi movies (aka. The 13th Floor, Total Recall, Star Wars).I found Blade Runner to be the most amazing movie ever made. Almost everything about it was perfect, except for the few flaws. Even today's effects can't match Blade Runner's, no not even Star Wars, sure they look more \"cool\", but do they look real? Hellno. Similar backgrounds from Blade Runner are used in many Sci-Fi movies and shows around these days (aka. Akira, Total Recall 2070), but they will never match Blade Runner. Ridley Scott and Syd Mead did something which no one else can ever replica. Blade Runner was nominated for best special effects, but didn't win, but it went on to win 3 UK Academy Awards. Blade Runner was also mentioned at the 1999 Academy's when they were showing the best films, it showed a spinner fly by LA 2019. I can't wait to see the sequel if there is one, which there should be around 2002, if they are making one. Blade Runner has the deepest impact ever, and it's easily the best motion picture ever made, an excellent work of art."}, {"rank": 177, "name": "Blade Runner", "movie_year": "1982", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Blade runner is a classic of sci-fi for sure.First of all, the story is damn cool.

Scott created a cool work who always seems dark and it's always raining... The music score by Vangelis is fantastic: it's hard to imagine any other music for this music.Another thing is that this movie doesn't gets old. What I mean is that there are not a lot of special effects like lasers. So this movie could actually have been made just a few years ago.

This one I thank him for. Ridley Scott might not have meant it but he has created a brilliant film about humanity, life, love and friendship. Because everyone had told me the replicants were the bad guys I kept a special eye on them and in the beginning you can see that while Pris and Batty's time was up the other two still had two years. They came out of friendship and the same with J F Sebastian. Like everyone else I have to say this is a great film and the acting is brilliant especially the Replicants, wether or not thins extends to Harrison Ford is something that has to be puzzled over.

It's a visual masterpiece, a film with a look all its own (most sci-fi fans prefer this to \"Dark City\"). It has a plentitude of theological and philosophical subtexts, so fans can wax literate about all the \"meaning\" that it has. It's \"2001\" for action fans.The plot (skip to the next paragraph if you don't want spoilers) goes like this: synthetic people called replicants, stationed on the \"off-world,\" are upset with their second-banana position in society and their limited life spans (apparently they were becoming too human), and rebel. They kill a bunch of their human supervisors -- by the way, all this happens before the story begins -- and head to L.A. to meet their maker (get it?), to ask him to extend their life spans past four years. Rick Deckard (sourpuss Harrison Ford), once a champion hunter of replicants, is called back from his retirement to go out and take them down. Along the way he falls in love with a replicant named Rachel (Sean Young -- one of the rebels? we're never really told), but still pursues his quarry. In the end he kills all but one replicant (Rutger Hauer, who's very good here). That replicant has killed the orignal replicant designer, but saves Deckard's life. After this, he (the replicant) expires and shuts down. Deckard returns to his apartment to see if Rachel is still alive. The ambiguous ending tells us that the couple may or may not be hunted by Gaff (Edward James Olmos, playing the Claude Rains role).For those who find the Greater Meanings to messy, inconsistent, disorganized and overcooked (like me) can still enjoy those primo visuals, and maybe even the Vangelis score, but they probably won't have much fun otherwise. There isn't much in the way of action sequences, though Ridley Scott does include plenty of shooting, bone breaking, skull crushing and eye gouging, and the story is pretty illogical (part of that can be blamed on the altering of some of Philip K. Dick's original ideas).

Borges, Dick and Lem come to the mind as examples... and now, Ridley Scott.Despite the outlandishness of the Blade Runner's world, there is one very strong link that connects it to our world, and it is its humanity.

It fulfills one of my requirements of great films in that I walked out of the theater a different person than when I entered. And it fulfilled another requirement in that it improved with repeated viewings.There is so much to take in visually, intellectually, and emotionally that my mind was overwhelmed at the first viewing trying to sort it all out. Unlike the so-called \"entertainment\" we get today at the movies, this film didn't spoonfeed its meaning to you. It left the ending ambiguous so your imagination has to supply it.The film demands discussion. There are so many topics to debate. Is Deckard a replicant? Do Deckard and Rachel live happily ever after? Why is there a unicorn in the director's cut? Is Deckard a hero? Or are the replicants really the good guys? Every time I watch it, my answers change.I may be one of the few that really likes the original. Probably because I've seen that version a couple dozen times since 1982 before the director's cut came out. This may contradict what I said earlier about being spoonfed, but I liked the narration because it explained what was going on in Deckard's mind. And I didn't mind the \"happy ending\" because it still implied that their troubles may not be over. \"I don't know how long we had together. Who does?\" But with that version memorized, I now appreciate the directors cut. It probably has the better ending. (At least I think so until I view it again!)It's also fun watching actors before they became more famous later like Sean Young, Daryl Hannah, M. Emmet Walsh, William Sanderson, and Edward James Olmos. I think they all did a great job. And Vangelis did a beautiful, moving score.After \"Blade Runner\", most of the big blockbuster science fiction movies boil down to good guys vs. bad guys with lots of loud explosions and in-your-face effects. Very simplistic messages, if any. That's why I still contend that an \"oldie\" like Blade Runner still outshines them all. It has incredible special effects, but never at the expense of the story. The cityscapes do more than dazzle you, they involve you.The more I think of it, the more I realize that \"Blade Runner\" is not only my favorite science fiction movie, but one of my favorite films in any genre.

Taking the example of the better sci-fi written material (personally I thought that \"Do androids dream...\" was OK but not special) the basic storyline is not science dependent; it could be the tale of (for example) someone hunting runaway slaves in colonial america.The film excels in three ways:Firstly, the Imagery is absolutely superb. The scene where Deckhard flies into the police headquarters has a sense of Odyssey, a feel of a visionary perspective into a possible future, that makes the film not just an audio-visual experience, but a true journey of discovery into a very different world.Secondly, the (Vangelis) soundtrack is incredible. Words fail to express the quality of the soundtrack, which beautifully adds to the \"immenseness\" of the visuals. When the film shows you a \"big\" scene, the music also touches you with a sense of the emotions underlying the scene; it doesn't let you avoid it.Finally, the acting is great.

Surprisingly, though human emotions are a main theme of this film, very precious few are revealed through the cold, stone faces the characters display throughout the movie, an expression that can be best explained as something between agony and boredom. Harrison Ford only goes as far as to put on the cocky grin that he is famous for, and the occasional voice-overs that drop in every now and then are both unnecessary and uninspiring (director Ridley Scott was wise enough to cut the voice-overs from the recent Director's Cut version).Poor acting aside, the film drives itself along solely on its basic premise: that being the questioning of reality. The story, adapted from classic sci-fi writer Phillip K. Dick, pulls the viewer in through excellent scenes such as where Deckart goes over some fragments of Rachel's memories, thereby revealing to her that she is an android, and the soliloquy delivered beautifully by Roy Batty as he takes his last breath. One can't help but be moved by the chilling revelation of discovering that a whole lifetime of memories has been a lie, to be aware of your existence as only a machine.Whereas other science-fiction movies are mostly a combination of action and special effects, BladeRunner goes the extra step to provide the emotional effect which the movie viewer carries with him after the film is over.I gave it an 8."}, {"rank": 177, "name": "Blade Runner", "movie_year": "1982", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "This film is a part of my life, for the better and for the worst.

I have to admit, the only reason I became interested in this movie was because I knew it had something to do with Harrison Ford, but I ended up liking everything about this movie and going out and buying the book by Philip Dick.

The plot needs to be taken on its own terms - if you can accept the basic premises of Deckard's job, then you can be drawn into the unfolding story. Sure it can be slow, because all good Sci-Fi is.

Time to die!\"), and Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer)'s death speech. Hauer literally stole the scene (the words \"like tears in rain\" were ad-libbed!), and the sylloquy literally moved me to tears. After all these years, and all the times I've seen this film, it still does! All Roy wanted was to be human, and he could only find his humanity in death.To hell with what Leonard Maltin thinks of this film! For me, it ranks with \"2001: A Space Odyssey\" as one of the most ambitious views of the future without any hype and schlock normally associated with science fiction. Everything has a worn, grimy feel to it, unlike the bright, shiny props in so many films. The colors are unusual. Most of the interior scenes have sepia or tan backgrounds. The camera angles and lighting are incredible, and Harrison Ford's acting is totally believable.The film isn't perfection, but dammit, it reaches out and touches it!(Take note as to how many of the gadgets and themes are now commonplace. Retrofitted buildings, laptop computers, digital video, on-board computers in cars, the heavy influence of Asian pop culture and cuisine in the USA, all in a film made in 1982!)"}, {"rank": 177, "name": "Blade Runner", "movie_year": "1982", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "An almost completely rewritten script, a perfectionist director, a lead that had rotten relations with cast and crew, producers baying at the door and the author of the original short story didn't like what was being done at all. Isn't it strange that a lot of masterpieces are made in times of such strife (see Apocalypse Now, Easy Rider, The Shining and The Exorcist.)Yes, I said masterpiece. At first I didn't think it was either. A good film, maybe even a great one, but a masterpiece? Never. The Directors Cut did nothing to change my opinion when it was first released. Now it's easily my favourite science fiction film and quite possibly the finest film that deals with the meaning of identity ever made. Especially the D.C.The script may have been written and rewritten but lets face it, it was worth the wait. There are so many marvelous lines and wonderful scenes it boggles the mind. Hampton Fanchers original draft was okay but it was never as good as David Peoples re-write. The script also hints at deeper meanings behind the obvious. When Batty says \"Show me what you're made of\" what exactly does he mean? Is it a straight challenge or a reference to Deckards origins?That's a matter I could never resolve. Is Deckard a replicant? When I watched it the first time there was never a moment I doubted his humanity but after reading other peoples views I find it harder to stick to that. Maybe I'll never know. Maybe Ridley Scott didn't want us to. Scott's touch is undoubtedly the guiding light behind the film. The themes and techniques he used in Alien are exploited here to the full. Syd Mead may have designed that horrible city of the future but Scotts lens never quite manages to damn it. He gives the cold streets a dangerous, foreboding look but finds time for great warmth as well in Deckards apartment. He's helped by Vangelis' marvelous score which fills every scene with such emotion and power it's impossible not to be moved.Harrison Ford may hate the film, Sean Young may have hated working on it but there's no doubt that they and Rutger Hauer give career best performances. It's such a shame that Young and Hauer went into a career nosedive after this that neither have recovered from. The rest of the cast do their jobs admirably as well but Ford comes up trumps. Forget Witness, the Star Wars' or anything else he's done. This is as good as he's been.Perhaps the best way to judge a films affect on the industry is to see how many times it's been imitated. How many times has BladeRunners view of the future been ripped off? Too many. How many have looked as good? With the exception of The Matrix (maybe), none of them. BladeRunners most famous aspect is it's cynical view of what the metropolis will look like once we're finished wih it. But it's not its best. It's the way it constantly questions what being human is and what humans are meant to be and humans are meant to do that I love so much. In this film man plays God by creating a being in its own image. Man wants to control the being. The being does not want to be controlled. It retaliates. Is this a moral or a warning? Like the rest of the film Scott doesn't answer, just lets us draw our own conclusions.Enough. I've gone on far too long. But I could go on forever. Maybe one day I'll right an essay on the film. Or maybe I'll just watch it instead. Yeah, I'll probably just watch it. After all, it is a masterpiece.

Anyone who doesn't agree with this statement should watch Metropolis, 1984 and Judge Dredd, so you get into the mood, and then watch Blade Runner. Then perhaps you will enjoy.This film is relaxed in it's approach: summing up the mood of Harrison Ford's character, Deckard, who wants to retire and move at his own pace. It is also dark and mean in some respects giving a bleak vision of a dark future: a future where man's idea of playing God has no certainty and comes back to haunt him.Blade Runner is perhaps portrayed from Deckards point of view that life in the dark and nasty bleak rat race is a pointless exercise and existence and that new pastures must be found.Some parts of the film are outstanding in every sense: the chase around the apartments between Deckard and Rutgar Hauers character, the replicant Roy Batty, the scene where Deckard is saved from a long fall by the man he is assigned to terminate (i.e. Roy Batty), the images of the flying police vehicle, shots of the immense and gigantic Tyrrell Corp. Building, the dark and creepy images of the toys and little people in JD's apartment where the silence and eerie atmosphere combine and the final scenes where Deckard goes out to the countryside ((played by a fresh faced Sean Young) a one-off replicant who has no time limit to her life span).

The story, which deals with Deckard (Harrison Ford), the special futuristic bounty hunter hired to track down a group of escaped androids is the perfect example of a look at humanity. The androids are made out to be evil, but in reality it's their creator Tyrell who truly is the wicked one.This story is excellent, the androids are all sympathetic (remember, the crime they commit is wanting to be more human), and you will feel heartbroken at the end of the movie when you hear Deckard's mental soliloquy concerning the fate of Batty, the lead android. Ridley Scott really outdid himself with this picture, which is one of my favorite sci-fi flicks along with They Live.It is a shame that in today's society trashy animated films which rely totally on gore and sex to entertain rather then actual human development are so popular, while films such as this are left to neglect simply because people view it as something Harrison Ford did to kill time between \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" and \"Return of the Jedi\".If you have not seen it, then watch this movie at once.

Of course I have subjected myself to both versions, and of course the Director's Cut is better, but still this is beside the point. For a film made seventeen years ago and culminating with the kind of visceral fascination and kinetic cinemania that this one inspires is almost unheard of. We could get into arguments about the relative outdatedness of even the most classic of films (even those nifty hippie-inspired stewardess wardrobes in Kubrick's \"2001\" look hopelessly tacky today); \"Blade Runner\" however, still holds its own. A beautiful piece of cinema, everything in this film comes together like clockwork. Jordan Croenworth's cinematography, Douglas Trumbull's special effects, the performances of Harrison Ford (who showed his relative worth as an actor first in this film, not Peter Weir's \"Witness\"), Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah and Sean Young at her most soulful, and most notably, Ridley Scott's meticulous direction make this one of the great films. How could I forget Vangelis's score? Who could dispute the evocative dreaminess of the scene where Young lets her hair down at the piano as Vangelis's electronic palette of eerily beautiful melancholia reaches its crescendo? Or the bluesy overtones of the scene where Ford analyzes a photograph and cries of childhood are subliminally heard in the background? Or in one of the most poignant sequences in cinematic history, at the end on the rooftop, the perfect combination of music, imagery and dialogue. Don't get me wrong, I believe \"2001\" to be a film of enormous versimilitude; it is quite possibly the greatest sci-fi of all time (it is certainly the most ambitious); \"Blade Runner\" though creating a world with as much ingenuity and pizazz as ever before seen in cinema, is a much more subtle work and offers an opposing side as to the haunting effect of cinema; Scott's direction at least deserved an Oscar nomination, as did the film itself, the cinematography, the music, the film editing and the sound (they all failed to resound a single nod in all of the aforementioned categories). The only other sci-fi film I would compare this to as to having the same subtle reach and beautiful realization of cinematic artistry would be Peter Weir's \"The Truman Show\", a film which is, like \"Blade Runner\", less science fiction and more of a foretelling of things to come. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences must not like being reminded of the gloom and doom that the world is apparently headed toward: I don't blame them, for it's nice to think of a world with no conceivable problems. But their relative lack of any type of cinematic appreciation is unforgivable especially in the past few years: the comforting strains of \"Gandhi\" and \"E.T.\" over \"Blade Runner\"?

Based on the novel \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep\" the movie adaptation loses a lot of the deeper subtext but still manages to convey the problem with creating artificial humans, if they grow emotionally doesn't that make them human too? One thing I missed that was in the novel was the \"mood organ\" which allowed humans to control their moods artificially, insuring they were happy with their jobs and their lives.

It was the first big sci-fi film since \"Star Wars\" and its sequels and was unjustly compared to these very different kinds of sci-fi movies. It is only recently that it has been recognised as a great film. Its original soundtrack was unavailable until recently as well.I remember watching the Academy Awards and being disappointed by the nominations and the results. Didn't Vangelis' (\"Chariots of Fire\", \"Missing\") deserve a nod for best film score? \"Blade Runner\" was nominated for best visual effects and, as usual, the Academy went for the SENTIMENTAL favourite, much less deserving of an Oscar. \"Blade Runner\" had virtually a whole city created by a computer (computer graphics weren't as easy to generate back in 1982!) while, the winner of the Oscar, \"E.T.\", simply had some kids ride bicycles in the air.\"Blade Runner\" was not a film with a complicated and original plot with surprises and twists randomising the heart-rate of the viewer sitting propped up on the edge of his seat. Nor did the film have intensive dialogue and interesting characters. Its plot was simple. Its script was concise (although there are some memorable lines). Its characters were somewhat plain (except, perhaps, for J.F. Sebastian). But all these were meant to be, for Blade Runner was not intended to be a high-powered drama; it was meant to be an artistic masterpiece, a film about ambience and atmosphere, a film directed at creating particular moods in the viewer, a film intended to dazzle the eye and exhilarate the ear. And it succeeded at these aims marvellously. It is art and film noir at its best.A gloomy, dark, rainy, depressing Los Angeles, in the future, is the scene of a \"blade runner\" assigned to bump off rebellious \"replicants\" - artificial life forms created for slave labour in space. The film opens with columns of fire spouting into the air next to flying automobiles and chillingly smooth melodic synthesisers from the composer Vangelis. It is crowded, smoky, and various ethnic languages have melded together in the local Creole dialect. I liked the idea, also, of the umbrella stems being fluorescent lights.\"Blade Runner\" seemed to be a blessing on the actors that played in it; for, many unknowns became famous after the film and had the good fortune of winning roles in blockbusters. Rutger Hauer who plays the leader of the replicants became well known and starred in \"The Hitcher\". Sean Young, until this film, unknown, appeared in such films as \"Dune\", \"Wall Street\", and \"No Way Out\" with Kevin Costner. Darryl Hannah, another unknown, made it big in \"Splash\", \"Roxanne\", and teamed up with Sean Young again in \"Wall Street\". Edward James Olmos emerged from obscurity and acquired the role of the police chief in TV's Miami Vice series. He won a number of Emmy Awards. William Sanderson became \"Larry\" of \"Larry, Darrel and my other brother Darrel\" in the TV series Newhart.I was sorely disappointed with the Director's cut of the film. One would expect a D-Cut to ADD footage, but footage was only removed - Rick Deckard's voiced over dubbing, the ending, and so on. All that was added was some silly dream of a unicorn. LEAVE THE ORIGINAL CUT ALONE!!! The D-Cut took away from the film's charm. Again: Leave the original cut alone! Why mess with it? DON'T!I wish that more films were made in a similar spirit to \"Blade Runner\". Recently, \"Dark City\" re-captured some of its charm of it but lacked much of the old \"Blade Runner magic\", a great score to name but one lacking element.

I have seen every important sci-fi movie, and personally, Blade Runner reveals itself to be a superior film.\nSpace Odyssey and Alien come close, but they do not hold up as well as Blade Runner upon multiple viewings. Space Odyssey tends to lull in its more psychedelic moments, leaving one with a feeling of confused longing. No matter how many theories are expounded based on the content of the film, its ultimate meaning will remain ever-ambiguous, as Kubrick intended it to be. Alien is weakened by its inability to reach the viewer on a higher philosophical plane. The suspense in the film is nearly unparalleled, and Sigourney Weaver is fantastic, but it falls short of the excellence displayed in Blade Runner.\nLet me explain why Blade Runner is my favorite:\nThe most striking aspect of the film is its cinematography. There is nothing but genius in the shooting of every scene. The use of shadows and low camera angles bears an uncanny resemblance to the cinematography of Citizen Kane. My favorite shot is when we get our first glimpse into Tyrell's office. The lighting effects in all of that set's scenes are fantastic.(especially when the windows become tinted). Please note that the lame-brains at the academy did not nominate Blade Runner for Best Cinematography. How stupid can you get?\nBehind every film is the Director's vision, and in this film, Ridley Scott displays incredible vision. His conception of a futuristic LA, as characterized by the inevitable demographics of the future, is what allows the film to transcend its era and remain appreciated in the future. Many of the themes in the movie originate from the sci-fi novel (which carries an absurd title that does not obey the rules of logic:one does not dream of sheep; one thinks of sheep in an attempt to achieve a state of dream), yet the manner in which those themes are presented brings about the full genius of Ridley Scott. (How many Hardcore rock fans know where the phrase \"more human than human\" comes from?) Through the example of the replicants, Scott exposes the human sin of taking life for granted. Furthermore, he asks: what does it mean to be human? Do we have a false vision of our own morality as a race? Do we ignore our own evils? Can we play God as Tyrell attempts to do? The complexity of all these questions allows for many viewings of the film.And then, of course, there are the actors. None of them stand out in their roles, and yet the acting is perfect. Harrison Ford plays Deckard, the misanthropic ex-cop, who comes off as a veritable anti-hero. Sean Young plays Rachel, the incredibly human replicant that steals his heart. Rutger Hauer plays Roy, the umistakably Aryan leader of the replicants. All three of them deserved Oscar nominations. The other minor roles are superb as well.Finally, Blade Runner would not be itself without the Vangelis soundtrack. It has a wonderful mood-controlling effect throughout the film. I especially like the Blade Runner Blues, and Rachel's song.\nI think that anybody who's read through my entire comment gets the point: I love this movie and I find it to be the best. If you haven't seen it, get over to the video store NOW!!! For first time viewers be sure to get the original version. When you have become familiar enough with the plot, go see it as it was meant to be, (without the voice-over), and rent the director's cut.

These two philosophical inquiries are explored at great length in Ridley Scott's \"Blade Runner\" The film is based on Philip K. Dick's great novel \"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" The inquiries that I have just mentioned were originally present in the novel, and despite much academic criticism, they are also present in \"Blade Runner\"In a sense, it is difficult to discuss the film without discussing in terms of the novel, so I will make constant comparisons in this review. Many critics have argued that the awesome visual effects and stylish cinematography overwhelm the content of the story and themes. This response is not entirely uncommon, despite the huge cult following the \"Blade Runner\" has accumulated. The film does not deserve such criticism. On a second viewing of the film, the spectacular effects do not overwhelm the story. We can understand that the visuals depicting Los Angeles in the year 2019 help to advance the themes. Many critics miss the human side of the story, or lack there of, and may object to the powerful visuals for this reason. It can be argued that the visuals serve to portray a dehumanized world where only subtle signs of humanity's existence are dispersed throughout, where existentialist notions such as what being human is and what being human means are not easily answered. In a way, each medium reinforces the other. There are many obvious differences between the novel and the film, but they essentially complement one another in result.\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\" has two primary themes, which are also present in \"Blade Runner\". The first is what constitutes the essential human being and how we distinguish the essential human being from that which only masquerade as human. And the second theme is that if you fight evil, you will wind up becoming evil. In the film, we have the character of Deckard who is becoming more and more dehumanized throughout the story, and the replicants are becoming more and more human.

I've got both the Director's Cut and the original version on laser disc and as another person commented, I also prefer the original version. The narration that's missing from the Director's Cut is not necessarily crucial to the story line, but it does help out a first time viewer of the film. Sean Young also caught my attention as she, in my opinion, is positively gorgeous in most every scene. I melt when she first comes on to the screen in her first scene as she is walking across the floor at the Tyrell Corp. and asks Decker, \"Do you like our owl?\" Lastly, my favorite scene is when Rachel let's her hair down, starts to play the piano and when Decker sits next to her and tells her that she plays beautifully, she gets up and starts to leave his apartment (for the 2nd time).

Just prior to release, after screening by focus groups (it's always an excellent idea to let the general public alter a film director's artistic vision), the final studio version had narration overlaid and the ending changed in order to appease the mass public.

It has underlying meanings in it even if Ridley Scott did not put them there intentionally they are there. It brings moral questions of can life be ended even if it was man made? These are questions that are irrelevant to us now concerning synthetic humans but BladeRunner gives us insight to what may come of our world, it shows a bleak and dark world covered in mist, all created by visualist Miede, combined with incredible music by Vangelis, together they combine to show us a world that does not seem too flavorful. The people that are left on the BladeRunners world are the outcasts, people who are forbidden or cannot afford to go \"Off World\". In the novel by the great Philip K Dick these people are called Chickenheads. People aimlesly walking around with no real purpose anymore.The performances in BladeRunner are excellent, even though there was little friendship between some of the actors and to the director none of it shows on the screen. For example, Harrison Ford and Sean Young detest each other in life but on screen they have a great chemistry as star crossed lovers. Ford didn`t completely get along with Scott Either. And still to this day Ford says that this was never his best work but enjoyed it none the less. Possibly this is Rutget Hauers best performance as to date, it took him less than 1 minute to be directly cast as Roy Batty as he walked into interview room clad in a leather coat and ready bleached blond hair.If you have never seen this movie before you must, but maybe for the less enthusiatic Sci-Fi watcher the general release version would be better with the voice over helping to explain the plot, but for the experienced and open minded watcher should watch the directors cut, the letterbox edition is beautiful and shows exactly how Scott wanted you to see it.

Almost subconsciously the film makes the audience deal with the question of slavery, and really makes one realise how precious the time we have to spend with our loved ones is.Harrison Ford superbly plays his usual \"ordinary Joe trying to do right\", but it is Rutger Hauer who shines the most. As Roy Batty, leader of the Replicants, he achieves just the right mix of ruthless but vulnerable.

If you love the movie, I'm with you, but the damn thing ALWAYS makes me cry; so after about the tenth time I watched it over a 10 year period (I drink when I watch it) I finally realised that besides the very incredible cast, and the interesting story, there was something else swilling around at the bottom of the movie that inevitably made me blub at the end. Sean Young is gorgeous of course, but so? The real message of the movie is this: that Deckard [the protaganist], could fall in love with an android - something pretty much against ALL his training. By the end of the movie we see that people [you, me, the protagonist] can fall in love with anything, just so long as it is able to capture your heart. It is THE movie that is totally anti-bigot, that strips taboo down to raw emotion and declares \"if your heart WANTS this, you won't be able to stop it\". It is a movie about forbidden love, taboo, intrigue, death and life: pretty juicy stuff. And the unspoken message is simply 'people will give their hearts away to whoever will pay their price, and furthermore, they won't be able to help themselves'. Because, if you remember, ol' Sean is just a machine - an appliance really, a big, complicated vaccuum cleaner with an incredibly great face, but still a machine; just a machine. And to prove the point, there he is, the android Roy Batty who in the end loved life so much that he would not even take the life of his would-be killer. It's THAT message about the individual: that the Nazi can fall in love with the beautiful Jewish chick; that the militant black guy can be transfixed by the innocent white girl; that the boundaries of race or creed or color, or even of flesh and blood, are actually no boundaries at all... that if Deckard can cross them, anybody can. He falls in love with an android, and shows us that no matter how you were trained or raised or brought up, there is the possibility of love... that somewhere in time, even if we are \"sushi\" - even if we are cold fish - we can love anything, or anyone."}, {"rank": 177, "name": "Blade Runner", "movie_year": "1982", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "The Director's Cut of this classic 1982 film is simply masterful.

Dick, BLADE RUNNER must be ranked as one of, if not the, greatest visual achievements in the history of cinema. Directed by Ridley Scott (Alien), the story focuses on Los Angeles, 2019. A film-noir technopunk verisimilitude dominates in this time, as large blimps extoll the virtues of going \"off-world,\" while the majority of people live in pollution and towering pyramid buildings, where strobe lights of various hovercrafts wind across gothic stone gargoyles, where the sun never seems to rise and the torrents of rain never stop. The culture of Los Angeles seems to naturally grow from our present time; there is a large Asian and Hispanic community and culture. Deckard (played with a splendidly Marlowean low-key by Harrison Ford) is a \"Blade Runner\"- cops specially trained to eliminate illegal off-world worker androids who run amok on earth. The leader of the \"replicants,\" Roy (Rutger Hauer), seek only a chance to live beyond their pre-determined deaths. As Deckard descends further and further into the hunt through the seedy streets, he also discovers a most unusual love interest-- a legal android (Sean Young) who refuses to believe her memories are fake. As mentioned before, BLADE RUNNER has a wonderfully unique vision of the future, created by visualist Syd Meier, that every science fiction film from RUNAWAY to THE FIFTH ELEMENT has \"borrowed,\" to put it nicely. However, what truly makes the story compelling is the quest for humanity, and what truly makes us human. If at all possible, view the Director's Cut: the ending is completely different, more realistic, and ultimately more powerful.

Set completely in the streets of Vienna, it's the improbable story of an American College student (Ethan Hawke) looking for his answers to a crushed love life during an extended vacation through Europe on an Eurail pass. On his way to Vienna he meets a French student (Julie Delpy) on her way back to Paris after a vacation with her grandmother, and asks her to spend his last day in Europe with him before he has to catch his plane back to the States.Richard Linklater, having made such movies as \"Slackers\" and \"Dazed and Confused\", had people pretty set in their beliefs of what to expect: Another flick based on the aggravations and twists of the usual All-American-Teen's life. To everyone's great astonishment though, he gave them a whole lot more than what they had bargained for, as well as giving critics a definite run for their money when they saw that Linklater was capable of a lot more than just your roll-of-the-mill teen movie. I've had a quite a bit of difficulty pondering over the dilemma as to whether the movie is either American, or \"European\" . Some aspects of the movie force you to immediately decide on either one or the other, but, once you look over the other facets, you soon see that there's a lot more too it than a simple decision of one or the other. This movie is far from being a \"Black or White\" standard, but more of a plethora of shades of gray that have to be sorted through one by one. So taking each and every point on which the movie could either be classified as being one or the other, and coming up with the most with a valid reasoning as to whether it is either an American or \"European\" movie seems to be the most plausible solution. First of all, the filming could be much more readily compared to that of a \"European\" movie than an American movie's. For example, there are quite a few scenes where nothing is said, and the characters either look out at the scenery or onto some event (the belly dancer, or looking out the window on the train), at each other (the caf\u00e9 scene), or are plainly seen strolling down some lost Viennese back street in deep thought (pick your choose). Even when they are talking, there are usually several shots of both characters which, unlike the more common close up shots of the speaker in American movies, are a lot more decentralized, and obscure. These can differ from a distant shot over the shoulder of one of the two characters, a shot from the end of the street or square where they are talking, or a ground shot of both characters at once. Whereas in an American movie there is a definite transition between different places, with a quick explanation of the change of scenery, there are no definite transitions of movement in \"Before Sunrise\". The characters will sometimes suddenly turn up in another location with no explanation as to how they got their, talking on a completely different subject than two seconds ago in the previous location. Of course due to the set time of the movie, and the necessity of capturing it all in a standard film length, this is an obvious necessity, if not a little unnerving at the beginning if we haven't caught on to what's going on. Unfortunately though, for someone who knows Vienna the transitions may seem a little confusing, as they often switch from one locale to another on the complete other side of the city, and then suddenly appear two minutes walk from their first position. The movie is completely devoid of any action, and sports little music whatsoever other than what the two characters hear as they stroll though the city, which is quite a change from the continuous barrage of sound and movement we've come to expect from even the most docile of American movies. Even though it may feel unerringly quiet, and obscure at the beginning with everything so lighthearted, and calm, you learn to sink into the atmosphere, and start to truly believe the movie as being a plausible if not true story. This makes for a pleasing relief from most movies out today, which have a constant watermark of \"Fiction\" just visible throughout the movie, and where each of the main characters has his own theme song. As for the story, I feel that it greatly differs from both American, and \"European\" movies altogether. No one is out to kill anyone, no one has a deep dark family secret, neither of the two is in the middle of a psychological crisis bordering on suicidal, nor does the world get shattered by some freak natural disaster in which both characters become the unlikely heroes. Instead it's simply about the two college students, and their mutual stay in Vienna. The whole story revolves around their lives, their desires, their personal philosophies, and basically any crazy thoughts that may pop into their minds. That's it. No thrilling underlying plot, just bursting at the seams to get out and surprise us, no irrelevant twist in character or story to confuse or defy us to believe the impossible. Just the simple, but short relation between two people and their conversations among themselves and those they meet during their stay. Neither of the two turn into an alien a la George Arrakis, nor are they in search the long awaited \"first time\" as in \"American Pie\" (well, at least not to that extent). But regardless the lack of an incredibly complex plot, the movie ends up to be more than satisfying if you ever found yourself in a similar conversation, ever lived through any of their many points of conversation, or even wished you were in the shoes of either of the two to enjoy such a simple yet gratifying moment.The actors are even harder to classify than the story due to their insistence on avoiding the regular stereotypes of being either plain American or French. Even if the movie were seen purely from the point of view from one of the two characters, the two would still resist classification due to the free manner in which they act, and the simplicity with which they blend into each other. Hawke may start off as the suave college guy that thinks he's going to get himself the girl, but he soon turns out to be a thoughtful romantic who doesn't seem to be completely at ease with women for the simple reason that he doesn't understand them; especially those that can put up with his ways, and effortlessly return his remarks bite for bite. Delpy on the other hand emanates a strong air of cool intellectual sophistication seeming to have everything clear in her head, but quickly proves herself to be a lot more free-speaking, and confused than Hawke, who was meant to be the one with the irresolvable problems. They definitely manage to pull their roles off very well on both sides (if not a little less at the end when they both turn into bumbling adolescents), keeping to their characters in both words and actions. Even when they stray off from their usual selves (For example, Hawke's romanticism in the Ferris wheel compared to his comments on the fortune teller), there always seems to be a probable explanation later on in the movie for their apparent deviation, and even then they never wander very far from what one would expect of someone in a similar situation. Their conversation, like their acting is very hard to lock down as being either of one or the other genre, as both American and \"European\" filmmakers have hardly ever touched onto movies that are based purely on conversation and so little action. To make life simple, you could just tag it as being \"European\" for the simple reason that there is nothing but conversation in the movie, which would be more probable in a \"European\" movie than in an American movie, but that would be taking a very simplistic path out of a much more complicated question. The question isn't really whether the conversation is more American or European, as it touches equally on both styles, but in different degrees, as well as in different circumstances. The question thus becomes, are both characters truly one or the other type (notwithstanding the fact that they both act very much out of their stereotypes), or are they simply a smorgasbord of both American and European views, giving the scriptwriter a way of creating the situations at his own guise? One could break down their conversation into several different categories: memories, thoughts and philosophies, explanations, and simple \"down-time\" conversation. At the beginning of the movie, Delpy has little trouble discussing memories, and past events, while Hawke has a lot of trouble telling Delpy any of his due to their social background. He hasn't gotten used to the fact that he'll be spending the next fourteen hours with her, and still hasn't gotten a feel for her what she's actually like, so he's reticent of letting too many personal thoughts out. Delpy on the other hand finds it a way to get the conversation going, jumping onto new conversations as a way of getting to know Hawke, expecting him to respond with similar memories or events. Delpy doesn't wait to point out that it was Hawke that had started the game of asking each other a question, but this only makes Hawke all the more uncomfortable with the situation. When they start discussing their points of view on different subjects, such as feminism, and views on life, they both seem to hold to their respective nationality's theories, but often explain themselves in ways that would be more probably for the other person's upbringing. Hawke for instance is often quoting lines from authors and poets that he heard or read, while Delpy bases most of her points on personal experience. She also seems a lot more inflexible in her views while Hawke easily ends up swaying to her objections, accepting her comments with very little retort. While we could expect this to be the other way around due to their national educational backgrounds, this could of course be entirely owing to the personality of the two characters instead of being seen as a stereotype, but it would seem to be a very sudden change from the \"opposing nations\" pattern readily visible throughout the rest of the movie. As for their explanations for their situations in life and love, they seem to correspond to their respective stereotypes more than in any other aspect of the movie. For example, Delpy takes a lot longer to describe her relationship with her ex-boyfriend than Hawke does, but for a completely different reason than he expects. Hawke is simply on a guilt-trip over the fact that he's with his newfound companion so soon after having broken up with his girlfriend only several days prior. Delpy, on the other hand sees her relational break-up with her ex-boyfriend as more of a moral experience that has formed her life into something new and utterly confusing, which must have some higher meaning that she hasn't been able to grasp yet. When they finally explain their situations to one another, Hawke quickly finds himself at a loss for words in Delpy's explanations on how she imagines herself getting over her metaphysical dilemma while banging her frustration away on a pinball machine. For Hawke, the question was simply whether it was right to be in the arms of another woman so soon after breaking off his last relationship, but this doesn't comply with her complex dissection of a similar event, but taken in a completely different fashion. Their opposing views could be put aside as being a man's views on a relationship clashing with those of a woman, but they fall into similar situations several times in the movie on completely different subjects, with Delpy in full sway on a certain point, and Hawke completely lost, only just able to keep up his end of the dialogue. At certain moments of the movie, usually after a long debate on one of their philosophies of life or a session of frank justifications, the two end up talking about nothing. By nothing, I mean the type of conversation one has when there isn't much to talk about, or simply babbling while waiting for a new topic of interest to liven up the dialogue (such as the scene under the statue in front of the Natural History Museum, or at the caf\u00e9 before the fortune-teller comes by). During these times both Hawke and Delpy seem to find an equal ground where they both just let out what's on their minds, and more often than not find that they both hold similar views on a lot of things. While all their heated discussions that dominate prove that they both have their own opinions on different facts of life, these moments allow them to see that they're closer than they had imagined, despite differing opinions. I don't believe this belongs to either one of the two stereotypes, but becomes more of a conciliation between the two of them. If they had spent the whole movie bickering and biting at each other without ever finding a subject on which they held a common viewpoint, the ending would have been quite different indeed, and the movie would quite tiresome. But with those moments when they find themselves coming closer to one another and understanding the other's views is proof that everything could still work out.After having gone over the myriad of possibilities that could categorize this movie as being either American or \"European\" I think it would be most accurate to say that it is neither of the two, but more of a halfway stretch between both worlds. True, in considering the filming, music, and basic story line, it would be easy to label it as being \"European\", but the truth, as always, is always a lot more complicated than that. The movie treats every subject from relationships, to biases of different nationalities, from philosophy to gender contrasts. In nearly all of their conversations they end up agreeing on a halfway point of understanding. Were either of the two characters in their home country, it would have been a completely different story. But due to the fact that their meeting took place in a country equally foreign to both parties put them both at a disadvantage, and finally proved that, all dissimilarities notwithstanding, there's always a way of finding a satisfactory compromise that'll leave both parties even happier with the outcome than they had thought possible. If it were up to me, I'd have every European and American Company that had to work collaborate with one another watch the movie to demonstrate the fact that it is possible to get along, no matter how complicated it may seem at the beginning"}, {"rank": 181, "name": "Before Sunrise", "movie_year": "1995", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "This is a movie which to me brings out the best and worst in Film Making today.

Watching it then, I felt it was a well-written movie and an event that I would one day hope to experience myself. Watching it now as a person in my young/mid twenties, I realize that I've experienced a feeling very similar to this movie: Being independent and actually falling in love.That experience was brief, honest, and fulfilling, leaving an impression on me that I'll always remember. This film generates those same feelings for me, and watching this movie after my own experience, I can only see myself in Jesse's place, living out my own similar situations.This movie is one of the finest, most underappreciated (in my opinion) romantic stories of the '90's. It's a very real movie, and it's an accurate portrayal of what it feels like to meet someone who you just instantly \"click\" with. No gripping score, no dramatic good-bye only to be \"surprise\" reunited at the end. Before Sunrise portrays all of its messages with the sincere awkwardness of a beginning relationship, a bit of insightful conversation, and two people with similar views and interests finding each other. Delpy and Hawke don't play stereotypes in this movie. They play people, and that's what makes this film so interesting. The pacing of the film is slow, yet time seems to rush by. These are people you could actually meet. These people could actually be you.When Before Sunrise ends, there's no contrived, cheesy good-bye, it just ends, which is how life works. It leaves the possibilities open, but not in the way that you could see a sequel being made. If anyone has ever felt like this in a relationship, this movie will never ring truer than it does. For those who have yet to find that bit of spontaneous adventure, Before Sunrise is a good guide of what to look for.I can't recommend this movie highly enough.

Dialogue driven, the conversations Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy have aren't necessarily brilliant, but they're real. They discuss things anyone would discuss (family, friends, etc). The conversations are intriguing, however, and this draws us deeper into the film. Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke are completely natural in there roles. There is no acting her. They present these fictional characters honestly and openly. The thing I enjoyed most about this movie was how real it seemed.

One day I realized why; each time a conversation began -- something beyond \"Hi, mom!\" and waving -- the tape would cut and the next scene would begin.One begins to wonder -- does this person even LIKE people? Apparently the stuff of real life seems too dull for some, and they need Entertainment; the amperage on that entertainment has to keep going up and up, also, because we develop immunity toward all of our fixes. Thus, we wind up with ARMAGEDDON, GODZILLA, et al, or soap opera hysterics; everything pushing the envelope just so we can feel a little (and recognize a movie's cues to us).I thought BEFORE SUNRISE was great not as a reaction against that, but because it's so obvious Linklater and his actors give a hoot about human beings. Yes, some of the dialogue -- which is very, very sharply observed -- is silly and pretentious; these are kids who want to impress each other, like each other, and enjoy \"deep thoughts.\" It reminded me so much of college: that thrill of ideas, possibilities, yearnings.\nThe movie looks beautiful and is terribly romantic. Thank God Linklater is savvy enough to play out some conversations in long takes; a cumulative effect and rapport is built between Delpy and Hawke, their pinball game, and us. They're both movie-star beautiful, but for a while, they're just regular folk.Kubrick and Hitchcock may be better directors than say, Linklater or Levinson, but their cold formalism does make one wonder what grudge they hold against people. The Coens seem to be warming as well -- FARGO and THE BIG LEBOWSKI bespeak a new affection in their clever hearts.

But, every conversation between these too is greatly intriguing. What makes this pairing so romantic is how real it is. How in all that conversation, while often having no real bearing on anything critical, you can sense the nuances as these two become more fond and trusting of each other. This is exactly they way you would dream that you meet that special someone. And what makes it so true is that it is not even too fantastic to believe. This could be what would happen if you had been confident enough to strike up a conversation with that person you noticed somewhere random.

Miklos Rozsa has choreographed the traumatic flow of events with such a touching/revealing music score that enlivens the soul of all and sundry.The spectacular chariot race is a memorable and perfect piece of action ever to be filmed. In all its grandeur, the good thing is that Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd did most of their chariot racing by themselves except for a few dangerous stunts. The somersault of Ben Hur's chariot over the two fallen chariots is performed by (Chariot Action Director)Yakima Canutt's son Joe, who got slightly injured in his chin during the tossing over scene from the chariot's bogey. William Wyler has refuted any claims of a fatal casualty happening during the filming of this 11 minute spectacle.The screen presence of the lead actors (Charlton Heston, Stephen Boyd and Jack Hawkins) playing the characters of Judah Ben-Hur, Messala and Quint Aries is so deeply imbued with the cinematic flow of tumultuous events and coupled with excellent music and cinematography that the audience are bound to be hypnotized with its magnetic appeal unless a viewer has a puerile or immature imagination.BEN-HUR was filmed in 1958, released in 1959 and the story relates to a period, two thousand years back in time. However, the viewers will never loose its captivating and spellbinding appeal which circumvents mankind's quintessential values namely, hope and misery, faith and tyranny, humility and cruelty, forbearance and revenge, love and hatred and disease and death.The immense scope and scale of BEN-HUR can never be under-rated, although, it requires a deep insight for a keen eye to explore a most intricate play of historical drama depicted in this biblical epic.SOME WORDS ABOUT WILLIAM WYLER :What I can best say about Wyler is that he was a complete film making institution in his own person. He had the keen imagination and skill to effectively craft and portray sublimely moving and sentimental scenes which resonate the latent emotions and evocative thoughts of the audience.Moreover, he nurtured an excellent ability to translate symbolic emotional expression in an academic manner on the tinsel screen thereby at times, crafting spectacular melodramatic sequences that happen to be a valuable asset of the motion picture industry.Unlike, Hitchcock, he did not concentrate on picturing sudden/unusual/paranoid and metaphysical events to form the bedrock of his cinematic genius. Instead, he always focused on the more real-to-life human values while eying the big picture and rendered a forceful moral bottom line to enthrall the audience. Last but not the least, Wyler was able to craft a historically spectacular movie, which could not be equaled in its excellence by any director/producer up till now, in spite of handy computer effects/graphics and the many breakthroughs in filming techniques."}, {"rank": 183, "name": "Ben-Hur", "movie_year": "1959", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "I saw this movie when it first came out when I was about 7 yrs old and fell in love with Charlton Heston.

In the first his face shows hope for the future and in the second when Jesus looks at him, all the hatred and bitterness disappear forever.

And usually it takes a while for me to really accept movies and it takes a while before I really take them to me, this has been the case of almost every film I've ever seen.As for Ben-Hur, this is not the case. I am not at all amazed (or even impressed) by the many Academy Awards it received. As far as I'm concerned, if a film that wins eleven Oscars, then the only thing to be sure of is that it appeals to Americans and a great American crowd. And that's not always a good thing.Awards, nominations, hype and everything that has to do with frenzy put aside, this still is an enormous production. So very mighty and so very grand in scale, so very entertaining and so very well-made. We may never see the liking, the most of us have realized that we didn't see an equal in Titanic.Charlton Heston gives the character of Judah Ben-Hur all the magnitude it needs and he brings a strong impact. Many people are fond of Hugh Griffithin the role of Sheik Ilderiim for which he won an Oscar. I am too, but the most impressive actor of them all in my opinion is, Stephen Boyd as Messala. The scene where Ben-Hur and Messala speak to each other for the last time (the scene right after the chariot race) surely could have appealed enough to the American crowd to bring Boyd an Oscar. For a newcomer, he was an excellent and promising one.The movie itself in its full glory may be dated, but not enough for it to be ridiculous at any standard at all.

The strength of Charlton Heston's characterization of Judah Ben-Hur carries a lot of the weight, but is born not only from his acting, but from the original story. I've been thinking of Heston the NRA president lately, and didn't remember how boldly he plays compassion on the screen. Now, the whole reason i'm writing this comment: i can't even believe the chariot race. How it must have been filmed. And wrangled. And played. And edited. I am watching it again and again, to see the skill of the equine actors especially. And so gratified by the affectionate appreciation Judah Ben Hur gives his horses after the race. From the barren landscapes to the spare, beautifully photographed interiors, and then to the massive arena filled with spectators, this is a film to get the kids' imaginations into a reasonably depicted Roman Empire, into the history of conflicting cultures, and into human questions like loyalty and responsibility.

On TV this is just another dull close-up. By a hundred subtle transformations of this kind is Wyler's breathtaking work turned into stodge.This is particularly fatal because Ben-Hur had some tendency towards stodge to begin with. The portentous reminders of the divinity of Christ (`He says - he says he IS doing his father's work') are far too many and all of them stage-bound - and what do they REALLY have to do with the story of Ben-Hur, anyway? Even without the Christianity, Wyler leads us through each scene rather as if the story were some kind of museum exhibit.Only on the big screen does it emerge that this latter feature is a virtue rather than a vice. After all - at least it's a museum exhibit we're allowed time to contemplate. Had the film been made today we would have been hustled through in half the time, a long queue of impatient patrons behind us, none of us getting a good look at anything and all of us feeling short-changed.

Charlton Heston (Best Actor Oscar) delivers a tour de force performance as Judah Ben-Hur, the rebellious Jewish common man at the time of Christ. The story begins when Judah's best friend, the proud Roman Messalah, tries to persuade him to thwart any Jewish uprisings in Judea. When Messalah fears that Judah is a conspirator toward Rome, he forces Judah into slavery and his mother and sister into prison. Thus, Judah begins a long journey to locate his family and restore their dignity. The chariot race scene is impressive, but look closely for Heston's double.

This film is a true masterpiece and of epic standards.Charlton Heston gives a formidable performance in the title role. Could anyone have played it better? Highly unlikely. Heston's performance reminds me of his other great performance in \"The Ten Commandments\", powerful at most, however, showing compassion and a desire to help out his fellow man at other times. All supporting roles are played very well, including the spiteful Pontious Pilate. An interesting note to this film is the fact that the front of Jesus is never shown on camera. The audience only sees him from behind, perhaps because the filmmakers felt it unecessary to give any lines to a man who at many times was left unspoken.Ben-Hur was a pleasure to watch, especially in its widescreen format.

The sub title of the novel gives us a clue \"A tale of the Christ\". And until I became a Christian myself, the sheer magnitude and grandiosity of the production overshadowed this most important aspect: healing and forgiveness (which only Christ can give) in a time of paganism and worldliness embodied by the Roman overlords.Judah Ben-Hur goes on a tortuous, harrowing, life draining, gut wrenching journey of Roman barbarism thirsting for revenge. Put on a Roman galley to die by his boyhood friend, only his hate keeps him alive.When they meet for the last time at the end of the chariot race, Judah, having been touched twice by the healing hand of the carpenter, Jesus (whose face you never see), can already sense no feeling of accomplishment by the victory over a dying Messalah (he should have won an Oscar for the death scene alone).The culmination of the physical healing of his once leprous mother and sister (emblematic in the flow of blood from the cross into a stream of water) is one of the most moving in cinematic history.

Again the most lasting impression of \"On the Waterfront\" like Streetcar is Brando's performance. The film itself is about a longshoreman and ex-prize fighter who confronts the corrupt labour leaders who effectively run the dockers lives, in an attempt to expose their criminal practises. The film was hard hitting and controvesial in the subjects it dealt with such as racketeering and socialism and was wrongly accused of promoting communism and being anti American by unionists at the time. The film was shot in New Jersey and in black and white giving the film an authentic oppressed look and adding to the intensity of its subject.

Keaton grasps the full potential and beauty of cinema space - such as the cannon that after the fuse is lit slips downward to aim towards Keaton himself rather than the pursued train, but then (depicted in a single perfectly coordinated shot) encounters a bend in the track as it goes off, and so hits its intended target anyway. Keaton hardly ever gives himself a close-up (really just a couple of shots), but when he does it underlines his almost surreal impassivity - it's almost impossible here to think of him having a voice or a rounded character - not because he's flat but because he's somehow transcendent.

The General was one of the first silent movies that I was ever able to sit though long enough to fully appreciate the medium. It had everything, drama, comedy, action, romance. It was also pretty much true to the real event also. My favorite part is when Keaton has rescued the train and his girlfriend and they are escaping the federal troops in full pursuit. His girlfriend having run out of wood to stoke the engine hands him a twig. Keaton looks at the twig and thinks about hitting the girlfriend but instead hugs and kisses her. The other thing that I love about the movie is that there is not one second of wasted film, every scene has definite purpose and it holds your attention every minute.

He is old now and faced with his own inadequacy and impotence.Bergman introduces three young people into the drama to introduce life's most important question \u0096 that of the existence of God. The old man gives them a ride. One of the young men is thinking about becoming a parson; the other argues that God doesn't exist. The old man offers no opinion to the debate. He is silent, but it is a loud silence. It's a silence that reveals an amazing dimension of loss \u0096 the loss of year upon year of not coming to terms with this all-important question.In one of the final scenes, Bergman masterfully closes in tight on the aged face of Professor Isak Borg (played by Victor Sjostrom). In that shot, we can see the whole universe in his eyes and all of its cares in the bags beneath them. Only Bergman could have directed that scene \u0096 only him. It makes Smultronstallet one of the most important films ever made. That one scene, better than any other that I know, captures \u0091loss' on celluloid for all future generations to witness. If you see it, you may find yourself having to look away.The imagery in Smultronstallet is unparalleled, except by Bergman's own Sjunde inseglrt, Det (The Seventh Seal, 1957). Look for the handless watch, the corpse wagon, the sparseness of the first scene, the car windows turning to black \u0096 ominous signs are everywhere. Notice the clues that point to Bergman's existential philosophy (the twins write a song for a deaf man \u0096 as futile as Sisyphus' labor!) and the redemption themes (Izak pierces his hand as he looks into the window, or the line: `A doctor's first duty is to ask for forgiveness.'). Notice also the outright defiance of the divine presence that he has bred into his son (`I will not be forced to live one day longer than I want to.').Izak is ready to die, but it seems that, for him, life is more forbidding than death. He is a living corpse, dead already in nearly every way. All of these factors conspire to create a masterwork of pure art, and one that gets richer with each repeated viewing.The film is also cathartic in the sense that Greek drama was cathartic \u0096 a warning to the men of ancient Greece to avoid the tragic flaw that undoes the hero - and may be a fateful knock on the door of your undoing as well. Have we answered the question that Izak has not? If not, Izak is us. Look hard - very hard - at Izak. Do you like what you see? To quote a line from the film: `Is there no mercy?' `Don't ask me.'

Where some see slow pacing and wooden characters, I see brilliant devices that Kubrick used in order to prevent the undermining of the purely sensory elements of this film. Visually, it is unparalleled to this day, even by such recent masterworks as The English Patient or other classics such as Lawrence of Arabia. The matching of the soundtrack to the action on film is so exquisite as to defy description, almost as if each frame of the the film is blended with each note of the music. The performances, while understated, are still excellent, including leads Ryan O'Neal (Whom I do not like in any other movie) and Marisa Berenson as Lady Lyndon (The courtship scene between these two is perfect). Also, some of the more minor characters are very well portrayed, such as Captain Potzdorf, Lord Bullington and the Chevalier.This is quite simply Stanley Kubrick's finest film. Yes, it is a large investment of time. But if you choose to participate and let the film draw you in, those three hours are well spent. And while it is not a traditional action movie, if the last duel scene doesn't draw you in and captivate you, you need to check your pulse.

That is, the plot is not really a plot; the cinematography is unlike anything you've ever seen; the music (arranged and conducted by Leonard Rosenman) is entirely authentic to the period; and the performances, especially that of Ryan O'Neal, set a mood rather than tell a story. (The fact that Mr. O'Neal was willing to turn in such an innocuous performance at the pinnacle of his career speaks volumes for the star's character.)The point of this film is not in the script, it's in the overall experience. If you try to view it as a movie, it will fail you (or rather the other way around). But if you approach it as a work of art-- a wonderfully detailed painting combined with a fantastic symphony, you will enjoy it immensely.As with all of Kubrick's films, don't expect entertainment. This is art. That is why it gets such wildly mixed reviews. Where most of today's filmed entertainment is the cinematic equivalent of rock-n-roll, Kubrick's films are mostly waltzes. If you go into them expecting a patient, moving experience you will enjoy them tremendously; and this one above all.Barry Lyndon is the definition of the Art of Film.

I missed it when it appeared in the 1970's, and knew little about it. After recently viewing it, I believe it must be the most authentic- looking and beautiful period film ever made. You may learn about the plot from other reviewers, what I want to say about Barry Lyndon is that I feel it is Kubrick's overlooked masterpiece. It has been described by some as slow- moving and tedious, and was not well received by critics when released. However, I believe time will give Barry Lyndon the place of honor it deserves. I was overwhelmed by the attention to detail in both costume and set design in this film, it gave me a rare glimpse into the 18th century in a way that no other film has. There are scenes lit entirely by candle (a technique Kubrick perfected in Barry Lyndon) that are breathtaking and surprisingly crisp in detail. In terms of the use of the camera, the long shots of people in period settings share an eerie resemblance with the sensation one gets from the scene in 2001 when the man in the space suit enters the starkly decorated room and discovers himself at an advanced age. There is a wonderful impartiality here that is characteristic of so much of Kubrick's work. The same feeling was evoked by the panoramic views of Prussia and Ireland, views that provided visual markers along the way and which the camera held in its view for surprisingly long expanses of time before switching to the next scene. I found this technique, along with the landscapes, astonishingly beautiful. Though from an earlier period, the paintings and etchings of Breughel came immediately to mind. Among the most beautifully worked out scenes was a duel between Barry Lyndon and his step son, filmed in a chapel- turned- stable with doves flying around in the background and scattering at the sound of the gun shots. The scene in Ireland where Barry is held up by two somewhat educated and well- spoken highwaymen, who agree to let him keep his boots but not his money and horse, was especially noteworthy and wonderfully acted. Mention must be made of the beautiful period music used throughout the film and the subtle use of narration, telling us, at times, what is about to happen before it actually happens but never distracting us from the story. In the final scenes of Barry Lyndon we see him as a crippled and emotionally spent man. Even though we learn to despise him for his previous actions, we cannot help but have empathy for the man at the end. Schubert's piano trio opus 100 further tugs at our emotions in these final scenes. The piece is \"punctuated\" with the piano in a way that is both delightful and mournful, while the visceral impact of the film merges to mirror our understanding of Schubert as one of the greatest composers of his time. My one criticism is that even after watching the film 3 times, I had trouble knowing whether Ryan O'Neal's performance was emotionless and without depth, or whether this was the way Kubrick directed him. Oddly enough, it seems to work either way because the story is told not so much about Barry Lyndon but around him. Finally, mention must be made of the genius of a man like Stanley Kubrick, who could create a group of films so unlike in content-- 2001, A Clockwork Orange and Barry Lyndon to mention just 3-- all evoking an astonishing authenticity in terms of time and place, all brought vividly to life for the viewer.

He tackles a genre, sets a standard for it and then moves on. In Barry Lyndon, Kubrick offers a period piece that certainly raised the bar for that type of film, and perhaps set the standard for the Merchant-Ivory-type productions that would later follow.Barry Lyndon is based on the book by William Makepeace Thackery, and follows the life of its title character from poor beginnings in Ireland, through a stint in the 7 Year War and onto an opulent aristocratic lifestyle.Lyndon is an Irish stereotype; stubborn to the core, and willing to fight to the death for what he believes to be his. As a young man he forces a duel with a British officer who has come to his small village to marry Lyndon's first love. Later, Lyndon is a front line soldier battling the French. Throughout the movie, he encounters various people and events, each helping Barry, unwittingly of course, move up the social ranks. He is a prisoner of a Prussian captain, a spy to the British, and a card shark in European high society. Like most of Lyndon's work, this film moves slowly, taking the time to capture each and every detail. There are some marvelous scenes where characters sit frozen for minutes at a time. While they appear to be doing nothing, a lot is happening and the viewer is compelled to pay close attention. In one scene the camera pans out as Lyndon sits in a small boat on a small lake, gazing into the eyes of the woman he is courting. For two minutes the characters don't move, yet the viewer, caught up in the beauty of this scene, knows what is happening each and every step of the way.Stanley Kubrick has made his mark as one of the great directors by presenting his audience with intriguing visuals. For Barry Lyndon, Kubrick studied European art from the late eighteenth century and tried to bring some of those scenes to life in this film. As a result, we are presented with a mesmerizing tour de force, a visual delight! Eye candy ... not plain... and certainly not simple!Occasionally the viewer is awakened with a 'thud' realizing that this is more than just a pretty picture, there is actually a complicated plot going on here. The character of Barry Lyndon, played well by Ryan O'Neal, takes us on an interesting journey. Like real people, he has a multifaceted personality, and his behavior is shaped by the events that take place. At times we feel sorry for him, at times we look up to him, and at times we despise him.Kubrick made sexuality the key focus of films like Lolita and Eyes Wide Shut, but neither film evokes the passion contained in this effort. As he courts various women, Lyndon is violent and sexy. There are moments of homo-erotica that dare the viewer to wander. His dying uncle begs him for a kiss, for 'it will be my last' and we are witness to what might be a tender moment, but what seems like something else. There is nothing conventional about this film. There are no good guys and there are no bad guys. Everyone does what they do in a effort to survive. The viewer cannot predict what is going to happen next. It's best to sit back and enjoy the ride.

This is certainly an important plot element in Barry Lyndon, especially in the second half, where Barry resigns to his fate, and the viewer with him.

But after making another 180 degree turn, taking on the historical novel/costume drama, and coming up with something this brilliant and stunning, well then, now was the time for deification. Has any director ever made three masterpieces in a row that were as different and as totally unique as these three?One of the most beautifully photographed of all movies, the film canvases Kubrick creates are glorious, interiors and exteriors alike. It almost seems then to be an embarrassment of riches for the film to have such an engrossing story and vivid characters as well. As is usually the case in the man's films, the movie itself is the star and the actors, no matter how well they perform, tend to be subordinate. In another director's hands, 'Barry Lyndon' might have been a star vehicle for Ryan O'Neal and Marisa Berenson. Certainly they both do adequate jobs here in the best roles of their careers, but they can't help but be a little overwhelmed by the whole. Good performances in the supporting roles often get overlooked as well, for example those by Leon Vitali and Hardy Kruger, to name just two.Many have heard about the miracle Kubrick performed by filming this movie using only natural light or candlelight, but knowing or not knowing that wouldn't increase or decrease the viewer's enjoyment of this film one bit. Though he made two more excellent films after this one (with one more still to come!), 'Barry Lyndon' to me stands as Stanley Kubrick's last undisputed work of genius.

Thackeray's Barry Lyndon is a brash, swaggering, status-seeking rogue with a dynamic (but seriously faulted) personality, and an indomitable will who actively schemes, fights, and bullies his way through life. A true existentialist anti-hero. Kubrick's Barry Lyndon , played by Ryan O'Neal, couldn't be more different, even though he participates in some of the same activities as the character in the novel does. Kubrick's Lyndon has the demeanor of gentle choirboy: intensely quiet and soft-spoken with a penchant for long, earnest gazes (as is everyone in the film.) His personality is so completely vague and undefined that next to Thackeray's brilliantly extroverted protagonist, he is practically walking corpse. Thackeray's Lyndon is a man who compels our admiration (even affection) as well our contempt such is the force of his personality. Kubrick turns him into practically a non-entity who even at the end of this three hour film remains a paradoxical and annoying enigma. We learn nothing about what makes him tick because there is nothing there. I really found myself wondering if Kubrick actually read the novel - perhaps he got a synopsis from a script writer. Did they have Cliff Notes when this movie was made?! The film is steeped in an introspective, meditative atmosphere exemplified by the R. O'Neal character which is totally unsuited to the vigorous, ironic, and humorous tone of the novel. Kubrick has taken the fictional memoirs of a daring, villainous schemer and gambler and sucked all the energy and life out of them to make a tepid, pensive, piece of aesthetic boredom. The only scene that has any dramatic tension is the duel between Bullingdon and Lyndon which, ironically, is not in the novel. When adapting literature for the cinema doesn't a director have an obligation to the work's author to remain faithful to that author's artistic vision? It's understandable that some concessions must be made when moving between two such different mediums as literature and cinema; but to have such blatant disregard for the essence of the novel from which this film takes its title, Kubrick is guilty of artistic hijacking. It galls me to think that there are probably more persons living now who have seen Kubrick's bogus version of B.Lyndon than have read the novel; Kubrick, unfortunately, has had the last word because of film's cultural dominance. If a director wants to benefit from the cachet of using the title of a classic novel by an eminent author than he is obliged to remain faithful to that author's vision and not to utterly disregard it as Kubrick has done to such a wretched effect here."}, {"rank": 189, "name": "Barry Lyndon", "movie_year": "1975", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Some people are of that opinion that film is not to be considered art...

Nod to Kubrick's genius -- he does everything in the scene to alienate the audience from what's happening, and yet we're glued to it, gripping our seats, hoping that what happens won't happen, heaving a collective groan of pain when it does.And, on top of all that, the entire film was shot only with light sources available within the period it takes place -- i.e., candles, candles, candles, or the sun. It was a bold experiment in the early days of fast film, and it works; moreso than almost any film set in the period, we are there. (The only thing that gets close that I can think of off hand is \"Revolution,\" the underrated Al Pacino venture from the early 80s -- but it derives its \"you are there\" from historical accuracy and detail.)Anyway, this is all the long way about of saying that \"Barry Lyndon\" is worth a second look, and a third -- and definitely a first if you've never seen it. Don't let the length scare you, because the story will grab you so fast, you won't notice. Don't let Ryan O'Neal scare you, because everything unlikeable about him works to the advantage of the story here...And, finally, for you \"Clockwork Orange\" fans -- watch carefully, my droogies, because the structure of \"Barry Lyndon\" mirrors the structure of \"A Clockwork Orange\" perfectly -- and yet tells us an entirely different tale."}, {"rank": 189, "name": "Barry Lyndon", "movie_year": "1975", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "One of my favorite movie director is Stanley Kubrick.

Kubrik's forte has always rested on his thematic storytelling and eccentric camera-work. Though intricately plotted and lavishly produced, the film suffers from these same excesses. The first 'part' of the film is a complete bore, without any of Kubrik's wit and imagination. However, it is considerably lifted when the lovely Marisa Berenson appears as the Countess of Lyndon. Her courting scene is one of the most hypnotic, expertly filmed sequences in cinema history. The rest of the performances are adequate at best, and Kubrik's vision is still wonderful to watch.

Some terrific scenes include the beginning, when Gerry and his friends are chased by British soldiers after being mistaken for IRA snipers, the trial in London, the prison scenes (which expose the loneliness and honesty of the characters rather than the crude violence and gang rapes of so many other pathetic prison movies), and of course the powerful ending, where the marvelous dramatic talents of all the actors are evinced in a final crescendo.

The Deer Hunter is a deeply flawed examination of the lives of three Pennsylvania steelworkers who enlist, serve in 'Nam, and suffer the consequences. This is a great film when the actors are allowed to take centre stage: Robert De Niro was becoming America's greatest film actor, Christopher Walken was establishing himself as a brilliant young talent, and even the woman I love to hate, Meryl Streep, delivered a stunningly nuanced performance. The supporting cast is near flawless, and it's always a delight to see Shirley Stoler in any film, even when she's playing a Serbian mama.\nThe Deer Hunter suffers when director Michael Cimino's need to make a statement and screenwriter Deric Washburn's need for a cinematic metaphor overwhelm what could have been a terrific straightforward story. Cimino's recurring use of the hunting theme is totally over the top, especially when the Serbian church music swells in the background as De Niro stalks his prey. The symbolism in The Deer Hunter is unnecessary and so in your face as to be a major distraction. As for Washburn, all one can say is that he obviously never met a Vietnamese he didn't hate. To say his depictions of Vietnamese are racist is perhaps an understatement: they are shown as either brutal butchers who have nothing better to do than torture prisoners and shoot civilians, or jabbering idiots who gamble endlessly on the other overworked symbol of the film, Russian Roulette. The fact that The Deer Hunter was shot in Thailand--an American ally to the end of the Indochinese Wars--makes me guess that the Thai crew and actors were more than happy to present their Communist neighbours to the East as maddened animals. All the better to keep Thailand within the realm of American national interests, I imagine. By all means see this film for De Niro and Walken. Try and ignore the sound and the fury, and focus on the brilliance of their performances.

The casting is fantastic, each actor works to their extreme.The lack of the usual Hollywood melodramatic approach and political correctness is extremely welcome here, as it gives the audience a lot of room for it's own judgements.

Deniro, fresh off of his Academy Award for Godfather II, is brilliant as Michael, and Walken rightfully wins Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Nick.The story revolves around a close group of steel workers in the blue collar town of Clairton, PA. Three of the six men are off to Vietnam in a few days, and the film examines the effect of major stress on their friendships. Michael is the quiet leader of this group, and he joins Nick and Steven in Vietnam. Before they make that journey, Steven gets married. The remaining five men go on one final hunting trip together, the \"Deer Hunter\" being Deniro's character. Here we learn of Michael's one shot philosophy when hunting deer. One shot - an important theme of the film.The first half of the film is devoted to outlining their lives in that mill town. The complications that come with everyday life, the intricacies of friendship, trust, love, fear, confusion, and Rolling Rock. Once in Vietnam, the men undergo changes that will alter their lives forever.The roulette scenes which make this film famous may be entirely fictitious. It does not matter. Cimino presents them in such a realistic and powerful manner that you cannot help getting caught up in the scenes. Particularly toward the end of the film, you will find your heart racing. This movie was one of the first films involving Vietnam, yet the film is not about war. It is about the effect of war and stress on a friendship and how some things can never be the same.I give this film 9 stars out of 10, with a point deducted for a mediocre final scene. The score is powerful, the cinematography is exceptional for the seventies.In a final note, John Cazale, most notable as Fredo Corleone, gives a great performance as Stan, the weak and nearly pathetic friend of Michael.

Michael (De Niro) is the loner, perfectionist and survivalist. Nick (Walken) is the social leader, mediator, and provider of all that is a social human being - man as a member of a larger society. The initial wedding scene (long touted as unnecessary) is critical to setting up the initial contrast between the two characters (Nick orchestrating the wedding reception, Mike at the bar watching from afar). As the movie unfolds, the contrast becomes stronger. Michael believes in \"one shot\" while hunting; Nick hunts because of the beauty of nature (\"I like the trees\"). Michael would rather punish someone for forgetting their boots to a hunt; Nick's nature is to help them. Mike's first instinct is to abandon a dying friend (Steven) in the prison camp; Nick stops this act of inhumanity.Without giving away the end (for the few that haven't seen the movie), we ultimately see that, pushed to an extreme in the war, the laissez faire instincts of Mike become extinguished (pivotally on Mike's last hunt with his famous \"OK\" words to a 10-point buck, relinquishing to the notion that man is indeed a social being), only to spend the last one-third of the movie mending his past. Nick, in essence boycotts life, refusing to abandon his \"humanness\" as the war requires, ultimately rebuffing Michael and his notion of humanity in the famous \"one shot\" Russian roulette scene.As far as immensely thought-provoking films go (and not including the obscure art house independent films), The Deer Hunter stands on top of just about all of them.

The Vietnam War destroyed that myth for millions of Americans, both civilians and soldiers. The war exposed the U.S. as the imperial-capitalist exploiter that it is.

Through tumultuous and gut-wrenching predicaments such as their imprisonment at a Vietcong Camp, these mortals must understand the meaning of the word \"survival.\" The human spirit must learn to triumph over all adversity. To be headstrong, is to win...The costs of the Vietnam War for each of these three individuals is unremitting. One of these men's minds becomes off balance. Another becomes a cripple. It is also sad that one of these souls may not return home as a hero...THE DEER HUNTER is an absorbing and manipulative piece which overpowers the viewer. The direction is taut and the performances are so splendidly real and commendable. From De Niro to the underrated John Savage, each actor does a superior job convincing the viewers about why he behaves this way and what compels him to make each decision.

Many scenes, such as the unbearable Russian Roulette scene and the imprisonment camp, are brilliantly captured on screen.THE DEER HUNTER is such a symbolic movie. For example, when looking into Mike's eyes just before he aims to shoot at a hapless deer, the viewer can see the remorseless, yet he can see the concentration Mike has as he tries to hit his target. This only shows how over-competent Mike can be before reality sinks in... The wedding scene in the beginning shows how much friends give a damn about each other. Last, the transitions with the characters from a happy-go-lucky nonchalant attitude to a state of mental disillusionment and non-stability will stagger the human mind...THE DEER HUNTER is a profound portrait of an American's perspective of the Vietnam War...and the aftermath. Each of the three characters learns only too well that there is no real glory in war, only suffering. THE DEER HUNTER does a magnificent job showing the individual effects of war on each of the main characters involved.What makes this film even more remarkable is that unusually, THE DEER HUNTER does not focus on the atrocities of the Vietnam War itself even if the film shows the unthinkable violence of the Vietnam Conflict. It is not a tale about heroism either. Rather, THE DEER HUNTER is a story about courage, and the ability to stay strong. They (Mike, Nick, and Steve) learn that their sanity must stay healthy in an insane world. If a soldier is unable to maintain his composure during war, then he will most likely feel the effects of this war, even if it is already over. As noted before, keeping faith in oneself is a necessity to surviving. THE DEER HUNTER offers more than a standard war story. It is a compelling, complex study of the human being under pressure. THE DEER HUNTER deals with emotions. The souls who cannot stay cool under any situation will eventually breakdown afterwards...\nAnother theme in this movie is that a person must cope with the choices made. The person has to live with the decision he has selected, regardless of the guilt that may overburden him subsequently with the judgment chosen...There is so much to recommend in THE DEER HUNTER. The poignancy of this movie will torment your own conscience forever. The tension is always prevalent in this fierce motion picture. There is a lot to be learned from this movie, but the important message is that amid all of the chaos and violence that may exist in this world, the ones who can learn how to stay mentally stable will prevail. Enduring hardships will only make you a stronger person...

It is split up into 3 different sections, the pre-war section with a wedding and hunting scene, the war section with the famous and haunting Russian Roulette scene and the post-war section. The film is long, but not too long in that it develops the characters, puts them through hell, and then lets you see their reactions to it after its over. Robert De Niro (Raging Bull, Cape Fear) is outstanding as the natural leader of the friends. Meryl Streep (Kramer Vs. Kramer, One True Thing) is great as one of the best friends of the group. Finally, Christopher Walken (Suicide Kings, The Prophecy) gives a haunting and shattering performance as the member of the group who becomes the most messed up and can't make himself come home.

The fact that its re-interpretation of Vietnam has been so easily accepted by the vast majority of viewers makes it scarier. I don't want to write my dissertation on the danger of cinema remaking history, but when you watch this film ask some critical questions about what it is saying to viewer about the past. E.g. Why are the Americans always the victims of Asian aggression? Why is the political/social/historical aspect of the conflict completely excluded (We see Saigon falling, but are not asked to see our role in the ensuing chaos)? Why is the tragedy of Vietnam exclusively its corruption of innocent American boys, over and over and over again?

This is the meanest Vietnam, or argueably, the meanest war film that has ever been made or ever will be made(that was until \"Saving Private Ryan\" came out). The acting is superb in getting the feeling of misery and pain across to the audience. James Cameron's \"TITANIC\" seems fake in how the actors portray their terror, pain, and suffering.

And the thing that's strange is, this film isn't even about the Vietnam war. It's about how it affected, or wrecked the lives of the people who went through it!

I did, sort of. It definitely could have been better.In particular, the infamous wedding scene. I have no problem with long scenes: I'm a Tarkovsky fan. But they must have a point, either character development, or else setting a mood. As I see it, the wedding scene did neither. It could have been cut much shorter without losing any of its effect, and that time could have been used to give greater insight into the life of the town and the relationships between Walken, DeNiro, Streep et al.So the wedding finally ends, and almost instantly we're plunged into Vietnam and into \"the scene.\" I didn't clock it, but I would bet that the wedding lasted almost as long or longer than their entire actual war experience. What was Cimino thinking? He was obviously striving for some sort of jarring contrast, but it didn't work at all. It just seemed sloppy to me. It was like a B-grade Coppola ripoff followed by something from an entirely different film, like Cimino had been watching TV and changed channels while taping. I understand that that was the point. It just wasn't done well.Then the rest of the film is based on the trauma of Vietnam and how this affected the characters. That's fine, but it's built on just one scene. It's a tribute to \"the scene\" that this works at all. It is very poor writing and editing though in my opinion.The remainder of the film is enjoyable, though ponderous at times, particularly the hunting scene. I did appreciate the treatment of DeNiro coming home. Excellent understatement. Just showing him having conversations with his friends, asking how they're doing, and having them say Oh same as always was fantastic. It wasn't sententious or melodramatic. Kudos on that.The Deer Hunter seems like a half-finished sculpture. There are beautifully chiselled sections broken up by large chunks of untouched rock. The effect is very uneven. I guess the best way to sum it up is inconsistently poignant.While The Deer Hunter is a solid film, it's not the best Vietnam movie, as it can't compare to the inexorable emotional intensity of Apocalypse Now, nor am I certain it was even the best movie of its year."}, {"rank": 191, "name": "The Deer Hunter", "movie_year": "1978", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "I love watching the Deer Hunter.

I can't think of another movie in which a close community has been represented so real, so convincing. The Deer Hunter really takes its time observing these people, living their ordinary lives. Some viewers complain that these scenes are much too long, that there isn't happening enough. I don't share their opinion. The strength of this movie lies in the fact that you know the three friends, that you empathize with their feelings and their way of thinking. And all this is accomplished thanks to this first, absorbing hour.The Russian Roulette-scene is very famous. When I first saw it, not yet 20 years old, I was extremely shocked by it. Never before had I seen such brutal violence in a movie. The tension is so perceptible. The confusion, felt by Nick. The heart-rending fear of Steven. The almost maniacal determination of Michael to get them out.I'm twice as old now. Lots of movies I liked when I was 20, lost its power of attraction as I grew older. But not The Deer Hunter. The Russian Roulette-scene still is one of the most compelling pieces of movie I've ever seen.When Michael returns to the United States we witness several other great scenes. Because the first hour gave us the opportunity to get to know the friends who stayed behind in the US, we now understand the enormous gap between them and Michael. Although it never becomes overly sentimental, Michael's coming-home is an emotionally shattering piece of movie.The actors all are sublime. Lesser actors never could have shown us this much, with so few means. It's absolutely great how they created these real, convincing characters. I'm still amazed that Jon Voight won the Oscar for best actor. I'm sure lots of actors could have created his role in \"Coming Home\" as good as he did. But very few are capable to do what Robert De Niro did in The Deer Hunter, it's his best role ever. I also was touched by the hardly ever mentioned part of George Dzunda, who played John. It was small, but great!Unfortunately, I also do have some comment. I really can't understand how Nick could possibly have sent money to Steven. Neither of them knew the other one was alive. Nick never could have known where Steven was staying. I think this is an enormous blunder in the script. I also had some difficulty with the last scenes in Saigon. When you consider what chaos Saigon was in at that moment, the events happening there weren't very realistic.If these flaws wouldn't have been there, I surely would have given The Deer Hunter 10 out of 10.

However, it was not able to create an overall mood of other films typical of the genre. This may be due to my dislike of the score, which interrupted the growth of tension or intrigue, rather than enhancing it. Overall, the acting was pedestrian.As a mild excuse, the copy of the film was poor, and the sound quality substandard. I would like to see this film again, in a theater if possible, but certainly, a better print couldn't hurt."}, {"rank": 193, "name": "The Third Man", "movie_year": "1949", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "This movie contains one of my all time favorite scenes in movie history; the brilliantly choreographed sewer chase.

Considering that Cotten gave one of his more uninspired performances(paled in comparison to his performance as Eugene Morgan in the \"Magnificent Ambersons\"), I still think that this film stands alone as the greatest post-war film ever made. The zither score is one of the most uniquely mesmerizing and surprisingly fitting music scores I have ever heard, and it set the tone for the villainous and conniving atmosphere of post-war Vienna. I love the odd angled shots.....the terribly dark shadows...the realistic sets that exposed the hard-nosed reality of post-war Europe. The plot itself was laced with suspense(Harry's entrance), drama(harry's final \"nod\" to Holly on the sewer staircase), and comedy(the name mixups..Holly-Harry...Winkle-Vinkle...Calloway-Callahan). Allida Valli gives an admirable performance as Harry's longtime girlfriend who is willing to put his death to rest even under the suspicious circumstances with which he died. EVERY last character that Holly meets in Vienna has an aura of evil...down to the little boy chasing his ball. But the truth behind the whole twisted plot and demonic characters is that they all lead to the \"meat\" of the movie....the greatest entrance ever...harry Lime's. The dark shadow keeps the viewer uneasy, even if it is more than obvious that it is Harry. Welles brief role elevates the \"Third Man\" into the upper echelon of films.....HIS ferris wheel sequence is the most well written scene EVER....the \"cuckoo-clock\" monologue was devastating filmwriting...Welles encapsulates EVIL as Harry Lime. A character is at his best when he can make EVIL look so appealing as Welles displayed ever so brilliantly. The closing sequence could not have been better, with the lovestruck Holly awaiting his \"still in love\" Anna....but getting the \"shaft\". A must see for all serious film-goers.... A REQUIREMENT for all Orson Welles fans. Only 9 years later we would see Welles maybe 80-100 lbs heavier in \"Touch of Evil\", so this is a sort of farewell to the leaner Welles(even though his progressive weight gain from \"Kane\" is apparent).

Both take place in wartime, but the Vienna of \"The Third Man\" is a cynical and no-nonsense world of post-war recovery. \"Casablanca\" gives us romantic hope, \"The Third Man\" gives earthly despair. But everything from the black and white frames to the blatantly melodious music to the brilliant cast (Joseph Cotten, Trevor Howard, Alida Valli, and Orson Welles) and direction suggest that portraying the hard knocks of reality may be comforting too. \"The Third Man\" is foremost a film about catching a scoundrel but the telling of this tale is far more interesting from the imaginative cinematography of shadows and slants and quick takes of ordinary people to the playfulness of this quirky story by novelist Graham Greene. How can you throw in odd pieces like a parrot, a finicky cat, and a little boy who just wants someone to play ball with him and make it an integral part of a film? How can mispronounced or misnamed characters bring out laughter at the most inappropriate times? How ever in the world can such lines like \u0091any friend of Harry's is a friend of mine', \u0091you ought to find a girl of your own', \u0091all the Swiss have to show for their 500 years of democracy is a cuckoo clock?', and \u0091be sensible Martins \u0085 I haven't got a sensible name' have such powerful suggestions. In the hands of a master like Carol Reed, \"The Third Man\" is a film without redundancy and without unnecessary action nor dialogue. It is slim and it is trim. As an example, the mysterious Harry Lime doesn't show up until the last half of the film but his subsequent appearances are so anticipated and his character so dominating you feel you have experienced him much more. \"Casablanca\" gave us the famous last scene at the airport and \"The Third Man\" is equal to that with the haunting walk from the cemetery.

Later, as he rationalizes his crimes for Martens (Joseph Cotten) during a Ferris wheel ride, he is the epitome of post-war cynicism. The relationship between Welles's and Cotten's characters in this film reminded me of their roles in \"Citizen Kane\", where Cotten has to state the truth or remain loyal to a friend. Other images remain with me after viewing - the loud-mouthed little boy accusing Martens of murder, the old balloon seller appearing out of the night, and the eerie, hypnotic zither music forever in the background.

It has lived in my memory ever since for the power of its evocation of a battle-scarred, shadowy and frightening city whose decadence is expressed in the baroque magnificence of the stove in Anna's flat and in the incongruous polished pedestal of the column to the left in Calloway's office. A place where nothing and no-one can be trusted. A place of echoing and empty streets among ruins whose doorways and passages conceal incomprehensible menace.A recent second viewing confirmed, reinforced and enhanced my admiration. From the first strum of the zither to the final shot of Anna walking past Martins as she leaves the cemetery, the film exercises a total grip on the senses. The plot was as I remembered it, the detail this time threw up the themes of names/identity - Dr Winkel/Vinkel, Holly/Harry, Calloway/Callaghan - the theme of laughter: Anna's role as an actress in the play (\"They only do comedy\"), Harry's telling her she laughed too much, Holly's delight at her rare smile - and, above all, the pervasive air of pure and inescapable sadness, a quality rarely captured on film.I had forgotten how the appearance of the horrible child round the doorway in pursuit of his ball prefigures the first appearance of Harry Lime, preceded by the cat. Two apparently round, innocent faces - one presaging betrayal and the other evil. Death and destruction affecting thousands - the outcome both of war and of the criminal activities which follow in its wake - form the nervous backdrop, visual and narrative, to the film: yet there is only one on-screen killing. The tension of the scene in the sewers, the echoes, the shadows and the agonising confrontation of Harry and Holly provide the finest climax of any thriller I have seen. The credit has to be shared equally among Carol Reed, Robert Krasker and Graham Greene."}, {"rank": 193, "name": "The Third Man", "movie_year": "1949", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "The life of the avid film-goer can actually be a depressing, disillusioning thing. After the initial gleeful devouring of the canon (about 300 movies), and the joyous stumbling over the odd undiscovered gem, the cineaste must be content with an endless trail of largely diminishing returns. The only counter against this is brilliant films which never disappoint on the 18th viewing, such as Vertigo, The Wizard Of Oz, The Wild Bunch... ...and The Third Man, a film containing such multitudes that it makes you forget that the majority of British cinema is parochial, unambitious, self-satisfied rubbish. A great film is by definition a labyrinth: whatever your mood, be it emotional or intellectual, you pick up a new thread of interpretation, and find yourself in places you've never been before, yet by the end, everything still doesn't quite fit, and you have to begin again. And you know that there is nothing in the world you want to do more.This time around, I noted the theme of authority and authoriality. Authors write books, and have total control over their characters and narrative. Authorities (less obviously) have the same power over the people they govern. These two concepts make up the film's two quests, which in reality is only one. Our hero, Holly Martins, is a novelist, who continually claims that he will write the story he is actually participating in. Calloway is the authority (as morally detached as any modern writer) with the similar quest to find Harry Lime. And yet it is Harry who is the real author of the plot: everything happens to his plan, his power is otherworldly - he is truly godlike, without body (being dead). When we finally do see him, he is lit like a devil, or surveying Vienna like a deity. The opening credits show us a zither playing a tune, but we don't see who's playing it. And who is the jovial black marketeer, who narrates the opening montage, and then vanishes from the film? When Harry dies, the story ends, reaches the deadlock of the astonishingly, bravely bleak closing scene.The Third Man is that rare film - perfect in every way, a popular narrative entertainment capable of holding great moral, artistic, philosophical, but most importantly, emotional weight. Joseph Cotten gives the greatest male lead performance in all cinema, yet it is Orson Welles, as the story's author, whose boyish charm, and weary, nihilistic evil must drive the film, even in his absence.The movie is incredibly bleak - about people, about art, but it doesn't seem that way. The whole thing plays like a Nabokovian black comedy (Harry Lime IS Humbert Humbert) - genuine terror frequently slips into farce, and vice versa. The smooth, coherent narrative is always disrupted by non-sequiters and wild goose chases. Karas' score prefigures those of Morricone's spaghetti westerns, in his use of music not as a subliminal dramatic accompaniment, but as an ironic Brechtian commentator on the action, yet also sympathetic and yearning. Vienna is filmed as a sunken ship. Like Lolita, the film is obsessed by doubles (Holly and Harry, Holly and Calloway etc.), but, also like Lolita, this doubling is parodied, and there is no hope in resolution. The closure of the 'male' detective story is confounded by the hero's lack of progress in the romantic plot. Despite the film's cynicism, I was in tears when it ended, my ethics torn to shreds. I love The Third Man, and have so much to say about it (I love the demonisation of children - South Park is spiritually indebted to Greene)I could write a book. Do yourself one favour in your life and watch it; you'll never have to fall in love again.

This wonderful example of classic noir is one of the all time greatest films. It combines amazing visuals, sounds, dialogue, and acting to tell a thrilling story and comment about the atmosphere after WWII.Of all the movies durring the studio era (pre-1960ish), there are three movies with cinematography that always stick out in my mind: Gregg Toland's work in Citizen Kane, Russel Mety's work in Touch of Evil, and Robert Krasker's work in The Third Man (all starring Orson Welles funny enough). I just recently saw a restored 35mm version of The Third Man. The crisp black and white visuals of a bombed out Vienna are so breath-taking. Shadows are everywhere. The unique way Krasker tilts the camera in some shots adding to the disorientation of the plot. And who can forget the first close-up of Welles with the light from an apartment room above splashing onto his face; one of the great entrances in movie history (Lime gives his old friend a smile that only Welles could give).The cinematography is backed by strong performances by Welles, Cotten, and italian actress Vali. The writing of Greene is wonderful; you can see the plot twisting around Cotten tightly. But what makes The Third Man so great is its historical commentary (well not really historical since it was commenting on its own time, but to us it is historical). On one level The Third Man is a story of betrayal and corruption in a post-war, occupied Vienna. On the other hand, its giving the audience a glimpse of the mood of Europe after the great war. The uncertainty that the Cold War was bringing is evident through out the film; Cotten is constantly trying to figure out who to trust. Vienna is on the frontier of the new communist bloc (we even see the communists infiltrating Vienna trying to bring Vali back to her native Czechoslavakia). The zither music score combined with the stark images of bombed out Vienna are reminiscent of the frontier towns of American Westerns.

Halfway through the film I wish there had been a way to shut the music off and keep the dialogue on! The best thing about this is the direction. Director Reed constantly keeps the viewer off balance by shooting numerous scenes at a tilted angle establishing a sense of paronia and uneasiness. Very rarely is something shoot at the correct angle. Also, the set design is stunning. The movie is set in Vienna, but was shot in London. You'd never know it. It looks and FEELS like Vienna. The sets are huge and crumbling (result of WWII) and increase the feeling of dread. Also excellent use of night and shadow. Some of these sequences wouldn't be out of place in a horror film.

Setting aside the admittedly dazzling photography and editing, we have a plot that's as difficult to follow and riddled with holes and loose ends as the one for \"The Big Sleep.\" If we assume that Harry Lime is the \"third man\" who drove the truck that killed the medical orderly that was informing on him to the police (in fact, this is never made clear), wouldn't it have been a simple matter for the authorities (or anyone else) to identify the body and discover that it was not Harry Lime? Didn't the police interview the driver of the truck? How could Lime and his cohorts have possibly gotten away with the faking of his death when he was the most notorious and sought after racketeer in Vienna? The pretext for Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) being in the city at all is awfully weak. (The narration mentions a vague \"some sort of a job.\") Why would Harry want a friend from America that he hasn't seen for 10 years to come to Vienna to write about his operations? The less publicity the better it would seem to me. It's also extremely ambiguous whether or not his mistress (Alida Valli) knew that Harry was dead. The first time that Martins sees Lime he's lingering outside her apartment house as if waiting to go in, and then she does everything she can to make sure that Harry eludes the authorities. In fact, her obtuse behavior throughout the film is baffling. (I'm inclined to believe that she was in on the whole deception.) Perhaps Carol Reed and co. needed audacious cinematic razzle-dazzle and oblique dialogue to cover up the fact that their story makes minimal sense. And that jangling zither music!

I have a list of similar favorite films, and it is hard to rank them in order of preference (it often depends on my mood, so many are equally great).Here are a few reasons:1) \"The Third Man\" is the most outstanding reason for why I love to go to the movies. It welds images, sounds, dialogue and music into my memory, my personality, and my soul. When I think of why I love the cinema, I think of this film as an example.2) Joseph Cotten. The man has a screen presence wrought not from the elements which make other \"Great\" actors like Laurence Olivier, Humphrey Bogart or Jimmy Stewart, but from his own normalcy. He is Joseph Cotten, a nice guy, someone you'd like to have speak for you at a college admissions board or at a traffic court. He's the kind of guy you hope your new girlfriend's dad is like. He's not just \"nice\", either, in a Cary Grant way. We actually like the guy. And it is this niceness which hurts us most when we see what he must do.3) Alida Valli. She was in the 1977 hidden treasure \"Suspiria\", but otherwise dropped from view after this film, in which she blasted through a handicap (that accent) with the most affecting female performances of all time--we love her and hate her, because she's the unrequited love to end all unrequited loves.4) Orson Welles. He's such a convincing bad guy, but he's the coolest. In the pantheon of directors, he was sometimes overlooked as an actor, but here he tops them all. He almost has us taken by his scheme, and we doubt the movie (and Major Calloway) will be able to counter him. It does, nearly, and he becomes both the despicable rat villain and the glorious rebel martyr at the same time.5) The zither score.6) The final shot."}, {"rank": 193, "name": "The Third Man", "movie_year": "1949", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "The Third Man is the most perfectly executed movie I have ever seen.

They dared to show things not in their most pretty way, but in their most desperate form. It allows us to really feel the tension of \"the pre-coldwar\" in Vienna. I think Joseph Cotton is such a natural actor; he never forces his lines or attempts to overact. All of his lines are said with clarity and conviction of character. He is as likable an actor as Jimmy Stewart. By far however, my favorite part of the film is the ferris wheel ride. Orson Welles could provide such a menacing presence. Here the subtlety of his acting (as in The Stranger) added to the tension. Was he going to throw his friend out of the ride? His eyes revealed his character so delicately. The subtle glances and narrowed eyes conveyed his potential for evil. It is amazing to me too, with cameras having been so bulky, that they were able to shoot the subterranian world of the sewer.

The owner of an American-based fuel company offers the men $2 000 to transport 2 truckloads of nitroglycerin over a 300 treacherous-mountainous miles.

Director Henri-Georges Clouzot adapted the screenplay from a novel by Georges Arnaud, creating a totally realistic world full of poverty and despair. The people living in this wretched part of the world aren't fazed, however, as their spirits remain strong. The principal's efforts to rise above it all, though heroic, prove ultimately fatal. Clouzot creates a couple of tremendously unforgettable scenes: the men pushing their trucks over dilapidated bridges, across mountains, broken down roads, and an oil well. Like no other film since we feel the desperation and dismay the characters go through. The ending is a bit of a letdown, further reinforcing Clouzot's pessimistic nature.QUOTE: Jo: \"I'm trying to remember. The fence. . .what there was behind the fence.

The beginning paints a picture of a world unimaginable to anyone from a developed country, of corruption, poverty, and oppression. It simultaneously describes the main characters - a bunch of immigrants who have strayed to this miserable little town, and for whom there is little chance of escape from the baking heat and unemployment. There is Mario, the happy-go-lucky scrounger, Luigi, his hard-working Italian pal, the comically tyranical tavern owner, his much abused maid, and Jo, the suave and dangerous French gangster. Homosexuality, racism, and the oppression of women figure prominently, but are never commented upon directly, as various prison motifs are evident in the lighting and set construction. Suddnly there is a change - a way out for a 'lucky' four of the deadbeats. There has been an explosion at an oil well on the other side of the mountain. The oil company needs to put out the fire with explosives, which are stored in the town. But its nitro-glycerine, and there is no time to get specially-fitted trucks to carry it over the rough mountains roads. Rather than risk their own employees, the oil company offers a large reward to four volunteers.

On the journey their true characters emerge. One, Jo, is broken by the ordeal, but is eventually redeemed.

Fate seems to be stacked against these bedraggled heroes, but it is their ingenuity, effort and bravery which captures our hearts.

Stewart only wins his cause, after all, through a rather abrupt, bizarre crack-up by Rains - something of a deus ex machina that leaves the corrupt jungle largely unscathed. Of course, it could hardly be otherwise, but the movie might have aged better had it acknowledged the limitations of its story.

Jimmy Stewart's innocence and idealism are not portrayed as something unusual or freakish for us to stare at, but as the natural condition of every American not warped and twisted by greed and love of power. In that sense, the hero is entirely at home in the movie, though an outsider in Washington; we feel that through Jefferson Smith, we are experiencing the real America. Stewart is wonderful from starry-eyed beginning to exhausted, verge-of-a-breakdown end; he is a hero we can whole-heartedly cheer for. Claude Rains is superb as the fallen \"silver knight\" Joe Paine; it is clear throughout that we are looking at the ruins of a great man, and we share his humiliation when we see him in the degrading company of the triumphant press tycoon. Though the ending has been faulted for being too sudden, I find it very powerful.Although I am not an American, I always get choked up during the famous montage section of patriotic historical landmarks that Smith visits on his first day in Washington. The nobility of the images combined with the stirring music produces a very moving experience. This is a wonderful movie, and despite its period enthusiasm, it is not at all sentimental, if one employs the definition of sentimentality as \"loving something more than God does\". I believe its enthusiasm and zeal are on the side of things like truth, honesty, and goodwill - things that everyone, including God, would join in loving."}, {"rank": 198, "name": "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington", "movie_year": "1939", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "It is no wonder director Frank Capra has inspired the likes of Oliver Stone, Martin Scorsese and many other filmmakers who depict everyday hypocrisy in some of their work. MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON oozes with patriotism and idealism, with corruption around the borders. Jimmy Stewart does not \"belong\" in Washington, but the incredulous \"Jefferson Smith\" will not accept the limits put on freedom, hence Stewart's greatest performance. This is Capra's most idealistic work, a film he seemed to prepare for the upcoming test the United States would be put to in just two years in World War II. Modern day viewers will no doubt see the dated elements in Capra's presentation of our country's mores. I felt awe and a new sense of patriotism in the montage of images from D.C. that I wish I could still completely believe in. Time has told us we can't. \"Jeff Smith\" would be crushed in today's political climate, but it is a beautiful thing to see this David and Goliath fight take place in the form of a Senatorial filibuster.Capra's direction is so forward and compelling in showing the once bright-eyed Mr. Smith's realization of what he is up against. Even in the 1930's, there were \"political machines\" led by mobsters or businessmen. Stewart is the best at showing emotion through his facial gestures. His weepy breakdown in he and Capra's equally brilliant ITS A WONDERFUL LIFE is similar to Mr. Smith's 23 hour filibuster. He is everyman and isn't that who we wish was passing and signing bills in this country? Jean Arthur is sweet as \"Saunders\", the hard-nosed, yet sympathetic heroine who helps Smith in his plight. You can see immediately when she falls in love with Smith in a wonderfully filmed scene where Smith promotes his ideals for the youth of America. The classical Hollywood close-up is utilized to show her love through happy tears.As in most Capra flicks, the supporting cast is colorful and right to create a slightly comedic and heavily dramatic atmosphere. You can only imagine how the U.S. government viewed this picture back in the day. Capra was a maverick who clearly put country and hope first on his list of artistic priorities. The happenings we see in a film like MR SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON can only happen in Hollywood films, which is why the system and its classics have endured for so long. Here is a movie that they should show in the \"Capital Dome\" on a daily basis to the fatcats who sit in office today. \"Jefferson Smith\" is pure fiction but absolutely possible if only earnestness and honesty were practiced in Washington now. Elements of this great film are all over movies like JFK, ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, or BORN ON THE 4TH OF JULY. To sound overly enthusiastic, take this movie and hold it up in front of you and take in its important message.RATING: 10 of 10"}, {"rank": 198, "name": "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington", "movie_year": "1939", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "\"Thirty years ago, I was you,\" says Senator Paine to the young, idealistic Jefferson Smith, \"but I learned to compromise.\"The film is Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, the story of a man who takes on the political system, refuses to compromise, and still wins. Unrealistic? Perhaps, but director Frank Capra takes an Oscar winning story by Lewis Foster, combines it with James Stewart's virtuous portrayal of innocent every man Jefferson Smith, and makes audiences once again believe that \"lost causes\" really are \"the causes worth fighting for.\"Yet in the cloakrooms of Washington this positive message was not embraced. The controversy surfaced in the October 5, 1939 edition of Variety featuring the front-page headline, \"Capra's 'Mr. Smith' Goes to Washington and Solons, Seemingly, Can't Take It.\"\"Infamous,\" \"treasonable,\" \"disgusting,\" and \"outrageous,\" were only a few of the sizzling adjectives used by lawmakers to describe the film.The uproar, according to Variety, stemmed from the \"too close to the average lawmaker\" depiction of 'Senator Paine,' a character who mentors freshman Senator Jefferson Smith only to turn on him. It was also reported that the film's virtue-will-triumph approach had no impact on irate congressmen who insisted that the picture reflected poorly on the dignity and integrity of the Senate.Incidentally, this added publicity, along with the film's strong reviews and word of mouth, resulted in bullish box office. Opening at Radio City Music Hall, Mr. Smith quickly became the biggest hit in town, earning $110,000 its first week. This was followed by big openings in Buffalo ($15,000 its first week), Cincinnati ($16,500), Detroit ($17,000) and Philadelphia ($22,000). It even pulled $15,000 in Cleveland the same weekend as a traffic- stopping Notre Dame-Navy football game attended by over 80,000 people.Today, as we near the 60-year anniversary of the film's release, it stands as an unlikely early target of vicious attacks by lawmakers who feared its impact on the minds of film patrons."}, {"rank": 198, "name": "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington", "movie_year": "1939", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Since the beginning of the art form, movies have generally fallen into two categories: the realistic, and the fantastic (fantasy-based). There are some that point out that the films of Frank Capra unduly fall into the latter, that they are completely far-fetched and fastened in their own time, and even invented a pejorative term \"Capra-esque\" to describe any non-cynical, heartwarming picture that has a message. His great films, like It Happened One Night, It's a Wonderful Life, and of course, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, however, are not fixed in a single era, but all eras, the truest definition of a classic. And considering it was released among true powerhouses in 1939, a year as important to movies as 1998 was to baseball, its ideals, story, and general excellence shine as bright today as it did over 60 years ago.A Senator from an unnamed, middle America state dies and a new one must be appointed by Governor Hubert Hopper, a puppet whose strings are held by newspaper magnate Jim Taylor. They need to find one that would be easily controlled by the now-senior Senator Joseph Paine (played brilliantly by Claude Rains), so a bill allowing a building of a dam near land by the Willett Creek owned by Taylor can pass in the Senate. After his initial choice is rejected by Taylor, and Taylor's handpicked man is shot down by the public, the governor chooses Jefferson Smith, played to perfection by James Stewart, a boy scout leader and local hero who is both wholly idealistic in his patriotism for America but naive and blind to the actual process. After he gets embarrassed by the local print media, Mr. Smith begins to learn the harsh realities of DC. Paine, Smith's boyhood hero, takes him under his wing and suggests that Smith try to create a bill. Smith agrees, and with his assistant, Clarissa Saunders (played by Jean Arthur), they create a bill to create a campground for boys from all over the country to learn about each other and the civic process, much to the initial dissuasion by Saunders. Smith then wants to choose a site near the Willett Creek, the same site where the dam is to be built and when his superiors and true string-pullers find that out, major complications ensue.Although the basic premise is David vs. Goliath, the story is wholly originally and was probably one of the earliest pictures to suggest the government as corrupt. The characters are played excellently by all principal actors, with Mr. Smith you root for whole-heartedly, Mr. Taylor you root against for his sheer arrogance and greed, and Mr. Paine, who you pity as you see a man who lost his initial zest to serve the public and is now a jaded shell of his former self. A great performance was given by Harry Carey, Sr., who plays the Vice President/President of the Senate for comic relief. The lines where completely believable and the parts of Smith's final filibuster that were shown give the most impact. There is a beautifully shot scene with images of the monuments and sights of Washington with several national anthems synchronized as the score. The climax is as tension-packed as drama can get, and while the ending may seem rather sudden, and everything isn't completely or neatly resolved, it works perfectly and ends the movie on a happy note.Obviously, few if any people elected to public office has the moral character, conviction, and general good heartedness of Jefferson Smith, and I doubt whether the government would be better if it was. The movie showed an ideal, a supposed \"lost cause\" of truth in government. And although it is next to impossible for Capra and the eternal good guy Jimmy Stewart to ever fully change the world of politics with just a motion picture, at least it shows that maybe once in a great while, being the good guy has its definite rewards. If (using the same analogy of the 1998 baseball season) The Wizard of Oz and Gone With the Wind were the Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa of 1939 moviemaking, then this would be like Cal Ripken voluntarily ending his Iron Man Streak, something done with full class and the highest respect in mind, and that elevates an ideal of being the good guy and sticking to your dedication brings the greatest of riches. This picture is flawless in all respects and a true classic, with thought-provoking ideas, wit, a little bit of platonic romance, and an excellent cinematography and score, and deserves the rank as a 10 out of 10.

This film has all of the elements that make a great film and still holds a slight bit of romance in the plot to keep the film exciting. If Capra ever intended to make a film based on Americana this one would surely fit the mould. Constant images of the historical landmarks that make Washington what it is are reminders of the greatness of this nation and the freedom that holds it together.The plot idea of corruption in the U.S. Senate may have been the first of its kind. Jimmy Stewart plays the small-town politician who is chosen to replace a recently-deceased Senator. He is chosen because the powers that be believe that he will vote the way they want him to and not raise a fuss when asked to. However, when Stewart decides on an initiative that contradicts the plans that the higher-ups have, they raise a scandal that nearly destroys him, his beliefs in what America stands for and provides us with one of the greatest performances ever caught on film.Capra's direction is flawless, capturing the feel of tradition in Washington and producing the best acting from Stewart, Jean Arthur and Claude Rains. The manner in which we see the protagonist bent but not broken has been duplicated by so many other filmmakers, but never really done quite as well. The performances by Allen and Rains each added great scenes to this film, especially in the last hour when the good vs. evil battle is at its peak.

Take for example the \"rip it out\" incident near the start. No English Literature book would have that kind of an introduction, so when Robin starts going on about the true meaning of poetry appreciation etc., it comes out sounding amazing; but in fact what he is saying is pretty mundane and only unorthodox when compared to the gothic horror of the School's teaching methods.As for the ending, most unlikely and frankly it even trivialises what is a serious subject.Seize the day - go do something else but don't bother with this!!"}, {"rank": 203, "name": "Dead Poets Society", "movie_year": "1989", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "but not John Keating.

Directors often get wrapped up in elaborate technology, but forget that plot is the driving mechanism in all film and literature. I relate this film in some ways to another great Robin Williams movie, \"Good Will Hunting.\" Both movies show that audiences still can be touched with intelligent and marked references to classic literature, and the themes contained in the work of anyone from Shakespeare to Cummings can be transferred to a modern audience. Although I am off the point of this movie in among itself, my point on a larger scale is that Hollywood needs more pointed, smart, touching films. I would rather indulge in a repeat viewing of a movie like \"Dead Poets\" as opposed to seeing what \"new spin\" has been added to the dead romantic comedy category.

He's willing to try absolutely anything to reach his students, and he does. As I watched Keating work his magic, I was reminded of all my greatest teachers, and it is obvious that Keating is largely taken from real life. Writer Tom Schulman only made up part of him, because there really are teachers as powerful and as daring as him. I've had many of them.There are also the students played by Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke, and others. They are accustomed to book teachers, those who move through a text simply for the sake of doing it, with little or no concern for whether the students grasp any of it or not. Then they meet Keating, with his suggestions for changing our points of view, and his cries of \"Carpe Diem!\" Of course they change. They really have very little choice in the matter.I refuse to spoil the ending.

He's like that here, too. So what's the difference?It's fourfold:(1) Peter Weir is far from being my favourite director - he's capable of pretentious turkeys like \"Picnic at Hanging Rock\", for one thing - but he's not a hack. Weir makes it worth watching in a number of ways other than those mentioned below.(2) If you see through the Cult of Williams and notice things which escape its adherents (Keating really IS a poor English teacher; the chapter he urges his students to tear out of their books is saying perfectly sensible things and at any rate, it's a strange thing to tell them to do under the guise of getting them to \"think for themselves\"; the hero-worship the students indulge in IS disturbing and unhealthy), it doesn't matter. The central story concerns the student Neil and how he acquires moral courage. It works as a story whatever attitude we take or ought to take towards Mr. Keating.

Robin Williams has true counterweights.(4) Robin Williams does not sweep all before him in a wave of triumph. What triumph there is muted and limited in scope.

Robin Williams did a fantastic performance as Mr. Keating, a teacher at a boarding school who gives inspiration to his classmates to have a mind of their own and to love poetry and other forms of creativity. The kids in his class think he's more than a teacher, and as the movie goes on it shows how the kids need his help with their own problems, and how Keating has a problem of his own that is a major tragedy to the kids. The kids also discover that he was part of a group called the Dead Poets Society where they sneaked out of the High School Boarding School and go to a cave where they read poetry to each other and let it drip from their tongues, like honey. The kids decide to start the group up again themselves, so they go out to the cave, where they read poetry. That's when one of the kids does a very stupid thing which gives away their secret to the school. Not only does this effect their lives, but Mr. Keating's as well.

The whole movie fits so well together with all the different stories in it, I have to respect director Peter Weir A LOT!

Its narrative, as I view it, is characterised by the move from bad to worse. It offers considerable psychological insight into how easily students, in a very strictly ordered environment that gives them very little freedom, can fall pray to a kind of sectarian leader who demands that they worship him as their 'captain' and lose the sense of reality.Two very different faces of totalitarianism are contrasted in a very interesting way. In principle, it should not matter that much that this is probably not what was intended.Dostoyevski, for instance, was a staunch conservative who propounded a conservative nationalist and religious ideology, which did not prevent him from writing novels that show an astonishing variety of ideological and philosophical topoi. Therefore, it should not matter that much that, as it seems, the totalitarian action of the teacher was probably intended as a positive contrast to the strict order that is there at the college. But, in my view, in this case, the ideological purpose nevertheless affects the quality of this film. It is good for provoking thought about sectarian totalitarianism, but that's all. The pervasiveness of the ideological purpose dominates the whole story so much that most of the interesting qualities of the situation get lost.I would say that this is a most typically American film, in the slightly derogatory sense this word often has to Europeans when used in cultural issues: It is dominated by ideas, such as freedom, but the words remain empty, devoid of liveliness, and there is not the slightest hint of the idea that flight from authoritarian order could mean something else than following a sectarian leader. I do not object to depicting such bleakness in movies, and it must probably be regarded as an achievement of this film that it can produce such repulsion in people who are not familiar with this kind of authoritarian society, but the bleakness is disguised in such a nice and kitschy American stereotypes, such as striving for freedom, that I find it just bad taste."}, {"rank": 203, "name": "Dead Poets Society", "movie_year": "1989", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Peter Weir gives Robin Williams a shot at a character that he has played many times since.

Also, I don't think I have ever been so touched by a single scene in a movie like I was with the final scene in this movie. When you could see the guilt in the eyes of the Ethan Hawke character, knowing that he was partially responsible for Mr. Keating's dismissal. You could tell he just wanted to tell Mr Keating how much he meant to all of his friends and him. And you could also see the forgivness in the eyes of Robin Williams, knowing that the boys were not to blame, but rather the \"establishment\". And when Mr. Keating was just about to leave the classroom for the last time, and Ethan Hawke jumped up on his desk and addressed Mr Keating \"Captain, My Captain!\"... I literally wept out loud. I have never cried during a movie like I did with this one. I literally bawled that entire scene (when the students stood up on their desks), and didn't stop until half-way through the final credits.

First and foremost, the teacher needs to be a mentor. He or she must inspire and lead the scholars in their (often times reluctant) search of truths. The teacher's style must be different and unique. I have seen too many great minds wasted in the public school system after teaching years and years of the same exact curriculum. Finally, the teacher must be a friend and connect with his or her pupils on a level that will truly open their eyes and help them connect better with their world. Not just with the literature, or the poetry, or the theatre, but also with their own thoughts and their own beliefs. Robin Williams does a magnificent job giving us this message, and I am still struggling over whether or not to show this movie in my future classes.

Being an 18-year-old film fanatic from America, and trying to rent the best imported movies from the local video store isn't as easy as I wished it would be. Not that foreign titles are hard to find, but you aren't always in the mood to read subtitles through-out a film, no matter how great it is (and I despise dubbing).Ingmar Bergman's THE SEVENTH SEAL, a sweeping journey into the last days of Max von Sydow's crusader's life as he tries to find many answers before he is taken away by Death (Bengt Ekerot, in a magnificent performance). Among these questions is the reason behind God's rapidly migrating Black Plague throughout the country. Is it a punishment to the mortals, a comeuppance? von Sydow tries to prolong his life in the film's wittiest scene, by playing a game of chess with Death.The medieval landscape is a very romantic quality to this drama, though the dreaded undertones of seriousness keep your feet to the ground. You are always aware that death is around the corner, that the Plague is a serious issue, that people are looking into the skies for answers from a Creator who has supposedly cursed them.The film is shot entirely in black and white, which adds a little whimsy into the tale. Especially in the scenes of the beach (it is always interesting and surreal watching a knight admire waves which the viewer familiarizes with surfers and beach bunnies).

Where did that image come from or originate? Well, here it is! I'll always remember the image of death, because it is something, or in the case of this film, a figure that we will all one day, face at some point in our lives. And it's really beautifully expressed, because although death can be very frightening the first time we see it, we realize that there is nothing to fear, and that life is something that is very precious and beautiful, once you learn to enjoy it. This film is not so much about death as it is about life. Life is a gift, and I don't think people should waste it. If you waste it, when death confronts you for the first time in your life, you will feel regret and wish you could go back and make the most of your life. Unfortunately, that's not going to happen. But fortunately, those left alive still have a chance to make the best of what life they have left to live. The image of the people dancing with death at the conclusion of the film, shows how little we have to fear and that those who are dead are in a better place than they might have been. Both life and death are places that people are going to go in their lives, yet they will not be unhappy or scared once they get there. That is the real beauty of this film. There's no avoiding it, but there is nothing to be afraid of. Life is a wonderful, beautiful gift that we will one day lose to death, as does the man who loses the chess game with death. And the game of chess with death clearly shows that there is no other way of conquering death, other than dying. \"The Seventh Seal\" stands out as a powerful message for people, as well as a majestic piece of artwork that can never be repeated or duplicated in other films as finely or as masterfully as this!"}, {"rank": 205, "name": "The Seventh Seal", "movie_year": "1957", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "In my opinion, this is the best film ever made.

Its musical score is arguably the most memorable in movie history. And qualified kudos can even be given for its special effects.Nevertheless, the very best thing about Jaws is its character interaction.It is with a certain amount of chagrin that I must admit to having watched this movie literally several dozen times, but I should probably mention that the vast majority of those times were confined to watching the last half of the film--the ocean-going scenes with Brody, Hooper, and Quint that my friends and I affectionately refer to as \"The Boat Scene.\" In my view, the beauty of Jaws is that the special effects of this film are easily overshadowed by the actors and their dialogue. It is difficult indeed (perhaps impossible) to think of another F/X-based movie where this is the case.So strong are the dialogue and character interaction of the final half of Jaws, that they rescue the film from a number of plot devices ranging from implausible (e.g., a 35' foot shark engaged in a high-speed boat chase) to the sublimely ridiculous (e.g., a 35' foot shark leaping atop a boat to capsize it). In my view, the F/X shark is literally a secondary consideration in this film. Sure, you couldn't have a shark film without it, but the shark alone cannot a good (or even passable) film make . . . as is amply demonstrated by the abysmal Jaws 3D and Jaws the Revenge, as well as by the truly mediocre Jaws II.It is perhaps worth admitting that the dialogue of the \"Boat Scene\" is not the only great character interaction in the film--it is simply the best. The acting in Jaws is generally pretty good, but nothing beats the \"Boat Scene\" and the actors who comprise it. Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss are so good in this film that they clearly elevate Roy Scheider's performance.

I could almost smell the sea-salt in the room. Its no surprise that this film scared half of New York city witless in the summer of '75, its such a thrill.Jaws was really the first summer blockbuster, kicking off a trend that is still present today. A film that reminds us of the terrors of the unknown, the fear of an untamed, unleashed primeval force, capable of destroying a whole community. Amity will surely never recover (not for three sequels anyway) from the arrival of a twenty-five foot rubber shark. The fact that the shark itself is so fake looking is immaterial, the abscence of large fish merely heightens the terrible suspense felt.The performances from the three male leads is exemplary, Scheider, as the hard-bitten New York cop no longer used to dealing with such hysteria that envelopes his peaceful coastal resort,plays Martin Brody close to his chest, calm and regulated until his fear of the sea (and a big fish) overpowers him and he loses it aboard the Orca.Dreyfuss brings the essential touch of humour to the proceedings, and I doubt that without his smart observations and comical mimicry of Quint that the movie would have been so successful with the younger audience, who would have seen only a shark eating people. And Robert Shaw as Quint, salty sea-dog supreme, a master fisherman, confident in his ability to land the great white.

It's not only the story that grabs us and has us asking for more, but it's also the characters. Characters in movies like this are usually cardboard-like and one-dimensional because it's an action/suspense/horror flick and the good actors and clever characters are in more serious dramas that usually take home the Oscar for Best Actor/Actress/Picture etc. That isn't the case with \"Jaws\". This movie has fantastic acting and interesting characters unlike any ever seen in a movie before or since. The best character in the film and probably one of the best ever is Quint, the mean shark hunter. Quint is played by Robert Shaw, a fine actor who has been in a lot of great movies such as \"The Sting\" and \"The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three\". His performance in \"Jaws\" is his greatest achievement. Everything he does from his opening scene (grabbing the city council's attention by scraping his fingers down a blackboard) to his final death scene is wonderful. I can't think of a more enjoyable character to watch in a movie. Even when Quint isn't speaking, his character is through expression. Loud and opinionated, brutal yet poetic....Quint shows us a human being obsessed with a mission and conflicted with events of the past and the modern world around him. It is a character that once existed, but few have ever encountered. Quint's sea songs fill us with pride and spirit: (\"Farewell and Adieu To You Fair Spanish Ladies....\")Quint's vulgar ocean poems (The poem about 103 year old Mary Lee) give us a feeling of comfort. Quint's brilliant orders that were planned carefully and strategically: (\"Hooper!! Starbird!\" \"Hooper!! Full Throttle!\") Quint's magnificent observations, (\"You got city hands Mr. Hooper, been counting money all your life.\") show us that he is a wise man who has been all over the world and can tell a man's profession simply by glancing at his hands. Up to this point, people think that Quint is just a loud and mean old sea salt with no compassion or character structure. They're all wrong once they see the scene where Quint calmly and quietly tells the story of how he was exposed to sharks during World War 2. It gives Quint character and Spielberg lets Quint take his time in telling the story aboard the \"Orca\" - the vessel the 3 men go on to kill the shark. By giving him time to tell the story, you are allowing him to create his character and allow the viewer to put two and two together. Now you know why Quint is like that. How ironic is it when Quint's past comes back to haunt him in his final scene?

The thing that scares the most is not the sight of something horrible or frightening but merely the thought. People who prefer books to films often say that books require much more imagination. Well what else is at work in the early scenes of Jaws, where you don't see the shark at all, but your imagination. Arguably the most chilling scene is the opening one when the girl gets savagely ripped apart. The only indication of a shark is the fact that nothing else could throw around a person like that but a great white.The weakest scenes, in my opinion, are near the end when the shark actively attacks the boat and we see far too much of what is a pretty average model. If Speilberg had the backing and money he had now he would have made an entirely different film and I would say an inferior one to this classic.Much of the plot and story comes from the fact that the shark cannot be seen and is being hunted down. How many great scenes would have been lost if it became a gore fest or an action adventure like so many of today's pathetic offerings ?Maybe I am not giving Speilberg enough credit. He is a great film maker and would have seen the benefit of suspense to his movie rather than outright graphic horror. It is the idea that a shark that big could be out there that put many people off swimming in the sea for a long time.\nAs we saw in the sequels even the same formula, handled in the wrong way, didn't work. Forget the sequels, Jaws is probably the best true thriller ever made made by one of the top directors and starring a perfect cast.

And what I remember most about it, is thinking that I had found the most frightening film that I had ever seen. When I asked my parents if there really was a Jaws and they reassured me there wasn't, I still thought they were lying ( and they were, he does exist, I'm sure of it ). To this day, almost 20 years later, I am still frightened to go swimming. I have been to the Caribbean twice in my life. Once to the Bahamas with my high school graduating class and once to Acapulco for March Break. Neither time did my classmates or friends venture into the water because of me. \" Did yo know that most shark attacks happen in three feet of water of less? \" I asked them. Needless to say the hotel pool was well utilized on both trips.Jaws is perfect on every level of film making. It has incredibly well developed characters, so well that we feel their fears and their bravado when we are supposed to. The direction is some of the best I have ever seen. We are but marionettes in Spielberg's fingers. When he wants us to feel, he pulls our strings and masterfully we feel scared or horrified or even amused. A perfect example of this is the killing of the Kinter kid, the second death of the movie.The scene starts off shortly after Chrissie Watkins is killed. There are people playing on the beach and in the water. Brody ( the police chief ) is sitting tentatively watching things intently. He hears screams from a young girl. But of course they are playful screams. Then we see a man playing fetch the stick with his dog. Finally we meet Alex Kinter. He goes out on his raft into the water. Then we see the shots from under water. It's as if something is approaching. We're really not sure if we are being teased here or not. But then we see a stick floating in the water and the man calling out for his dog. But he is not there. Then we see more kids splashing and then we cut to a shot approaching the Kinter boy on his raft from under water. And the music. And then...... well, we all know what happens. Now that is a director masterfully manipulating us.Jaws stands up to and surpasses any film these days that is considered brilliant and it surpasses anything that came before it.

After 1975, mainstream movies were no longer for adults, but are instead geared to teenagers, or perhaps to the child within us. People go to the movies to see fancy special effects and get cheap thrills, not necessarily to explore interesting characters and stories.That being said, the movie that started it all is still enjoyable on its own terms, particularly the second half, when it becomes a Moby Dick story of three men on a boat chasing and being chased by a big fish.

He would become the hero of the film and the sequel.And the real star of the film was the shark who was named \"bruce\" after Steven Spielbergs lawyer.

Peter Benchley's tawdry gutter fiction is hugely improved upon by Carl Gottlieb's screenplay. With Spielberg's taut direction, Williams iconic score, terse editing, lovely anamorphic Panavision photography, and wonderful chemistry between the three leads also to its advantage Benchley's novel thankfully becomes a distant memory.Before Spielberg became the biggest name in Hollywood, capable of green-lighting anything he wants, he wandered in Richard Zanuck's office and picked up the script thinking he could churn out a decent B-movie. His only theatrical movie before this was The Sugarland Express, though it wasn't a huge hit. Jaws became the first summer blockbuster when crowds literally lined-up around the block to see it. $470 million dollars worth of bust is enough to kick-start any career.In the Atlantic waters off the coast of Amity Island a 25-foot Great White Shark has staked a claim for his hunting ground. The bathers and holiday makers are all he needs for his breakfast, lunch, and dinner. New police chief Martin Brody wants to close the beaches but the greed of local business owners keeps the meaty flesh of human on the sand and beneath the sun.When a young boy is devoured his mother offers a $3K reward for the killing of the shark, causing the overzealous, money-hungry local fishermen to crowd the waters with dynamite and chum. Only Quint (the one and only Robert Shaw), a WWII veteran with a personal vendetta against shark-kind, has the skill to pursue the monster. Brody and oceanographer Matt Hooper (a 'young' Richard Dreyfuss) join Quint on his hunt not knowing how monstrous the shark really is.Jaws is split into two perfect halves. One landlocked, filled with fences, boundaries, and a sense of being contained. The other filled with isolation and a sense of not belonging. The Orca, Quint's ramshackle boat, becomes its own little island, ever so slowly disintegrating and sinking as their safety slips away. Brody, already afraid of the water, almost buckles under the pressure, Hooper loses his cool when no one trusts his judgment, and Quint loses his sanity as he aggressively, psychotically pursues the shark.What makes Jaws special is that it scars and stays with you. The only other movie that I can of that has had similar success is the 1999 horror The Blair Witch Project. In much the same way as Jaws kept millions of people out of the water, Blair Witch kept them out of the woods too. There are some places that humans are just not supposed to go.

Since then my obsessive nature with anything to do with sharks has died down, but I still love Spielberg and his work. This film started the whole summer blockbuster and along with it started the whole hook thing where the first few minutes of a film leave you hooked and wanting to see more. Those first few minutes had me on the edge of my seat with my heart pounding. I later found out it was so convincing, because Susan Backlinie who played the helpless victim Chrissie was being yanked too hard on her feet by the divers underneath and those were real grimaces of pain. Roy Schneider, Richard Dreyfuss and Robert Shaw make a perfect trio and the film really starts to focus on these 3 characters and really starts to get thrilling as they leave land to kill the dreaded 25-footer. What follows is a fascinating portrayal of the 3 different ways these men handle what is before them. Roy Schneider's classic line 'You're gonna need a bigger boat' has been ripped off time and time again most recently with Godzilla 'We're gonna neeed bigger guns' A classic chilling film masterpiece from beginning to end.

But one summer, the summer of '75 a new visitor comes to the bech an enormous man-eating great white shark. Brody (ROY SCHEIDER) a former big city cop and now the local sheriff, finds the remains of a college girl and orders the beaches closed. Mayor Vaughan (MURRAY HAMILTON) and other city officials, however, rescind that order for fear of what it will do to the town's tourism. Brody and his wife Ellen (LORRAINE GARY) don't think that was the right thing to do and worry about the safety of their two boys. After several more people are killed by the shark, though, Brody closes the beaches and brings in Hooper (RICHARD DREYFUSS), an oceanographic expert, to help find the shark. In the end, however, they need Quint (ROBERT SHAW), the local, grizzled \"old man of the sea\" to hunt down and kill the shark. The three men then head out into open waters and bait, and wait, for their encounter with the dangerous shark. One of the great box-office hits of all time is also one of the best horror films in the last few decades. Spielberg's classic shark story, based on Peter Benchley's novel, kept millions out of the water during the summer of '75. Roy Scheider, Richard Dreyfuss and the great Robert Shaw go shark hunting off the New England coast and find Melvillian adventure. A classic combination of suspense, effects, editing, cinematography, score and bristling characterizations. The movie that was supposed to be 1975's biggest flop, but instead it has become a classic thriller.

I'm not talking about the Hollywood blockbuster, or the insane madness that sent thousands of misunderstood Great Whites to their deaths, I'm talking about the beginning of my interest in movies. This is the movie that did it. I couldn't tell you how old I was when I first saw it, but I do remember this is the movie I made my parents rent time and time again when we went to the video store. This is the movie that drove my parents and some of my friends nuts while I watched it day after day after day when my mom gave it to me for Christmas. This is the movie that made me want to turn a real interest in the movies from just a hobby and into a career. For that, I owe Spielberg, Benchley, Scheider, Shaw, Dreyfuss, Williams, Fields and everyone else a sincere and heart-felt thank you. I own this movie on every format in which it is available. I love it that much. I've probably seen it between 200 and 300 times. I guess you can say it is an obsession. A sick obsession. The plot, the pacing, the editing, the score, the acting, and, oh yes, the shark. Who cares that is fake? By the time we finally get to see it, do we care? Truly, a more suspenseful movie was never made. Several come close, but none quite reaches the primal level the JAWS does. No other film so effectively taps into our fear of the unknown, and then gives it a riveting score to boot. No other movie grips us so strongly with heart stopping suspense that we find ourselves nearly falling off our seats. And no other movie leaves us feeling so spent and wasted after a viewing. And the reason for all the fear, suspense and emotional withdrawal is not top-notch special effects. It was the mid-70's. You can barely apply top -notch to anything of that era. The reason the movie does all that to us is that it is a great story. It is filled with real people, who have real jobs, and who have real fears. And who must now confront a real shark. Can you think of anything more terrifying that getting on a rickety, leaky boat to kill a 25-foot shark when you already have a paralyzing fear of the water? I can't. And Martin Brody sure can't. And so, no matter what ranking JAWS may get on AFI's list of the 100 greatest movies, or TV Guides list of the top 50 movies, or any list for that matter, JAWS will always come in number one on mine. Steven, Peter, Roy, Robert, Richard, John, and Verna -- thank you. Not for just giving me a sense of direction in my life, not for just making me want to be a screenwriter, but also for making a movie that still thrills me as much now when I watch it as when it did when I saw it for the very first time."}, {"rank": 206, "name": "Jaws", "movie_year": "1975", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Jaws was the first modern-day blockbuster.

This rich, multi-layered comedy just seems to get better with each additional viewing--perhaps because no matter how hard you puzzle over the film, you'll never quite be able to understand everything about it at once. I equate The Big Lebowski to 12 Monkeys in that regard--both films are wildly entertaining on the surface, slightly ominous underneath, and have moments of pure genius throughout.Each of the Coens' films seems to be their take on a certain part of the country, in particular criminal activity gone awry in each area--with numerous references to their favorite movies thrown in. The Big Lebowski seems to take L.A. head-on and show us the city as something \"every bit as stupefying as in any of those other places\". If Fargo and The Big Sleep are combined with modern L.A., The Big Lebowski would be the result. \nJeff Bridges and John Goodman seem to be perfectly cast because their back-and-forth banter is hilarious. I actually can't think of a character that I would have cast differently--every character is memorable and thoroughly entertaining in its own way. The way they play off one another and affect the Dude's travels is just crazy. There is some really great writing in this film and the soundtrack is really great (especially the dream sequences). If you only watch the movie once, you're probably missing a lot of things.I tend to like movies that break \"conventions\", and this is definitely one of those films. The main characters aren't glamorous at all, the film's only sex scene is hilarious in contrast to the typical hollywood scene, and there isn't a coherent plot that can be outlined in a nice simple layout that everybody will understand. Just like the main characters, the film seems to bumble around aimlessly--but all the bumbling somehow resonates with coherence by the time it's all over.You'll either love this movie or hate it. If you're offended by drug use (even though the film hardly glamorizes the use of drugs--it shows what happens to the \"Dude\" after years of drug abuse... he's an unemployed former Roadie for Metallica...) or profanity (I think this movie probably set the record for the use of the F-word--but it's always sort of melded into the conversation and you hardly even notice it after a while) this may not be the film for you.

Let me give you an example of why TBL is so good, and better than Fargo. Jesus Quintana. Jesus will probably be the best character to ever appear in a movie. The Coen's created an urban legend with Jesus, and then only gave him a few minutes of screen time. This is actually a good thing, however, since having him in the movie too much would ruin him in the same manner knowing the ending to the Usual Suspects would ruin the experience. Those who love Jesus as much as I do can only live with the fact that we'll never see him in a film ever again. But using him in another film would ruin the character. So this also is a good thing. The Coen's did it right with Jesus, a unique character that creates a unique comical experience in a unique film.

They talked of it lasting hundreds of episodes, when in fact, there were only a handful of episodes. There were jokes about every day life. Jokes about the simple fact that the Dude is a dinosaur. Every other \"radical\" or \"hippie\" grew up, got jobs, and stopped with the drugs. The Dude on the other hand, is still living in the 60s. And if you look at his friends they all have their own little stories, and show how deeply their pasts affect them. However, they show this great characterization through jokes. Something very hard to do. For example Walter(Goodman)obviously hit his peak and the height of his life, back in Vietnam and when he was married. So, the jokes about him are Walter spazzing at people \"I AM A UNITED STATES VETERAN!\" And that's how we get to know him. How unique is that? The same thing can be said of Donnie(Buscemi) here is an ex-surfer who obviously did drugs, and they took his mind, you know this from his sheer absent mindedness. It's truly a unique film, of which we shall never see the like again, and for that I'm sorry. It's the Coen brothers at top form."}, {"rank": 208, "name": "The Big Lebowski", "movie_year": "1998", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "One of the greatest films EVER made!

The general concensus was that \"Withnail & I\" had that title of funniest, and of that there was little genuine argument. However, there was a small contingent of persons present who claimed that the Coen brothers with Lebowski, a then, recent offering, could possibly wrest the title from Robinson's hitherto safe hands. Though I should add that they voiced this opinion in a humble and respectful manner.An investigation ensued, and within a week I had located an establishment that was to play it, and set to my task, viz. a comparison with studious meticulousisity. To take the film as it stands would be the only way to treat it fairly because, to be fair to it, it is completely different to Withnail. It is a totally different kind of humour, and style of filming. Whereas Withnail features a kind of low budget dark, earthy and realistic humour, Lebowski has a certain elaborate feel to it, from the expensive sets and abstract scenes to the wealth of locations and Hollywood feel. But enough of the comparisons, I'm supposed to be writing about Lebowski here, so no more Withnail. But let it be said, they are both titled on names and concentrate on bums (or a bum).Lebowski tends to rely on seemingly obvious jokes and repeated lines and styles,(such as \"shut the F***K UP Donny\", \"I'll suck your c**k for a thousand dollars\" and \"Am I wrong?\") combined with a rewarding subtle blend of character-based humour, (such as Lebowski never finishing his lines, Donny never getting to say anything, Brandt's nervous mannerisms, and numerous self referential statements). Some people from the Dumb and Dumber school of comedy appreciation will \"get\" very little of Lebowski, and will not rate it. These are largely the same kind of people who thought that Mallrats was better than Clerks. The introduction to the film and, most importantly, to Lebowski is utterly perfect. The look at this supposed bum, and then at the till girl to put things in perspective, creates good empathy with the inner workings of the protagonist. He took his choice, others take theirs. Great camera work and combination with Dylan provides the perfect setting to the bowling hall, and hence, the backdrop to the film. This style of filming is the Coen brothers at their very best, and blending of the title sequence into the story is done as well as anyone could do.This film is made of a combination of straightforward camera shots and dialogue with very little action (aside from bowling or driving). This is then juxtaposed with some very abstract scenes such as dream sequences and slow motion footage of (questionably) real situations. This technique often creates a very effective result though sometimes can become tiresome. The main crux of the film is set in the real world and revolves around The Dude attempting to repatriate his living room with a rug. This is largely done in a very ordinary fashion but with a great wealth of humorous conversation. Goodman provides many memorable sayings. Where the film goes at a tangent to this, but with immediate purpose in mind, it works very well. The best examples of this are the introductory bowling scene (as stated), and the introduction of the loveable Jesus. When these scenes are not so welcome is when they actively distract from the flow of the story and serve only to break it up in an undesirable manner. Still, without this experimentation we would have been without some of the film's most impressive moments.As The Dude's main opponent is The Big Lebowski, a disabled veteran with a personal achievement complex. He is acted out brilliantly by Huddleston, has an excellent vocabulary ( including micturate) and is a very aggressive character, especially towards The Dude. Looking after him is his faithful servant Brandt who has some delightful nervous mannerisms and peculiar gaits which work well with his characters speaking parts. The blend of humour is mostly based around slight subtlety on the part of some characters, and outright over-the-top acting on the part of others. Add this to some great visuals, though not over the top, and the result is a finely crafted humorous product. In all, though not as good as the all conquering Withnail, Lebowski does manage to better Fargo, and is certainly one of the funniest films in recent years."}, {"rank": 208, "name": "The Big Lebowski", "movie_year": "1998", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "To point out the less obvious, John Goodman has already played a nutcase character in other Coen Brothers movies: \"Raising Arizona\" (As the prison escapee) and \"Barton Fink\" (as the arson-murderer). In this, he plays a disgruntled Vietnam veteran. And Steve Buscemi, for the hundredth time, plays a pedophile. It's starting to look a little tacky and routine. Maybe, now that the Coens received Academy Awards for \"Fargo\" they should reconsider to hire other actors?Well, I marginally recommend this film. It seemed like another version of Fargo (kidnapping, ransom) only this was stranger and Fargo was much better. There's really little to recommend about in this movie, but it was one of the better films to be released in the early '98 year. Worth seeing once."}, {"rank": 208, "name": "The Big Lebowski", "movie_year": "1998", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "The Coen brothers (Joel and Ethan) are the most innovative and, perhaps, the best filmmakers working today. Or they at least rank along side the likes of Martin Scorsese and rising director star Quentin Tarantino. Think about it: \"Blood Simple\" was the best film of 1984; \"Raising Arizona\" was the best film of 1987; \"Miller's Crossing\" was the best movie of 1990; \"Barton Fink\" was the best movie of 1991; and \"Fargo\" was the best movie of 1996. Now comes their latest effort, \"The Big Lebowski,\" which, while it isn't in quite the same league as the above films, is still one of the most thoroughly entertaining movies of 1998.It tells the shambling story of a man named Jeff Lebowski, who calls himself The Dude (Jeff Bridges). The Dude's apartment gets broken into and a thief urinates on his rug. He finds out that the criminals were not looking for him, but looking for the OTHER Jeff Lebowski, the disabled millionaire (played by David Huddleston). That's all I can tell you. The rest is really too bizarre and complicated to put into words; but it's bizarre and complicated in the best ways of the words.Still, what I'll remember most about \"The Big Lebowski\" is the outstanding number of utterly terrific performances. Bridges delivers the best performance of his career and probably the best of the year as a bum lie-about who just wants to be left alone. John Goodman is the real comic gem here as the forever-loudmouthed Walter, The Dude's bowling partner and best friend. Steve Buscemi co-stars as the dimwitted, bug-eyed Donny, the third bowling partner; there's a small but interestingly offbeat spot for Julianne Moore; and John Torturro stops in, as Jesus the bowler, for what is probably the best walk-on performance in years. If you are a Coen brothers fan or like humor that is distinctly offbeat, you have found your movie.

I appreciate the effort to do something completely \"out there,\" but there were two points when I expected an explosion of Coen cinema, and they never happened.When the Dude discovers he is being followed (by Jon Polito from Miller's Crossing and Barton Fink, no less)), I expected a classic Coen sequence -- a car chase of some sort, but not just a car chase, if you know the Coens.The other glaring omission was the bowling match at the end. As they displayed in the dream sequence -- which was an MTVish disappointment, but still stylish -- the Coens can photograph anything and make it interesting. We sat through enough rambling -- we deserved that bowling match. Is it possible some studio editor decided it wasn't necessary?Jeff Bridges is brilliant as the Dude. It is not an exaggeration to say that he deserved as Oscar nomination.Bridges's performance is so realistic and convincing that John Goodman, who's normally great, comes across as gimmicky and schticky. And I didn't think it was possible to waste Steve Buscemi -- because he's great even when he just stands around -- but he is wasted here.Rent Miller's Crossing instead.

They're not all bitesize, easy to swallow, lightweight moneyspinners. And they don't have to be dark, sombre dramas either. They can be fun, bouncy, hilarious comedies as well. With this film the Coen's prove their mastery of film to the world. The heavy style of Blood Simple and Barton Fink has been replaced by a palpable cool and and a nature so easy going you almost don't feel it. The writing is wonderful and the scenes hilarious. The Dudes dream sequences will have you in stitches while the marmot-in-a-bathtub routine will have the male audience crossing their legs ferociously.This film is driven by the characters so it's good to see that they're as well written as they are acted. The Dude is so laid back he's almost horizontal and every line is spoken with such a super calm, take it easy style that it's impossible not to love him as soon as you see him. All he wants is his rug back and rather than suddenly solving the baffling mystery he merely wanders around the edges waiting for his treasured Persian to arrive. It's a wonderfully warm and human character, effortlessly played by Bridges. The same can be said of Walter, Donny and Maude. Each are so lifelike that you want to reach up and touch them. But the show is stolen by (or rather handed over to) John Turturro as Jesus Quintana. See this guy and laugh till you burst.All in all a comedy for the Simpsons generation.

The camera was manipulated beautifully and I felt a tinge of their talents lurking in at many a turn. The performances are astounding, especially Goodman as the deranged bowler still living deep within the jungles of the Vietcong. Huddleston is also quite wonderful as the title character. Turturro gives a fine cameo as \"Jesus,\" coupled with a rousing and humurous version of the Eagles, \"Hotel California,\" done in Espanol.

The duo are absolutely hilarious together and seem to play flawlessly off of each other throughout the film. Steve Buscemi plays a short but funny role as the spaced out friend of the Dude and John Turturro may have well stole the show playing the over-indulgent exposer/bowler Jesus.This film contains some of the most hilarious and wacky scenes that I have seen in a long time. These include: the scene in which thugs bust into the Dude's lair and dunk his head in his toilet and then proceed to urinate all over his rug, the scene in which the Dude writes a check for 69 cents, the scene in which the Germans bust into the Dude's lair and put a Marmot into the tub with him while he is having a bath and the fight scene between the Germans and the Dude, Walter and Buscemi's character.This film worked for me in every aspect except for the lack of a plot to guide the film and the overlong ending.

Set in Los Angeles (circa 1991 at the height of the Persian Gulf War), this effort from the inventive duo is a whimsical tale about a man known as The Dude.Jeff `The Dude' Lebowski (Jeff Bridges) is a laid-back kinda guy, an aging Hippie who spends his days drinking White Russians, smoking pot, and bowling with his buddies. One day, this all changes when two thugs invade his home, rough him up, and urinate on his rug. It seems that they have The Dude confused with another Lebowski, a rich millionaire whose young wife owes money all over town.Bummed at having his prized rug ruined, The Dude decides to contact the other Lebowski and in doing so becomes immersed in a very strange, convoluted plot that involves nihilists, a kidnapping, Busby Berkley dream sequences, British performance artists, and bowling.Sound a little strange? It's all par for the course with the Coen brothers, a clever filmmaking duo that loves tweaking existing genres to the point that they become something very different and distinctly Coenesque.This includes fully-realized characters, both major and minor, that have their own unique habits and mannerisms. Most films do not take the time to flesh out their respective worlds or the characters that live in them but this is not the case with the Coens.The Big Lebowski presents a world rich in detail and atmosphere and is subsequently populated by often a humourous and sometimes bizarre collection of characters that range from an obnoxiously narcissistic bowler named Jesus (John Turturro) to Walter Sobchak (John Goodman), The Dude's loyal bowling buddy who just happens to be a Vietnam vet with a short fuse.The cast do a great job in supporting the main character, played wonderfully by Jeff Bridges. He creates mannerisms and habits that flesh out his character perfectly. From the first time we see him, Bridges is The Dude. And even though he is a down-and-out loser, there is something undeniably likable about him, and this is due in large part to Bridges' performance. From start to finish, The Big Lebowski is an engaging comedy that is very entertaining and a lot of fun to watch. It is a visual feast for the eyes -- in particular, The Dude's dream sequences which are simultaneously hilarious and breathtaking. This is the Coens in top form.The Big Lebowski may not have the dramatic weight or substance of Fargo, but it has a distinctive charm uniquely its own. The joy of this film is in watching all the entertaining diversions, subplots and minor characters and how The Dude interacts with them all. You are not supposed to really care about what happens to the convoluted storyline or how it is resolved. That is merely window-dressing for the Coens to showcase this highly engaging world they've created.

One-almost everything said in this film is downright hilarious. And Two-the F word is spoken 281 times so there's not many sentences that don't contain it. 144 sentences also end in 'man'.Jeff 'The Dude' Lebowski is a man living a minimalistic existence. He has no job, no ambitions and no worries. His days, be they weekdays or weekends, are spent bowling, driving around or having the occasional acid flashback. His pals are Walter Sobchak, a security expert and half-crazed Vietnam vet and Donny, a humble, mousy little man who is left out of almost every conversation.The Dude is happy with his easy-going life of nothingness until two thugs ambush him in his house believing him to the OTHER Jeff 'The Big' Lebowski, the millionaire with a trouble-making wife who owes money all over town. These thugs are none too happy with their dumb error and re-assert themselves by peeing on The Dude's rug.This very much displeases The Dude as this rug really tied the room together and since he cannot track down the 'Chinaman' thug responsible he decides to take it out of the Big Lebowski, as it's now HIM who owes a new rug. The Dude is welcomed into the Big Lebowski's mansion by Brandt the butler, a man so appallingly sycophantic he'd make Weylon Smither's look bad. But his millionaire namesake is not so ready and willing to give hand-outs and basically tells The Dude to get lost.At this point things become quite complicated as a bunch of ex-pop star Nihilist thugs, a powerful pornographer, a dejected feminist daughter, a Brother Seamus (NOT an Irish Monk), a joyriding teenager, a revolting pederast champion bowler, Saddam Hussein, a mysterious cowboy and a doctor who is insistent on him removing his shorts all make The Dude's life suddenly a helluva lot more interesting. The plot thickens and thickens and the dude is dragged to dozens of different places across LA, going from limo to limo, never too far from a white Russian or a doobie.There are zillions of idiosyncrasies in this film that keeps it new and interesting every time you watch it. Every scene and every line of dialogue is so memorable that, like me, you'll be acting the film out for years. Even on a 100th viewing you'll notice dramatic ironies, character arcs and ingenious wordplay that went right over your head before.The acting is superb. I am a fan of Jeff Bridges but he completely disappears in this film. He truly BECOMES The Dude and shows little of his recognisable self. John Goodman, in probably the most under-rated role of his career, is the world's angriest man. Bringing frustration and smart-ass arrogance to every scene (though he's almost always right). Set well over a decade after 'nam (and during the first Gulf conflict) Walter seems to be suffering from perpetual, ever-lasting post-traumatic stress syndrome as he blows up in any situation. Take a look at his 'minor' confrontation with Smokey for example.It's not about plot, or even characters. It's about a certain moment in time, the early 90s.

The Big Lebowski, however, is ten times the movie Fargo is.The characters are just great. Even minor characters get special quirks that make them far more interesting than the major characters in most recent movies. And the protagonist, Jeff \"The Dude\" Lebowski (Jeff Bridges), is the kind of guy who wanders down to the supermarket in his bathrobe at night to write a 69 cent check for a carton of milk. I'm tired of boring, ridiculously one-dimensional main characters who get close-ups every other second while using lines like, \"I'm not going back without my men!\" The Dude is an unlikely hero if there ever was one, and that is why he is a most refreshing and memorable one. There's The Dude's best friend Walter (John Goodman), a well-read and impulsive Vietnam vet; Jesus, the purple -clad sex offender/bowler; Maude Lebowski(Juliane Moore), the feminist artist who speaks of \"coitus\"; and a crazed group of ideologically-confused nihilists, among so many other great characters. The dialogue is priceless.The plot is very unique and ridiculous, but it fits the movie absolutely perfectly. The Dude and Walter get involved in a shady world of kidnapping , embezzlement, porn, reactionary cops, and just about everything else, when all the Dude ever wanted was compensation for a rug of his that had been urinated on by confused debt collectors who were looking for a different man also named Jeff Lebowski.

I am very fond of their work. Throughout their irreverent career, they have explored different subjects and themes. Their best stories evolve from kidnapping schemes in films like \"Raising Arizona \" and \"Fargo\", one of my very favorites. I thought that film was fervently free. I was so ever wrong. It's as if the Coen Brothers have celebrated their complete breakthrough success (Academy Award winners), and now are willing to do whatever they please. \"The Big Lebowski\" is a film so meandering, so wonderfully novel, that I found myself missing the many other sporadic jokes as I was heaving from laughter. The film is basically about mistaken identity, eccentric characters, and a soiled rug. This film extols the bowler, the allies, even the pins. We experience an actual bowling ball POV, as the Dude (Jeff Bridges) hallucinates. This film has nihilists, feminists, millionares, paedophiles, drugged out hippies, underachieving students, incompetent criminals, pornographers and 'Nam veterans. This movie is open to anything , anything... Some people are turned off by absurd looniness, because it's so grandiosely different. Yet who couldn't chuckle, if not explode, when a bowler dressed in a tight purple suit licks a bowling ball's finger hole, and the camera pans down to reveal his name as Jesus!

Any comparison to later films is doomed at the start because the techniques and features are so different. I did not feel the acting was at all remarkable, but the total composition was quite moving. I appreciated Dreyer's blend of cynicism, faith, hope, anger, and pity in the performances of the judges. He showed Joan's piety more in their changing reactions to her than in Falconetti's performance. I could not imagine her leading troops in battle. The trial probably did take a lot of Joan's self-confidence away, but Falconetti's wide-eyed woebegone tentative Joan, doing her duty despite her fear, generated only pity and respect for her courage. Who would follow a person like that? Christ after his betrayal kept a commanding presence. It was almost as if Dreyer looked at all the martyr sculptures, created a consummate victim for his film play, and forgot about the real person who caused the controversy in the first place. Falconetti's Joan would fit in well with the Children's Crusade, but was no Deborah or Boudicca leading troops, or even the Joan who passed muster with the King's counselors before being sent off to battle.The \"Voices of Light\" soundtrack and the composition as a whole worked beautifully together on the DVD as a fascinating work of art. The end result was like a Ken Burns special or a video catalog of images, giving a two-dimensional detailed look at a time and place. Is it the best Joan ever? Perhaps it is more authentic than some, but it has a clear emotional bias that makes it no different than any other well-made agenda-driven film. I purchased it rather than seeing \"Messenger\" because of the almost universal praise for the older film from critics reviewing Besson's version.

Maria Falconetti is unforgettable as Joan, perfectly distilling the pain, terror, and saintliness required by what is probably one of the most demanding roles an actor could attempt.

In fact, it left such an enormous impact on me that I have not been able to see it again since, not wanting to undermine the overwhelming, spiritual epiphany that I deeply felt I had experienced the first time. A very stubborn and silly attitude, I know, and one which I hope to overcome in the near future, once I come to terms with the infinitely important statements it makes on the very extremes of human nature.The Passion of Joan of Arc is work of art in the truest and purest sense of the term; it is a timeless expression of the eternal human conflict, namely the yearning for the ideal - the spiritual connection which binds all of humankind. It is a statement without time or place, language or nationality, and set religious system or dogma. I think that's where the true power of this film lies; in the fact that it concentrates on the exploration of universal human emotions and themes in a simple story, rather then having it's power and timelessness detracted from by an overly complex plot and other timely constructions.Since this is one of my first reviews here, the first two being Tarkovsky's Sacrifice and Nostalgia, I'll arrange my thoughts as much as possible to not make this overlong and gushing. Just want to comment on certain aspects of this film which particularly struck me. First of all, was the sense that this was one unified work of art, every element of film working together seamlessly, to form a coherent picture with a unique clarity of spirit, which feels very unencumbered by excess. The sublime orchestration of music and images overwhelmed me with its poignancy; it was like music for all of the senses, always keeping everything at a high plane of emotion, accentuating the transcendent feeling I had throughout.Falconetti as Joan, as I've heard many times before, is the best performance ever captured on film, hands down. Even before there was \"method\" acting, she embodied it. You could feel every emotion she felt, because you sensed she was never holding anything back. With the whole movie done in closeups, the indescribably expressive quality of her face only intensifies, making her's and your involvement much more personal.It is not only Falconetti's relentless portrait of suffering that comes through to the viewer, but most powerfully, the spiritual glory and triumph which shines through her luminous eyes in the midst of the worst suffering, which shows her pure spirit and the strength of her faith. That is what most stayed with me about this film, even after the horrifying closing moments of her burning body on the stake.

He held out and told them that he wanted the title role and even though at the time his wife was pregnant, they had very little money and he was hanging by a thread, he took that stand. And the rest is history. Could you imagine anyone else in that role now? Does anyone really fit the mold that Stallone made for us? No. And this film inspires me to be more than I am. It inspires the dreamer in all of us to go for what we want and damn the consequences. If I ever meet Stallone one day, I will personally thank him for making this film.

Stories like ROCKY have been told and re-told time and time again. Rags-to-riches, hero gets the girl, etc., right? Yes, but the way ROCKY is told puts one of my all time favorites many Art Museum steps above the rest. Sylvester Stallone was actually an actor back in the seventies and quite a writer. His raw emotion and presence on-screen makes \"Rocky Balboa\" real and original. The film ironically parallels Stallone's now legendary struggle to get it made his way. Could you imagine Burt Reynolds as \"Rocky\"? Me neither. Stallone turned down a lot of money to just take a writing credit but he fought his way to the top and revolutionized the actor-screenwriter dimension of film-making.ROCKY is as predictable as tic-tac-toe. Who cares? The music, the setting, the characters, and the fight make it the American classic it is. \"Philadelphia's favorite son\" goes through what no fighter in professional boxing could ever possibly imagine. (What world champ would pick a challenger out of a book because of his name?) Director John G. Avildsen puts the exclamation point on Sly's screenplay by isolating the characters and showing their depressingly small world on the dank streets of South Philly. Each performance, especially Burt Young's, is unique. Stallone's yelling match with \"Mickey\"(Burgess Meredith), his long-time, \"broken-down pug\" trainer is as powerful as anything Brando did in ON THE WATERFRONT. The movie draws from its cinematic ancestors well. The likes of BODY AND SOUL and SOMEBODY UP THERE LIKES ME are oh so present throughout.Notice the similarity between Carl Weathers as \"Apollo Creed\" and Muhammad Ali. Pretty close aren't they? This is not accidental. Stallone supposedly saw a fight between Ali and the latest great white hope of the 70's named Chuck Wepner. The two went the distance in 1974 and Stallone immediately had an idea. Several typewriters and notebooks later, he had a story no one wanted to produce. This is the essence of the parallel between art and reality. Stallone became a name and a superstar because of his spirit and fight. He reflects it all rather well in ROCKY.Boxing is a great sport to make a film about and the most important aspect may be the fight scenes. Of the 5 ROCKY films, the original has the most realistic fight. Stallone, who even choreographed the boxing scenes, has a great feel for the sport and its inner workings, all very essential. The training sequence provides enough motivation for any couch potato watching to get off his or her butt and get in shape.

Stallone's performance was good, but not Oscar-worthy. All of the other characters play secondary roles in the film and don't really make a huge impact maybe with the exception of Mickey (Burgess Meredith). Perhaps if we had seen more interaction between Mickey and Rocky instead of a lot of wasted time following Rocky around Philadelphia, the movie would have been that much better.I found the final fight scene in this film to be somewhat fake, because all of the boxing is pure offence. Rocky takes a turn beating on Creed and vise versa. Creed also seems unscathed after the 15 round match whereas Rocky doesn't look like the same Rocky that entered the ring. The film ends rather abruptly which I think was a very smart move. There was really no need to get into the after-fight details because they simply would have added very little to the story (also making room for a sequel(s)).7/10 stars."}, {"rank": 213, "name": "Rocky", "movie_year": "1976", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "One of the greatest movies ever made.

However, not that many people knew him or followed his career even after he won that Oscar except for his biggest fans. So \"Platoon\" could be considered to be his breakthrough movie and not only because it won Oscars for best picture and a best director one for him, but because it was really good. \n Chris (Charlie Sheen) has dropped out of college to volunteer for the army to go to Vietnam. But once he gets there, he realizes that the war really isn't how he thought it might be. He sees the horrors of the war and lives them as well. Also, there are two sergeants in his platoon and they are complete opposites; Sergeant Barnes (Tom Berenger) is a crazy man who kills any Vietnamese person as soon as he or she is in site. And then there is Sergeant Elias (Willem Dafoe) who is completely against the war and probably wouldn't be there if he had a choice. And so there is this hate rivalry between Barnes and Elias. Barnes even goes as far as killing Elias in a very cowardly way. Throughout the movie, there is Sheen's voice-over telling his experiences with the intermediate of letters he writes to his grand-mother. The movie is a biography of Stone's experience in Vietnam and you can see how he just hated the war and considered it incredibly stupid. The scenes in the Vietnamese villages are very powerful and the whole movie is very well directed.

In Platoon, Oliver Stone tackled the subject of the Vietnam War, and by saying his film was autobiographical ensured more people took it as the gospel truth on what really happened in Vietnam. Actually, it has been proved that he did not experience many of the events of the film, such as the village incident. The biggest inaccuracy of this film is the fact that everything befalling this one platoon would not, could not and did not happen in the time span of this film. During nearly all patrols in reality the enemy was hardly ever seen or heard. The biggest problem an ordinary GI would face was boredom. Also, contrary to what Stone would like everyone to think, not everyone in Vietnam was a drunk or doper. In addition, I find it hard to believe that Chris Taylor would write home to his grandmother such truths as \"Somebody once wrote: Hell is the impossibility of reason. That's what this place feels like: Hell.\" Likewise, his voiceover at the end commenting that his platoon's biggest problem was fighting itself, was a little simplistic, especially in view of the bodies of the final battle and other enemy encounters.The absence of a real plot did not seem to me to matter, as Stone was just trying to show what it was like in Vietnam, even if he did try to rewrite history, rather than tell a story. There were some good elements to the film apart from the fact that it was good viewing to watch; these included its jungle scenes and combat sequences and the fact that the GI uniform, living conditions, age, language and equipment was accurately portrayed. I also enjoyed the acting and became drawn into the conflict between Elias and Barnes.

I was constantly afraid that the next step would set off a trap, or there were Viet Cong soldiers lurking somewhere in the trees. It was the most nerve-wracking experience I've ever had in a movie. It scared me more than any horror film I've ever seen, yet, it's that very fear that makes the ultimate statement in the movie.Stone paints a gruesome picture of war through they eyes of one soldier. Charlie Sheen's subdued performance is perfect for this film. We can literally see his tranformation from a clueless green soldier to a gritty, experienced veteran of war. It's a transformation that we as viewers can follow and understand. We all experience his emotions, fears, and curiosity about war. And we are taken along for the ride without any veils pulled over our eyes.This film is far and away the greatest war movie ever. It illustrates both the good and bad about American soldiers and war in general. War can sometimes turn grown men into monsters. It can sometimes turn monsters into grown men. Oliver Stone does a brilliant job in illustrating this. his decision to narrate the story through Charlie Sheen's character is both effective and brilliant. It provides the audience with an understanding and a face to attach the horror to.In so many ways this movie is superior to Private Ryan. Its story is universal and broad while its focus is perfectly condensed and realized.Bravo to Platoon!"}, {"rank": 215, "name": "Platoon", "movie_year": "1986", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "I thought that this movie was an incredibly realistic look about one group of soldiers. A lot of War movies are non-stop, heart-pounding action. But this movie was more realistic. It showed that the Vietnam war was about more than just the battle. It showed man against the elements. The scenes with the red-ants, snakes, and the jungle made the movie easier to relate to the characters. I also think this movie is about drugs. It seemed that all the characters who were against the actual fighting were the ones getting stoned every night. I think if the soldiers back then would have kept their noses clean, they would have had a much better effect in the Vietnam war. However, I think that there is no reason for war, I can't see why we all just don't get along. Maybe it was good that the States got their butts kicked. It was about time.

Nothing takes place elsewhere on the globe except for being inside the bloody, torturable action at Vietnam. If you're a veteran of the Army or Marines who still carries a peace sign, then you'll see why this picture (and as with many others) is gratefully dedicated. This appeared to be a first for the screen, perhaps a step above other war films. It paints a hair-gripping portrait at fighting during the Vietnam War with strong attention to graphic details based on extremely true and tense situations. You might complain that this looks nearly like another 80s war action movie with no real substance, but this put into effect is demanding along with tensions, pain, and suffering on the battleground, which is conceivably portrayed. Take very careful notice of the end conclusion, which is horrifyingly true! While I'm waiting to see SAVING PRIVATE RYAN for the first time, this movie was best for starts.

Oliver Stone's portrayal of the Vietnam War was extremely good. This movie tops over any other Vietnam war movie ever made. For a movie made in 1986, it had incredible stunts.

I have not got tired of it either."}, {"rank": 215, "name": "Platoon", "movie_year": "1986", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "I am a Quaker, meaning someone who does not believe in war. My view is that wars are a form of killing of the poor, the lower middle class, people get killed because there were no other jobs available to them except to join the military. It is also a form of making money, selling armaments and the struggle for power. I might be wrong in that! But that is my opinion.When this movie came out I was in law school and I was fighting my own war at school as law school is much similar to a military regime. I was a basket case! This movie put terror in my head! I was terrified. I said that I would never watch a war movie again in my life! But I have overruled that principle. I felt that Chris, Charlie Sheen, had made a mistake that he admits in his letters to his grandmother. I kept asking myself why is this kid writing to the grandmother and not his mother. I have watched most of Stone's movies and had read most books written about him. I sense that this movie is autobiographic. Stone and his father could not see eye to eye on things, his parents got divorced when he was fifteen if I am not mistaken. He felt betrayed because he did not suspect that the divorce was coming and perhaps decided that he was alone in the world! When Stone was at Yale he decided to volunteer when he did not have to! Oh, God! Bless his soul! He believed innocently that he could serve his country. Viet Nam changed a naive innocent recruit who went to war, and allowed him to see the ambiguity of the war. The platoon started fighting between itself and killing innocent civilians, because the two sergeants could not get along. This conflict of choice turns the young recruit into a man that we now know as one the best writers, directors, producers of our days. As Chris, Stone seems to have his own opinions about things, (Stone is also the only child and this is an only child syndrome), he comes up with projects that he feels are the right thing to do and does them alive or dead! Stone parallels Chris' choice to go to war in his own life. He is very independent. There is always a price to pay for being independent! That is clear in Platoon.I could never come up with stuff that Stone does. Still after having seen all that atrocity and although his movies are full of violence, he did not lose his faith and tenderness as one can see him in a cameo appearance in his movie Salvador, right at the beginning of the movie Stone kisses a little boy. Stone has a worldwide view because he himself admits feeling like a foreigner, his mother was a French Catholic woman and his father was Jewish. This movie is \"one of the best war movies ever made\", and Oscar worthy movie to me. As a woman, who is not a believer of war, the movie is about paying the price of our decisions. Chris as well as Oliver Stone did not have to volunteer to go to Viet Nam. They felt that they could make a difference as a young men going to war. Stone was wounded and earned a purple heart. The cast in this movie is superb as well as the music.This is my parallel perception of the story of Chris/Stone in the platoon .. .

Rookie marine Chris Taylor (Charlie Sheen) is projected in one leap from the security of middle America to the blood and squalor of a war which can never be won.Uncompromising in its use of soldier's language and graphic violence, the plot follows Taylor through a hellish baptism in a platoon made up of psychotics, criminals and plain murderers. Initially he is shunned by the veterans, but slowly develops the skills and traits of a combat Marine - having to suspend all thoughts of decent living in the process. Like all around him, the countdown to the end of his tour becomes a fixation.In this no-rules environment, rivalries amongst the men take on brutish proportions and the domineering Barnes (Tom Berenger) battles with a fellow sergeant (Willem Dafoe) with, as far as Barnes is concerned, only one suitable outcome. From the chilling silence of the jungle to the thunderous roar of full scale battle, this is a tense film, but with clear moral messages from Stone - war has no winners.

Thousands of young men died for no apparent reason. Oliver Stone makes no direct attempt to answer this question. Every bit of the movie's action takes place in the jungles of Vietnam around 1967 and 1968. However, the horror and madness we see on screen leaves you with a sad feeling in your heart and we realize we absolutely did not belong there, fighting amidst a civil war within a peasant country we knew nothing about. Stone himself fought in the war and this was his experience, with Charlie Sheen playing his alter ego. As Sheen says during the closing narration, \"we didn't fight the enemy, we fought ourselves.\"Many people have drawn comparisons between PLATOON and Coppola's APOCALYPSE NOW, a spectacular film in its own right. These are two distinctly different visions of the war, PLATOON being a gritty, documentary-like version with APOCALYPSE the surreal, fictionalized account. PLATOON is the better war film because of its honest, in-your-face style. Stone utilized hand-held cameras to capture combat in a way never seen before. We get to know the characters of this platoon and how 'civil wars' probably broke out within American units themselves. There are no tricky shots, nor do we see any glamorization of war, as seen in such films as THE RED BADGE OF COURAGE. This is not an artistic depiction of Vietnam like APOCALYPSE NOW. It is bloody realism shown in quite graphic detail, the way it may have been, based on Stone's own experiences.The supporting cast is superb, painting a non-stereotypical portrait of tragic characters. Of course, Tom Berenger's 'Barnes' and Willem Dafoe's 'Elias', are symbolic of the good and evil that most likely existed within some units. These two characters are essential to the inner struggles going on in Sheen's 'Chris'. The battle scenes are shot in such a way that we are put right in the middle of the action, seeing what the soldiers saw. It is nearly impossible to know where the enemy is and who you are shooting at, and there is a frightening scene involving Sheen as the platoon's lookout, who is paralyzed with fear, unable to act while the enemy creeps upon them. The madness of the war is more emotionally powerful than in APOCALYPSE because we are closer to these events and there are virtually no breaks in intensity.I ask anyone who disagrees with my assessment regarding this film and APOCALYPSE to watch both back to back. Anti-war films are at their best when we are moved emotionally, and I assure you will be more wiped out after PLATOON. Again, APOCALYPSE is a great movie, however, do you really care about a fictional mission up a river to kill an insane American? You be the judge. PLATOON and SAVING PRIVATE RYAN are the two most emotionally shattering and best anti-war films."}, {"rank": 215, "name": "Platoon", "movie_year": "1986", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "To me, this was a surprise from Oliver \"Reagan-is-a-fascist\" Stone.

This story about a woman running for her life from a futuristic cyborg programmed to assassinate her is more human than technological. I hope that Cameron never loses that quality because I've always admired it and noticed it in every one of his films from THE TERMINATOR to ALIENS to THE ABYSS to T2 to TITANIC. There's lots of special effects, but he never fails to breathe life into his human characters. I am like a lot of people, I really like Michael Biehn and every movie I've ever seen with him in it. He never gets the kind of attention he deserves, and this early role of Kyle Reese, the human soldier who risked ultimately everything to travel over time to help protect Sarah Connor, was the first nuanced hint of his amazing talent and is still my favorite role of his. And I'm certainly glad I'm not strange for thinking that the brief love affair that the two had was a touching and fitting though very surprising ingredient to the story. To me, the talk that they have about the bleakness and pain that Reese knows is in the future and the sudden and unexpected discovery of their love is making a subtle, yet profound statement, like saying hope in the stead of hopelessness, life in the place of lifelessness, and joy and love in the place of hate and violence and pain.

There was no real danger level in T2 -- even though Robert Patrick's T-1000 character is superior to Schwarzenegger's Terminator.Also, Arnold's flat unemotional villian is superior to his flat, unemotional hero. Arnold's better as a villian.The scene in which the Terminator invades the human compound in the future is perhaps the bleakest in cinematic history, complete with off-screen sobbing from a woman, who's crying perhaps embodies the hopelessness of the situation.Cameron has worked better with smaller budgets -- shortening his film and narrowing his focus.

T2 is very good, but when I watch The Terminator, and I find myself wanting to memorize five or six lines or even write a book about humanoid machines or time travel, I realize that this one is much more exciting and impressive. Besides, that kid in T2 really annoys me.Linda Hamilton and Arnold Schwarzenegger do a good job, but Michael Biehn is the one who does not get enough credit for this movie. However, he was lucky enough to get the best lines by far. \"That Terminator is out there. It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear; and it absolutely will not stop, ever, until you are dead!\" That line would be good if only said well, but when Biehn says it, it might be my favorite line of all time; and there are several other great lines in The Terminator.I can't think of one general thing that is bad about this movie. Aside from the afore mentioned dialogue, action, and acting(which includes the actors with smaller parts like Paul Winfield, Lance Henriksen, Earl Boen and Bill Paxton), the plot is brilliant, the music is great, and even the performance and handling of the dogs was impressive!I used to think that Empire Strikes Back was my favorite movie, but since recently watching The Terminator, after not having seen it in years, I'm pretty sure this is my favorite film of all time.Jeremy Barger http://clubs.yahoo.com/clubs/firegodsmovieclub"}, {"rank": 218, "name": "The Terminator", "movie_year": "1984", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "I don't care what people say about how bad they think this film is.

I was about 15 and saw it on video knowing nothing about it and I was blown away. For the first time the 'bad guy' didn't tie people up, drag out a death scene only to be thwarted at the minute. No this finally showed what a true killing machine would do. There's two great remarks in the film that I only picked up on repeated viewings: \"Stay in a public place and you'll be safe\" and \"There's over 30 cops in this building, what could happen to you\" (sorry not a direct quote words to that affect). These statements are then blown away as The Terminator just destroys everything that gets in his way.On top of this refreshing callous violence is the wonderfully developed love story between Reece and Connor. It's so well done that the character interplay takes place at the same time as the main action.I could go on and on as to why I love this film, but I'll leave it there.By the way T2 was such a disappointment when compared to this. >10/10"}, {"rank": 218, "name": "The Terminator", "movie_year": "1984", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "I am a big fan of James Cameron.

It's about a great war in the future: machines vs. humans. After years of combat, the humans eventually win under the leadership of Captain John Conner, and as a final counterattack, the machines blast a cyborg back through time to destroy the mother of Conner before he was born, thus preventing the humans' victory. But Conner finds out about the plan, and he sends back a military man of his own. So it's pretty much a battle of cat-and-mouse around the city of New York, as the military man, Kyle Reese (Michael Biehn) tries to protect Sarah Conner (Linda Hamilton) from his ruthless, unstoppable cyborg counterpart (Arnold Schwarzenegger). Jammed with breathtaking action scenes and believable performances, this movie became an instant classic, and director James Cameron, who would later win an Oscar for directing \"Titanic,\" got instant recognition.The dark colors alone in the movie make it memorable....(Can anyone recall more than about a minute of daytime in this film?) providing atmosphere that works. Awesome Arnie is also effecient as the Terminator, the ruthless cyborg, as he stalks Sarah and kills anyone who he has to in pursuit of her. But really, this is Linda Hamilton and Michael Biehn's movie, as their characters are forced to survive together and Sarah must come to grips with the fact that she's the mother of the world's savior. Romance blossoms, of course, and all in all, I think it's the human story behind those two that really makes the film effective. Therefore, Arnold's really a backdrop for a bigger picture. His story really shows up in the sequel, which is also a great film.See \"The Terminator\" if you have not yet.

Now don't get me wrong, I think that Arnold did one hell of a job as the terminator, but i know that Biehn's Kyle Reese, gets far less credit than he's supposed to. This movie wasn't based on action, but rather plot, and acting. Michael Biehn gives a greater performance as Kyle Reese, than any of the actors did with their parts. We can see his tough character of the future trying to make it in the relatively calm world of the present. Kyle also gives the best lines in any of the terminator movies. We can forget one-liners and concentrate on Biehn's powerful speeches. Stuff like, \"That terminator is out there. It can't be bargained with, it can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop. Ever. Until you are dead.\" And, \"Nobody get home. Nobody else comes through.

Like Kyle Reese, Corporal Hicks in Aliens, Hirram Coffey in The Abyss, Johnny Ringo in Tombstone, and major roles in Navy seals, and The Rock.

For this movie he was a massively built oak tree of a man. His strange accent makes for a perfect callous robotic sounding killing machine. It's almost like his voice is a computer read out ( which I guess it is in one sense ). Terminator is one of those films that started something huge. People didn't realize it at the time, but the careers of Arnold, Cameron and perhaps even guys like Micahel Biehn, Lance Henriksen and even Bill Paxton were substantially started because of this film. And Cameron must have liked working with them so much that he gave all of them substantial roles in his next film ( Aliens ).As we all know what the story is, I'll just tell you a bit about what is so fascinating about it. First I have to mention Michael Biehn. He has the real starring role. He is the character that has to explain everything to the audience. He has to explain this complicated story so that we know what is happening and why. It is not an easy job to do something like that and still come off looking all right. But Biehn is simply awesome in this film. A microcosm of his performance can be seen when Sara bites him. Biehn ( Kyle Reese ) replies \" Terminator's don't feel pain. I do. Don't do that again. \" That is such a great line delivered with the perfect expression, the perfect tone and the perfect timing. Biehn is perfect for the role.This is also the first film that I saw as a youngster that ever warned me of the dangers of nuclear war and of the rapid advancements of machinery. Perhaps I was too young and naive to fully understand all that James Cameron was trying to say, but now that I am older, I can honestly say that the two Terminators are perfect anti nuke films. And they are so passionate with what they have to say. I like it when a film has something to say. I enjoy being entertained in the process but if you can manage both then you have a masterpiece. This is a masterpiece.Finally. there are two other reasons to enjoy this film. One, this is the first film where \"I'll be back\" was spoken. Now it is part of Arnolds vernacular. Secondly, Bill Paxton is in it. And he adds spark to any film that he's in. Especially here, as the idiot punk leader that really gets the hell beat out of him, he has some great lines.A great film."}, {"rank": 218, "name": "The Terminator", "movie_year": "1984", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "This is one of the FEW Sci-Fi movies I have watched over and over and over and (you get the point (others like it are CONTACT))...

The Terminator succeeds on many levels, many of which have been commented on by other viewers. In general, I think this movie is distinguished by one of the most original and compelling story lines to ever come out of Hollywood. An aspect of the Terminator that has always fascinated me is how it presents the idea of machine against human and machine against machine, and on a deeper level, how humans can both benefit and suffer from the machines they create. The most compelling aspect of the film for me is how the Terminator is presented: a machine with only one main function, that of killing Sarah Conner. Even though the robot needs to utilize a number of complex maneuvers in order to carry out its function, its sole purpose boils down to that one thing. That's what Kyle Reese means when he tells Sarah that the Terminator doesn't feel remorse and absolutely will not stop, ever, until she is dead. How fitting, then, that the only thing that Sarah is able to use to stop the Terminator is another machine that is even more remorseless than the Terminator, an industrial hydraulic press that knows only two commands, \"up\" and \"down\", and, like the Terminator, \"absolutely will not stop, ever\", until it is down.

I hate to be nostalgic knowing that it is something gone and you can never get it back. I cry every time I see this movie, especially when the two departed at the end. The casting cannot be perfect. They are exactly what they are. I would say this River Phoenix's best acting. There are few good movies like this one that has a lasting effect on you after you watch it. Too bad one of the actors died so young. Imagine they themselves look at this movie 20 years later. I highly recommend this movie. I myself tend to control myself not to see it again in fear of plunging myself again into those nostalgic scenes. One thing I would like to mention that this movie unlike all the formulaic ones with girls and sex shows an intimate or perhaps a little bit subtle hint of male mutual attraction undertone in it.

River Phoenix by himself is award winning. One of his greatest roles next to My Own Private Idaho.Rob Reiner did an absolutely amazing job explaining the friendships that boys have during their teenage years. It is heart-warming watching these 4 young actors: Wil Wheaton (Gordie Lachance), River Phoenix (Chris Chambers), Corey Feldman (Teddy Duchamp), and Jerry O'Connell (Vern Tessio), take a journey through the woods in search of a dead body, while they spend their two day trip swearing, telling stories, and hitting each other with constant, and hilarious jokes and caps. It is also great that the story can be so entertaining, and with no love interests. It is much more realistic without a girl getting in the middle of the story. Most movies nowadays can't get away without some kind of love interest. So, I applaud that . . . I think most people would.Also, Keifer Sutherland does an amazing job (as usual) being the bad guy (again, as usual). He plays the town hood, Ace Merrill, who makes the boys adventure a living hell. But, in the end, I'm sure you'll find that it all ends up okay.Take my advise, this movie is one to see. If you haven't seen it yet, go and rent it now.

It's written by a genius, Stephen King, & acted by great young actors ( who later were quite famous) like River Phoenix (a kid who was made to grow up fast by force & circumstances), Corey Feldman (the typical crazy & hyperkinetical friend), Jerry O'Connel (the group's \"mascot\") & a great performance of this kid named Wil Wheaton, who is the protagonist of the film.The plot is about this group of 4 friends who decide to start a quest searching for a dead guy's body near a forest. They have to hurry up because another group of friends, older that them (& headed by the great Kiefer Sutherland, playing again, as the whole 80's decade, the role of the teen bad guy) are searching for the same thing.But the real matter of the movie are the dialogues & the developments of its characters, specially the little friends.Gordie is a great character, as the fragile desperate 12 years old kid who wants to escape from his family (he thinks they don't love him) & his bitter past (he feels really pity, even guilty for the death of his brother).The role of River Phoenix, as Chris Chambers, is also awesome, showing us how hard could be for a kid the fact of growing up alone, in a hard way.Jerry O'Connel , as Vern, is the funny & tender point of the picture, making laugh for his ways of seeing life, just thinking that life is still a game.Corey Feldman, as Teddy Duchamp, is terrific. This actor, who once was famous just like Macaulay Culkin & then later disappeared, shows all his arsenal of dramatic profile playing a kid who is crazy about military stuff (he likes to brag that his father was in Vietnam) & acts like he is not afraid of nothing, but in the deep of his heart he know that he is so scary like any of their friends.Other famous actors in this movie are Kiefer Sutherland (playing the bad, bad, bad Ace Merrill), John Cusack (as Gordie's dead older brother) & Richard Dreyfuss as Gordie when adult. There are also great & funny parts of the movie (who can forget the great story of the Pie contest?) & also a lot of dramatic issues, even about existence (the reaction of Gordie after seeing the dead kid's body).Resuming, I think \"Stand by me\" is a GREAT, GREAT movie, also with a great theme (When the night has come, & the land is dark...).

While this is true today, you didn't have life's many pleasures such as video games, or computers.

The movie itself is filled with memorable one-liners (Annette's cleavage), stories (Lard Ass), and scenes (the Leeches).This is the ultimate growing-up movie.

Mike, Gary, Andy and myself were inseparable. And as this film prophesizes correctly, the group has since split up and now I am only good friends with one of them. This movie makes you remember what it was like to have friends when you were 12 and it makes you glad that they were there when they were.The story involves these four kids going on a weekend hike to find a dead kid that apparently got hit by a train. Now if that is all the movie was about, it would probably be pretty boring. But this film explores the fears and anxieties of what it was like to be 12 again. Twelve year olds deal with a plethora of issues and it is not often that adults listen to what kids have to say or see what they deal with. But this film is honest about it's assessment of how they feel.The four boys are played brilliantly by Wil Wheaton, Jerry O'ConnellCoosh from Jerry Maguire ), Corey Feldman and River Phoenix. The story moves along and hits a nerve because of the life that these four actors brings to their characters. There is a real sense of comrarderie between the four of them. But ultimately it is Phoenix that brings the most life to his character and I would say that the milk money scene with him and Gordie (Wheaton) is one of the more touching and poignant scenes ever filmed.What Stand By Me does is brings you back to a time when friendship was more pure and innocent and meant more. You can't help but get caught up in the nostalgia. Perhaps this film means more to me for personal reasons ( as I've already stated ) but it is a wonderful film and it should be enjoyed by everyone.The last line of the movie is so true.

The friendships depicted between the boys are as intense as any they'll ever have in their lives, although they may only last a year or two more.

I then rented most of his movies, and was only let down with about 2 of them. The explorers was terrible. He was so great though, and his biographies have all made me cry.

It's a genuine masterpiece telling of early teenager's chains of thoughts and displays realistically the fears, anxieties and all other important issues in 12-year old boy's minds. 'Stand by me' has a fantastic cast of, among others, Kiefer Sutherland and River Phoenix. The original title of the story, 'The body', was renamed 'Stand by me' after the title song, which occurs throughout the whole film in various adaptions and reflects the specific moods of the moment. I have seen this film in a time-span of about 8 years about 10 times. It seems crazy, but it's the truth. The film is perfect in all its aspects: beginning, plot, characters, '2nd level', and even ending (not one of King's strong points).The film contains no gore, blood, monsters or non-realistic elements as we're used to of King, but is, next to 'The Shawshank Redemption', his best movie.

So it didn't have the same nostalgic sense it had for so many. But what it did, was make me ache for those memories. I wanted (in the words of another reviewer) to be 12, and *that* cool. I wished I had been like that, that I had had friends like that, laughed like that, and had adventures like that.The 'milk-money' scene was probably one of my all-time favourite scenes in movie history. Up until I saw this movie I had never held much regard for River Phoenix, but the poignancy and sincerity which River added to the role of Chris Chambers touched me to the point of tears. I read in yet another review that in this scene, River was asked to think of a time when he had been hurt by an adult, and that even after the cameras stopped rolling, River sat there still, sobbing and hurting. And I felt every tear and heard every word as though I were there with Chris.This movie made me laugh, cry, rejoice and fear with Chris, Gordie, Teddy and Vern. I loved the campfire scenes, and today I look back on my own childhood, and remember with a laugh the amazingly similar things I used to laugh and wonder about with my friends. I remember dreaming about being a writer and an actress, I remember standing up to bullies, I remember walking or riding with my friends, I remember being afraid, and crying onto a friend's shoulder.I guess what this movie does for everyone, is take them back in time, even though the situations may have been different, chances are you'll find the similarities, and remember with a smile that yes, your life was once *that* cool. In the words of Vern, \"a great time\"I especially loved the ending. That they found out who was strong, and who just talked tough.

The enveloping setting for the film is the recollections of the grown-up writer Gordon LaChance of his close childhood friend, Chris Chambers, on reading in the newspaper of his sudden death. It is especially poignant to watch on the anniversary of the death of the actor who played Chris.I would like to share a very touching and thought-provoking anecdote told by the author of \"Lost in Hollywood\", a biography of River Phoenix. During the filming of every movie in which he starred, River attached himself closely to someone else involved as a mentor and father figure. In the case of Stand by Me, this role was played by Robert Reiner, the director (who had wisely prepared his four principals before screening with adventure-wilderness-type activities of the same kind, in order to get them to \"bond.\" It worked!)During several takes of the \"milk-money\" confession scene, River had been unconvincing. Then Reiner asked River to think of a time in his own life when an adult had betrayed him. The result is what we see now-- what turns out to be one of the climactic moments of the film, although perhaps it needn't have been. And the biographer says that when the cameras stopped rolling, River's tears didn't. He kept sobbing and crying uncontrollably, until Reiner comforted him in his arms. Heaven only knows what had happened to River that he was recalling in that scene, but whatever it was was real."}, {"rank": 219, "name": "Stand by Me", "movie_year": "1986", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "This movie was great.

The telecast promises to draw huge numbers. However Howard does not kill himself and rants to the audience that he \"simply ran out of bullsh**\". Faye Dunaway, playing a ratings-seeking programmer decides Beale's ranting and raving could draw a great audience and decides to keep him on the air, much to the anger of William Holden, playing an old producer. Holden's objections don't matter because UBS has been taken over by a greedy corporation represented by Robert DuVall.

But what is UBS to do when the ratings start to drop?My Critique: Perhaps the cinema's greatest satire ever. Dunaway, Holden, and Finch give magnificent performances. DuVall and Ned Beatty are excellence as dark, cold executives. Many films such as \"Easy Rider\", \"The Graduate\", or \"West Side Story\" are called dated. Many say \"Easy Rider\" look ridiculous today. \"Network\" has done something very hard to do. Instead of growing \"dated\", \"Network\" has infact grown even more accurate. Back in the 1970's, \"Network\" could have been considered a drama with a wacky premise. What a difference two decades makes. The idea of an insane man yelling about the problems of the world on television doesn't seem shocking today. FOX already has hours of footage a week described as \"World's Wildest Police Chases\".

Written by Paddy Chayefsky and directed by Sidney Lumet, this film could have starred Steve Guttenberg and still been interesting. But with an all-star cast including William Holden, Faye Dunaway, and Robert Duvall, as well as Peter Finch and Beatrice Straight who received Oscars for their performances, the film takes on an incredible value.The story probably seemed ludicrous in the 1970s, but in the 1990s, well, it still does. Or rather, we want it to. But ignoring our sentiments about television, it's pretty believable. While UBS had the Mao Tse-Tsung hour, Fox is airing When Animals Attack and The World' Scariest Car Chases. They're certainly not too far from Max Schumacher's (William Holden) sarcastic creation \"The Death Hour\".This makes Network strike remarkably close to home and quite effective. But the real skill of this film comes from two performances: Peter Finch as Howard Beale and screenwriter Paddy Chayefsky's tour de force.Finch gives a performance that's absolutely believable, and frankly, it's eerie that he managed to. Beale represents a man so brainwashed by his medium that he actually buys into the fact that life begins and ends on television. Of course, this makes the end all the more funny.The script, although laden with vulgarity, still maintains an honest quality. Scenes such as Beale's meeting with Ned Beatty and most of Beale's monologues are so real that they scare the viewer, yet make him or her chuckle out of mere terror.If nothing else, watch the beginning and the end, because as Lumet's tradition dictates (watch Dog Day Afternoon if you enjoyed Network), the beginning is witty, and the end, well, it'll shock you, but still leave you with a disturbingly black comedic ending.I'd give Network 10 out of 10, although I'd recommend that you see it more than once before passing any major judgments on it."}, {"rank": 221, "name": "Network", "movie_year": "1976", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "I saw this movie when it was first released and thought it was the coolest but it seemed like a satire that could never happen.

Its cinematic equivalent is Network, one of the highlights in the distinguished career of Sidney Lumet - but in this case, the target is more the relentless pursuit of ratings by the networks.While the focus is originally a news programme, it could have been almost anything. The original purpose of the show simply vanishes, an inconvenient detail discarded by the station, safe in the knowledge that the FCC is a toothless tiger. What brings about the change is the mental and nervous breakdown that befalls news anchorman Howard Beale - a role played to perfection by Peter Finch, for which he deservedly won a Best Actor Oscar.The sick man is shamelessly manipulated by Faye Dunaway and Robert Duvall, against the wishes of William Holden, seemingly Finch's only real friend. All these give virtuoso performances - Dunaway in particular stands out for portraying a woman apparently devoid of human feelings at the office, but capable of love outside it.For all the excellent acting - not forgetting Ned Beatty's towering monologue, for which he also received an Academy nomination - this film isn't perfect. My principal complaint is that it feels excessively long, and at times too sprawling and unfocussed for its own good. The ending also somehow doesn't ring true; while the TV execs have been portrayed as money-grubbing scum, capable of almost any excess (including giving air time to terrorists) in search of another point on the ratings, the notion that they are capable of ordering the cold-blooded murder of someone seems too far-fetched.Those points aside, this is an excellent film.

This was based on the recommendations of the people here (@ IMDB) who mostly liked it.I did not like it.

But alongside that, is the fruition of the vision, which is attained by the means of the director, production crew, designers, composers, and of course, actors. Network is a movie that attains greatness on all levels. Actually this movie's moved me to think that in its substance and presentation that it could be successful as a work of theatre. I'm not talking about a below-mediocre rendition, but if it was consistent with the script, could produce what great plays have to offer. This movie makes no claim to great special effects or sweeping landscapes- just a great story based on Chayefsky's vision of the world of television.The signature line of this film is \"I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not going to take it anymore.\" When it comes to the world of television, I think the viewer holds his/her own destiny in their remote control. The story revolves around a suicidal news anchorman, Howard Beale (Peter Finch), who's reaction to being fired leads him to, first, reveal that he will commit suicide on the air, and second, to expose the demented philosophy of the cut-throat environment of television. The premise of Chayefsky's script is an examination of the ethics of the programming in the television industry. In my opinion the independent television viewer gets what they tune in to, the decision is theirs to make. And to be \"as mad as hell\" means that the viewer sees no other alternative than sitting in front of the tube and taking only what it has to offer. And as morbid as it sounds, I think that the occurrence of such a Beale-like figure would produce the same reaction in reality. Can't you envision the \"enraged\" masses of people rallying behind such a loose cannon, who is virtually telling them to \"get mad\" about something that they already have means to overcome. This movie touches upon the ideas of the current censure trends and will surely produce a anger inside oneself. This movie is unlike anything produced in Hollywood, with exception of the rendition of Ayn Rand's Fountainhead, because it based only on ideas. The content of this movie demands that the viewer to bring along their rational mind.Chayefsky has created a treatise that leads the individual to evaluate ones relationship to the television set. Is it your guide to the outside world? Is it your entertainment? Is it the teacher of your political and spiritual philosophy? Has it given meaning to your life?

Besides the macro-elements, which have been discussed heavily in these pages (prediction of a fourth network that would have to resort to sensationalism to survive; i.e., Fox, WB, UPN), many micro-elements are woven into the script. A prime example is when when Bill Holden's wife confronts him about his affair with Faye Dunaway and goes through a range of emotions, cleanly cutting away from one to the next, as though television channels were being switched. At the end she exhorts her husband to \"say something,\" for he is not 'keeping up with the script.' The romance of noble characters like Holden, making a quixotic attempt to keep the course of the river from being changed while tragically oblivious to the fact that they were fully swept into the current long ago and are helplessly being washed out to sea, is devastatingly powerful. Unlike most movies these days, which you forget by the time you get to your car, this one leaves not only a lasting impression, but the sense that only after multiple viewings will you be able to thresh out all that has occurred or been implied, and even then you're not sure if you've caught everything.

Simple as it may sound, it doesn't begin to explain how funny and how cynical this movie is. Finch is great as the prophet Howard Beale, whose legitimately insane (and profane) ramblings draw huge audiences, as is Dunaway, as the highly-driven programmer behind Beale's show. Holden is also good as the depressing ex-news dept. head, whose friendship with Beale is strained by Beale's new-found insanity.

The script by the late Paddy Chayefsky is full of gems, as well as some of the best movie monologues ever. In particular, Ned Beatty's \"you have meddled with the primal forces of nature!\" tirade is riveting. The performances are outstanding, with Peter Finch masterfully playing latter-day prophet Howard Beale; William Holden as Beale's friend and associate; and Faye Dunaway as a bitch-on-wheels programming director. As I mentioned in my critique on \"Taxi Driver\", these two films paint a portrait of the world that is as dark and realistic now than 23 years ago. \"Network\" describes a world in which ratings are emphasized over content, and with the amount of cliched sitcoms, reality-based dramas, and talk shows that border on exploitation, the ideas in the film have manifested in the 1990s.

William Holden, Faye Dunaway, and Robert Duvall give great support, but it is Peter Finch's portrayal of Howard Beale that steals the show. Beale is a has-been news anchor at UBS (a low-rated, boring network on the verge of financial collapse). After he is fired, Beale informs his audience on the next news cast that he will blow his brains out on \"live\" television. This causes a stir amongst the listening audience and the network's corporate boss (Duvall). Dunaway's character feels compelled to capitalize on this overwhelming state of affairs, in hopes of improving the network's ratings. Beale capitalizes on the situation too. He gives a moving speech that causes ratings at the network to sky rocket. Soon, Beale develops his own talk show. The only distraction of the movie is when Dunaway and Holden get into an extra-marital affair (boring). Later on, Beale's ratings start to fall and the network's corporate staff develop a strategy that will keep it from going down the tubes again."}, {"rank": 221, "name": "Network", "movie_year": "1976", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Out of every movie that I've ever seen, this is the one that packs the most wisdom from a nutcase that I've ever seen. Like Apocalypse Now would do three years later, Network plays with the idea that the entire world is crazy, and that only a few select people are sane. Of course, they appear insane to the rest of the world because they go against the norm. Peter Finch plays Howard Beale, a man driven over the edge by life in general. He at first gives up living, but then has a revelation. He preaches the worth of the human life, he preaches being different, he preaches individuality and warns about the dangers of TV. This is one of the ultimate ironies, because the easiest way one can see Howard Beale is through TV. His proclamations will make you rethink your life, and if you have found yourself in one of life's little ruts, you ought to check out this black comedy.

It's fun and enjoyable and is considered of the greatest work done by the collaboration of Lumet and Paddy Chayefsky which didn't last any further than this picture. Having said that, the only problem that I have with this film is the supposedly truth implied behind the paranoia of Howard Beale. The anti Arab sentiments asserted in this film are obviously part of Chayefsky true feelings. They could have been part of the general American people's feelings at a time when an ally (or a homeland to Chayefsky) was defeated at war, but it probably was because of the Arab refusal to be treated like camel and tried to take control over their own oil and raised the prices after cutting its production for several weeks. The assertion that Arabs were on their way to own America through buying the big companies is laughable. If Arabs could have thought of buying an important television network in the 70's or even in the 80's, I don't think that would have helped distort \"the real thing\", but on the contrary, it could have helped on making some sense or balance in evening world news. However this film is not specifically about this certain political agenda. It's about the power of media, the new world order, future of governments and the \"one vast and ecumenical holding company, for whom all men will work to serve a common profit, in which all men will hold a share of stock, all necessities provided, all anxieties tranquilized, all boredom amused.\" It's about the fear of the future that is caused by today.

And as unreasonable and unrealistic as it seemed at the time... nowadays, it is frighteningly reminiscent of modern television. William Holden gives an incredible performance as a producer who sees to what ludicrous extents the network has gone, but is unable to stop it. Frankly, mainstream society's willingness to swallow the sensationalism the network feeds them is more powerful than anything he can do. And therefore, he must sit back and watch it happen. Peter Finch gives an excitable performance as well as an anchorman who has been driven to a mental breakdown, and then becomes the voice of the masses. Faye Dunaway, usually a terribly stagey and unrealistic actress, actually tags her role for once, for which I give credit most to the screenwriter for fleshing out such a solid female character (not always so available). Robert Duvall is strong in his role as a power-hungry executive. And Ned Beatty, proving that he is capable of magnificent acting, received an Oscar nomination simply upon one perfectly scripted and perfectly delivered monologue. In fact, when you break the script down, you find that for the most part, this film is just a series of precise, fine-tuned monologues. And there is nothing wrong with that.

What other year can boast a list of successes, both critical and box office, on the order of: \"Gone with the Wind,\" \"Love Affair,\" \"Dark Victory,\" \"Juarez,\" \"The Roaring Twenties,\" \"The Hunchback of Notre Dame,\" \"Babes in Arms,\" \"Beau Geste,\" \"Mr. Smith Goes to Washington,\" \"Union Pacific,\" \"Goodbye, Mr. Chips,\" \"Wuthering Heights,\" \"Drums Along the Mohawk,\" and on and on? And one of the greatest of these is still \"The Wizard of Oz,\" probably the best family film ever made some sixty years after it was released.This is a film where everything works. Most notably, there is the casting. With the possible exception of her \"Vicki Lester\" in \"A Star is Born,\" Judy Garland never had a better cinematic vehicle for her talents than right here. Even when one knows her history of personal and professional heartbreak, her Dorothy Gale can still make believers of us all, while simultaneously causing us to regret what might have been had Louis B. Mayer stayed out of the pharmaceutical business. Ray Bolger brings his usual effortless charm to his best-known role, the Scarecrow. Jack Haley, Sr. rarely had a better vehicle for his understated brand of humor than the Tin Man. And the great Bert Lahr can still elicit his share of belly-laughs as the Cowardly Lion. Frank Morgan brings his usual dithery charm to Professor Marvel/The Wizard. And, Finally, Margaret Hamilton can still elicit a good old-fashioned scare in the role that would make her immortal, the Wicked Witch of the West. Interestingly, in real life, everybody who knew her had only the nicest of things to say about her. A single mother at a time when such things were less common than they are now, she was, by all accounts, a loving Mom to her only child, journalist Hamilton Maserve.Now to the technical end of things. If Harold Arlen and Yip Harburg had written the score to \"Oz\" and nothing else, that alone would have put them among the immortals. A. Arnold \"Buddy\" Gillespie's special effects were state of the art for that age, and how they could have lost the Oscar to \"Suez\" is beyond me. Harold Rossen's camerawork makes it all come alive, like a dream come to life. But the biggest suprise is the director. Victor Fleming was best known as a dramatic director (\"The Virginian,\" \"Red Dust,\" \"Test Pilot\") whose one previous attempt at a musical, \"Reckless,\" with Jean Harlow, was a high-budget bomb. This, however, doesn't prepare one for his work on \"Oz,\" in which he captures the sense of fantasy, whimsey, and, yes, menace, in a way no other director probably could. He would win the Best Director Oscar that year, not for \"Oz\" but for \"Gone with the Wind.\"In short, \"Oz\" was, is, and always will be a delight, due both to its charming story and the dedicated team of professionals who made sure that \"dreams really do come true.\""}, {"rank": 223, "name": "The Wizard of Oz", "movie_year": "1939", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "This is one of the few all time classic movies.......FAR ahead of its time....the COLOR for a movie of 1939....is remarkable........This movie defies time and appeals to audiences of all ages...........Wonderful.....I can watch it over...and over.....with my children....and Grandchildren"}, {"rank": 223, "name": "The Wizard of Oz", "movie_year": "1939", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Combining what American film makers have always done best, musicals and fantasy, The Wizard of Oz permeates English-speaking culture.

Personally, my favorite of these five is \"Mr. Smith goes to Washington\". However, I do recognize the greatness of \"The wizard of Oz\" and I do consider to be the most charming and most original musical ever made in Hollywood. During a local storm in Kansas, Dorothy's (Judy Garland) house takes off into the air and crashes on the wicked witch of the east killing her automatically. When Dorothy gets up again after having lost conscious because of the storm, she realizes that she isn't in Kansas anymore and the movie is now in color. After looking around for a while, a fairy appears and goes to see Dorothy and when she asks where she is, the fairy tells her that she is in the land of Oz and that the only way for her to get home is by talking to the wizard of Oz. As they talk, Dorothy makes the acquaintance of the lovely people who live in Oz called the Munchkins. But she is wearing a pair of red slippers which she doesn't know were the ones of the wicked witch of the east. So the witch's sister, the wicked witch of the west (Margaret Hamilton), appears before Dorothy asking her for the slippers. But the fairy defends Dorothy and the witch leaves. Dorothy then asks how to get to wizard's home. And this is when the fairy tells her that all she has to do is: \"Follow the yellow brick-road\". Along her way, Dorothy meets a scarecrow who doesn't scare crows anymore and doesn't have a brain, a tin-man who is too rusty to be able to even slightly move and has no heart and therefore no emotions, and finally, a lion who has lost all his courage. She invites the three with her to see the wizard suggesting that the wizard could give the scarecrow a brain, the tin-man a heart, the lion courage and tell her how to get home. But naturally, the path that leads to the wizard is full of surprises all set up by the wicked witch of the west. Charming and amusing, \"The wizard of Oz\" is a very unique movie and has no flaws. The story is incredibly original, the script is good, the directing is great, and the performances are exceptional. But it's Margaret Hamilton and Judy Garland who are the best part of the whole movie. Hamilton is very good and very evil as the wicked witch of the west and Garland is excellent as Dorothy. The singing scenes are the best that have ever been directed and Garland's singing is simply the best there ever was. It isn't a surprise that she was ranked as the eight female legend of AFI.

I always wanted to go \"over the rainbow\" and have exciting adventures, what kid wouldn't? This movie grips you as a kid with its fantasy and remains in your mind as an adult. As an adult (or whatever ;)), I still love this movie. It's a great movie with good songs, neat-o characters, and that simple message that \"There's no place like home.\" From the beginning, the movie takes a hold on you and never lets go. It never stops moving until Dororthy gets back to Kansas and find out that \"it's only a dream.\" For me, the best movies are those you remember throughout your life, no matter where you are or what you're doing. Also, I think a good movie should keep your interest from beginning to end. For me, The Wizard of Oz succeeds at both of these. It makes you laugh, cry, all that stuff.

Oz is populated by a bunch of singing midgets called munchkins and they tell her to follow the yellow brick road where she meets a bunch of wacked-out characters that also sing and she has to fight off an evil witch and talking trees and flying monkeys so that she can see the great and powerful wizard (Timothy Leary) of Oz who can send her back to Kansas (cause it's so exciting there) via hot air balloon, but he fails so she clicks her ruby slippers together and wakes up. Just between you me and the wall I'd say Dorothy's been playing in the old mushroom patch again.

Frank Baum. The story, as everyone already knows, centers around young Dorothy (age indistinct in the film) and her search for \"home.\" During her wild adventure, she survives being carried by a tornado and dumped into a surrealistic place called Munchkinland. Here she meets both the Wicked Witch of the West and Glinda, the Good Witch of the North. Glinda, already knowing how Dorothy can return to Kansas, sends her on an arduous journey down the Yellow Brick Road, where she meets the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion.

For instance, did anyone else ever notice that Toto has left some wet spots on Dorothy's dress in the very beginning of the movie when she leans down in the road? For me, however, the greatest joy comes from the wonderfully rich writing (\"You clinking, clanking, colossal pile of coligenous junk!\") Listen carefully at Miss Gulch's threat to the Gales at the beginning of the movie (\"I'll bring a damn suit against your whole farm!\") Please set me straight if I am wrong.

The wizardry of Oz is a reminder that the effects should serve the story, and not the other way around.

No other film in my recollection has \"evolved\" with successive viewings like this has: from my first time seeing it on black & white t.v. in 1967 at age 5 (a REAL journey, much longer than a mere two hours!); the realization nearly ten years later that 80% of the picture is in C O L O R; up through a couple of years ago, watching it needlessly truncated on commercial t.v. on a non-Easter Friday night (when the two hours felt like 20 minutes, if that). So I was ready for the \"genuine\" widescreen, three-strip Technicolor movie-theatre experience.The result: well, it was like having known about \"the man behind the curtain\" but not accepting it until now. I'm old enough to see the poor continuity (the Tin Man's funnel-hat handle switches sides at least once), the primitive make-up, the once-magical backgrounds that are now clearly movie sets, that Dorothy had quite a rack for a twelve-year-old;-),and so on. And as for \"Munchkinland,\" we won't even GO THERE.But it doesn't matter. Oh, the COLORS: the burnt fuschia of the hourglass sand, the genuine ruby of Dorothy's slippers, the repulsive green of the Witch's skin versus the entire green spectrum in the Emerald City. And there's nothing like seeing it with an adult audience: old enough to know all the lines and all the lyrics, booing and clapping and cheering right on cue (and laughing heartily where we never dared laugh before).

The tale of three G.I.'s returning to their hometown after serving in WWII. Each must adapt to their new lives which have been forever altered by their war time experience. The film is now over fifty years old but its story and message is just as new as when this film came out. Two of the three G.I.'s future seems somewhat secure. Frederic March as Al Stephenson an Army Sergeant returns to his family although a little changed due to the natural process of maturing regarding his children. He returns to his job in a bank and even though he is hitting the booze a little the viewer gets the feeling that he will settle down in time and because of his war experience will be a better man for it. Harold Russell himself a wounded veteran portrays Homer Parrish a Navy veteran who lost both hands during a sea battle. He will be provided for financially by a disability pension and even though his life will never be what it was before losing both hands the viewer also gets the feeling that he will make out in time. Then there is the Dana Andrews character Army Air Force Captain Fred Derry the only officer of the three. He was nothing more than an attendant at the local drug store soda fountain before his country called. He now returns to his hometown an Officer and a Gentleman and decorated war hero. Sadly that's about all he has going for him. This was the one character as I watched this film and thought `Now this guy would have been better off to have stayed in the service' Of course he probably for the purpose of the story had been forced out due to man power cutting. \n I found his plight the most interesting. He looks full of confidence and intelligence in his dress uniform but when he steps out of it and dons civilian attire he resembles nothing more than a down on his luck schmuck. Perhaps no other actor during the time this film was made could have pulled that off except Dana Andrews. He gives every indication that he will be come one of many WWII veterans who returned to their hometowns and found life boring and mundane compared to the 100% life living experience of being in the military during time of war. Eventually many would wind up hanging out at the local American Legion or VFW posts knocking back the booze and reliving perhaps for many literally the best years of their lives. The triple story line is handled very well with their paths crossing during the course of the film. Romance, marital woes even a brief questioning of America's involvement in WWII are also included in the picture.

All of the actors, even the big stars, were extremely adept at portraying ordinary people dealing with extraordinary circumstances.The scene where Myrna Loy's character explains, in front of her husband, the realities of marriage to her daughter is truly inspired and provides such powerful insight into these characters as individuals and as a family. I've yet to see another film from that time period that dares to cover that territory in such a realistic manner.Other favorite scenes: when Homer first returns home and his family and his girl are so overjoyed to see him that they don't even notice his missing hands, and then his mother speaks for all of them with her stifled sob once they finally notice. The scene where Fred, embittered by his job situation and his failed marriage, urges Homer to rush home and propose to Wilma immediately.

The effects seemed dated, and I was able to focus on the movie rather than just the gore/shock value.It was actually an extremely well made movie! The fact that this happens to an innocent 12yr old girl is excellent. It certainly would not have the same effect if it was a 30 old man. If you are religious, you will be undoubtedly sucked into believing the possibility that something like this could actually happen.To me that is the strength of this movie. While some things in this movie appear to be not credible I found myself still believing that it COULD HAPPEN. I kept saying to myself, \"How could this be happening?\" Yet it still seemed believable.While it didn't scare me the same way it did 20 years ago, it is still the best horror movie I've ever seen.

Not to mention all the supernatural stuff (shaking bed, wind in closed room, moving furniture, etc.).To experience this movie best, you should read up on some of the beliefs of the church, instances of possession, and what it all means.

We've been glued to our chairs or heckling callously at The Blair Witch Project, The Sixth Sense, Stigmata and others. As a prominent horror movie-maker once said, you never forget the guy who frightens you the first time. That guy can be Leatherface, Jason Vorhees, Freddy Kruger, Norman Bates, an exceptionally large flock of birds in the air, a coven of next-door neighbors in cahoots with a devil-worshiping obstetrician, Guy Woodhouse, Jack Torrance, Henry the Serial Killer ... or Regan MacNeil.\nIt's odd to think that, with all the suspense and horror movies we've experienced in the past 30 years -- all the serial murderers, the abusing husbands, the ghosts, the obsessive \"other\" women, the evil nannies and dentists and that Chucky doll that never seems to be properly destroyed -- the experience that tends to put America on edge the most is that of traditional good versus evil. Sure, you can surmise that running from a bunch of crazed slaughterhouse-types wanting to eat you and use your bones as chair legs and your skin as furniture upholstery is something like battling evil. But let's be honest. How does it compare to the look of despair on a mother's face as she sees the one thing she couldn't have realistically imagined: an exorcist coming to drive a demon out of her daughter?\nOK, it's a dramatic description ... and far-fetched at that. But watching William Peter Blatty's The Exorcist -- or reading the novel, for that matter -- slowly but mercilessly brings you to that strange sense of dread and hope when that exorcist finally approaches the door and ignores the screaming of the demon upstairs. By then, you're as cold as the scene appears. Somewhere deep inside, your breath is as white as the breath in Regan's bedroom.\nThe Exorcist marries crafty editing, intelligent storytelling and gripping detail into a single, beautifully told tale of demonic possession and the slow, eventual path toward understanding the need to drive the demon away. With superb acting, notably from Ellen Burstyn, Jason Miller and Linda Blair, all Oscar nominees for this movie, and a still-exceptional series of special, realistic effects, The Exorcist doesn't make promises to scare you. It makes no pretense at all. It just lets the macabre story unfold in front of you. Sure, a lot of people with today's multi-million-dollar special effects sensibilities will laugh off specific details. But what movie today is going to require you to sit through such hellish situations as stabbing-like female masturbation with a crucifix or through such profanity? We don't stomach things like we used to. Perhaps The Exorcist was before its time, but where would we be today without it?\nBefore you judge a movie, remember its conventions and understand its message. And keep in mind that this movie isn't trying to make you like it or continue watching it. Its seamlessness is based on one simple notion: the story goes on, whether you accept it or not.

Brody sees the outline of the mouth and the eye. And he should know what a shark looks like. But when he passes it around, Harry saysSeaweed?\" Verna Fields says, \"it's under water isn't it? That's why it's so dark?\" They can't see something that is so obviously and that is bothersome. That is how I feel about my reaction to the Exorcist. Everyone has told me how frightening it is and how it is a psychological trip. And I know the reaction that audiences had towards it in the 70's. But as much as I try, I just can't see it. It is not a scary movie and it is not even an enjoyable one, and I would even go so far as to say that it is not even a good movie.First off, there are so many parts of this film that have nothing to do with what the film is about. The first hour is nothing. It really has no relevance to the rest of the film. And for the life of me I really can't understand what the beginning is about. Why do we need the background of the Exorcist in Iraq? What does that have to do with the film and how does it further the plot? I don't get it.Secondly, this is a very poorly editted film. There were times that I cringed at some of the editting. It was such a blatant cut that you felt like you could see the editors crazy gluing the film together. And I am not saying that to be cruel, I really mean that.Thirdly, and this is the big one, what is so scary about this film? Really, all Regan did was get her face scarred a bit, vomit a lot, yell out obsenities and blugeon herself with a cross. Now that is interesting in the fact that this must have sent a shock wave through the religious community because you are not supposed to say or do anything bad towards the church. But in terms of scares or chills? No way, they just weren't there. I can admire a film like Halloween and Blair Witch for being innovative enough to scare us but no this film. Frankly, I was bored. I really was. There were times that I wanted to turn this off and watch the baseball game, and we all know how boring baseball is on the tube. But this film moved at a snails pace. And if they would have cut it down by about thirty minutes, it may have been better.The other element that I can't get past is the fact that this was the devil himself. Okay, let's just say it is. Why does it allow himself to be tied down? Why does it jump at water that isn't holy? Why does it possess a girl when it can come onto this Earth in human form if it wanted to. When Lucifer was kicked out of Heaven, he was abolished because of greed and a lust for power. So for an angel to be that despised must have been considered dangerous and powerful. If that is so, then why all the scenes of Satan being dominated by humans? Are you saying that the best he could come up with is making a girl puke, levitate, and throw a few things around the room? That sounds more like he was just having a bad day because he couldn't get his own way. That doesn't sound like the personification of evil. You want to see real evil, watch DeNiro in Angel Heart.The Exorcist is a film that has it's place in history and I can admire it for that. And to be honest I almost feel like someone that doesn't like The Blair Witch Project. I can't understand why people can't like that film, that is true fear for me. So when I say that this film is really not that good, I can understand why people may think I'm ignorant, but when you compare this to A Nightmare On Elm Street or Halloween, can you honestly say that this has more to offer?

The documentary was excellent, and I finally got to see the notorious \"spiderwalk\" scene that was cut out. I wanted to see this part for a long time, ever since I heard about it, but I didn't think I'd get to because I don't have a DVD player.

If \"The Exorcist\" is in some moments dramatic, in others violent, \"Hellraiser\" is a psychological thriller with almost unbearable cruelty ,and as Friedkin, Barker also could count with a terrific cast, beginning with the great and talented english actress Clare Higgins. Good part of \"The Exorcist\" quality resides in the cast's dramatic and true actings (to begin with young Linda Blair,who was nominated by the Academy for her role) and to the great special effects, that even have been done through simple and old techniques, surprise and help to show the exorcism's scenes in a faithful and raw form.\"The Exorcist\" is not a film recommended for sensitive people.

Friedkin's ground breaking approach to music and sound effects also contribute to it's power.Perhaps the most unsettling image I can think of, in ANY movie, is the close up of Regan after the head turning sequence in the exorcism.

Friedkin's film presents modern opinions and attitudes about possession: the psychologists and neurologists looking for brain lesions; the liberal priest who doubts possession and fears making the Church look anachronistic by entertaining the notion; the old-school priest who still thinks in Latin and has experienced Satan's reality and his ability to destroy lives.Linda Blair plays Regan, the twelve-year-old daughter of a popular actress, played by Ellen Burstyn. Regan likes to play with a Ouija board, and before she knows it, she's attracted the attention of a spirit named \"Captain Howdy.\" Catholic demonologists call this first phase of possession Obsession. As Regan becomes more intimate with the spirit, It becomes bolder, upsetting her emotionally and kinesthetically acting out. This is called Manifestation, if memory serves (I studied for the priesthood, but dropped out). Finally, Captain Howdy takes control and soon we have Linda Blair at her projectile-vomiting best. Full-fledged Possession! Burstyn goes to the Catholic Church, thinking they can help, and meets a young priest named Father Kinderman (Lee Cobb). Together they try to get Regan help, and in the end decide to exorcise her after conventional means fail. The Exorcist (Max Von Sydow) comes and starts the exorcism. From there, it's a terrifying ride.This movie scares you, disturbs you, and grosses you out. However, the characters are well-developed, the dialogue is terriffic, and the special effects and make-up never go over the top. Even though the little girl floats and her head goes around 360 degrees, you never lose the willing suspension of disbelief. You might, however, lose your lunch.I suggest this movie to everyone, but to Catholics in particular. The mystical bureaucracy of the Church is depicted quite accurately with no hyperbole or cynical Catholic bashing. Not to be seen by children you wish to keep emotionally healthy.

The psychological games between Karras and the demon are beautifully insinuated and even with minimal screen time, Karras' mother is used to torment the ailing priest in an exceptional scene.

The story is very simple: in present-day Washington D. C. an 11-year-old girl is possessed by an entity that claims to be the devil himself. When her atheist mother exhausts all medical possibilities, she turns in desperation to a Jesuit priest.The first thing that ages in films is the special effects, but in this example some have aged faster than others. The sight of the girl, Regan, being thrown around her bed by invisible forces made some other people in the audience laugh, but the make-up effects, such as the afore-mentioned projectile vomiting and a genuinely shocking scene involving a crucifix, are as fresh now as they were then. The film is also too long, with endless shots of nothing happening deflating the tension that has been built up so painstakingly. The direction itself is assured to the degree of virtuosity (Friedkin had just won an Oscar), and the script is true to its source novel, since the same person wrote them. The finest performance of the film comes from Miller, brilliant as the anguished priest of faltering faith who finds new purpose in saving the soul of the young girl. Blair is also impressive, although the \"Voice of the Demon\" is provided by one Mercedes McCambridge, having to act in such an entirely evil way would certainly have an effect on an ordinary prepubescent, but she handles it all with enormous talent, properly earning her Oscar nomination.On the whole though, the whole thing is somewhat unsatisfactory. I didn't find it at all scary, though occasionally thrilling, but my fatal error was reading up about the film before seeing it, as knowing the intricacies of how the subtexts and directorial tricks all work detracted from the film itself.

Most people were genuinely terrified, but a lot of people LAUGHED at it.First of all, this deserves the title of classic for the same reason King Kong (1933) is a classic: Nothing even remotely like it had been done before. Even those people who weren't scared by it, have to acknowledge that fact. Laugh all you want at the cheesiness of King Kong today, but rest assured women really DID faint at its premiere. Same with The Exorcist. Second, the film especially terrified those of us who had a Catholic upbringing. Blatty was able to reach into the deepest recesses of our fears, and pull out the....for want of a better word, \"gothicness\" of the Roman faith and shove it in our faces. Third, the Exorcist terrified on a completely different level than most other horror films. You can sleep tight KNOWING that Freddy Krueger is a Hollywood invention, along with Jason, etc. Do you know the devil isn't real? Today I am an atheist, and don't believe in the devil, yet I can still appreciate what the director was hinting at, and what buttons he was trying to push.I challenge anyone to name a more viscerally terrifying movie than the Exorcist."}, {"rank": 226, "name": "The Exorcist", "movie_year": "1973", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Excellent adaptation of Blatty's superb novel by director William Friedkin. The more I watch it, the more scared I become. The beginning of the film may drag for some, but it is an important element to the story, so try and stay tuned. The cast is awesome. Burstyn is flawless as the mother constantly in peril. Miller, Von Sydow and legend Lee J. Cobb are also in top form. Blair is menacing, but it is the voice of Mercedes McCambridge that adds the horror. The special effects send constant chills up your spine throughout the entire picture.

The first time six years ago when I was sixteen years old. I had nightmares for a week. I had only heard that it was scary and didn't know anything else about it (being Swedish, I of course knew that Max von Sydow had a part in it), so it *did* scare me. It isn't scary in the special effects 'body-parts are flying'-kind of way or anything, it's scary on a psychological level which is a thing I don't think people who say that this isn't a scary movie can see. They obviously wants more blood and maimed bodies. This is horror with *class*. More of a Silence of the Lambs-\"scariness\".However, I have now seen it a second time and I have to say that I don't find it as scary as I did when I was sixteen. But it is still a great movie and didn't William Peter Blatty say that he based his book on an article he had read as a student about an exorcism that the Catholic church *had* allowed for a young boy. I don't know if that's true, but if the Catholic church allows an exorcism then it must be... serious.Great and intense movie. I give it 7/10."}, {"rank": 226, "name": "The Exorcist", "movie_year": "1973", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Allegedly the scariest film ever made, this head-turning, projectile-vomiting extravaganza got another outing in British cinemas to celebrate its 25th year. The story is very simple: in present-day Washington D. C. an 11-year-old girl is possessed by an entity that claims to be the devil himself. When her atheist mother exhausts all medical possibilities, she turns in desperation to a Jesuit priest.The first thing that ages in films is the special effects, but in this example some have aged faster than others. The sight of the girl, Regan, being thrown around her bed by invisible forces made some other people in the audience laugh, but the make-up effects, such as the afore-mentioned projectile vomiting and a genuinely shocking scene involving a crucifix, are as fresh now as they were then. The film is also too long, with endless shots of nothing happening deflating the tension that has been built up so painstakingly. The direction itself is assured to the degree of virtuosity (Friedkin had just won an Oscar), and the script is true to its source novel, since the same person wrote them. The finest performance of the film comes from Miller, brilliant as the anguished priest of faltering faith who finds new purpose in saving the soul of the young girl. Blair is also impressive, although the \"Voice of the Demon\" is provided by one Mercedes McCambridge, having to act in such an entirely evil way would certainly have an effect on an ordinary prepubescent, but she handles it all with enormous talent, properly earning her Oscar nomination.On the whole though, the whole thing is somewhat unsatisfactory. I didn't find it at all scary, though occasionally thrilling, but my fatal error was reading up about the film before seeing it. Despite the fact that the text I read (BFI Modern Classics- The Exorcist by Mark Kermode) was very good, knowing the intricacies of how the subtexts and directorial tricks all work did detract from the film itself.

I detest so-called horror films that teach the maxim of scariness being how often someone can really get you by jumping out from the closet and saying, \"Boo!\" Horror is a reaction, it's a mood, it's a feeling. Horror is looking at Raegan and saying, \"That's Evil!\" Horror is watching Rosemary of \"Rosemary's Baby\" realize what really has been going on with her neighbors, and just what it is they want of her. But to bring all this back to \"The Exorcist\", the truly horrific parts of the show are only two seconds long! For the most part, the viewer is stuck watching boring characters who have no flair, no substance, and no interesting qualities. And what of the scenes that end with poor exorcists dodging flying furniture and then never bother to tell you how the priest got out of such a situation? I do apologize, but this film is heinous. It's heinous, dull, and I really am mystified by all the attention people have given it.Best horror film of all time? Gimme a break.

Then after awhile, she becomes looking almost like a demon. Her mother, enlists the help of a young priest, who tries to talk to Regan (Blair) and get the demon out of her.

The pea-soup regurgitation scene is the best, and has become a memorable and famous scene, of the whole horror genre.

Everyone else in the film, also does a great job.

The old movies in the 30s, 40s, and 50s were scary in the traditional sense. They were creepy and played off of traditional human emotions and storylines (good and evil, love and death, guilt and redemption). But then a movie named Psycho came out and suddenly it was no longer enough to make a creepy movie about an evil monster. Now you had to make a shocker about pathological crimes and sexual repression. \"Halloween\" continued this tradition of serial killer shockers, and it in turn led to the \"Fridays,\" \"Nightmares,\" \"Screams,\" etc. What happened is that people thought that the only real scare was one involving a surprise. There isn't a single scary moment in any of those films, in the sense that the audience doesn't have a sense of terror that lasts past the moment that the image is on the screen. The only thing they offer is a set-up, release, and surprise formula that is now so much of a cliche that I think the entire genre needs to be eliminated. How often do we see the naked girl walking around in the dark, just to be startled by the cat, and then to get her head cut off just after the \"scary\" music stops? That is not a horror movie. It is a stupid little child yelling \"Boo\" at the top of his lungs.The Exorcist is a scary movie and a horror movie. It is about the three most horrific of all inherently human topics--the existence of a benevolent God, death, and human weakness. We see intense, pained people struggling with these topics. And we see a world of ever-increasing evil and moral decay. The character of Karras alone could warrant an entire discussion. And how about the subliminal shots? I don't know if I have ever seen anything as scary--or as inherently cinematic--as those demonic subliminal shots in the middle of scenes that were already upsetting.Despite for some weak (not boring, but unnatural) dialogue in the first hour, a masterpiece of filmmaking and storytelling..."}, {"rank": 226, "name": "The Exorcist", "movie_year": "1973", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "A horror film with subtext.

The whole cinema was in fits of laughter throughout. Well how would you react to a deep-voiced 12 year old girl swearing to a couple of priests, a head twisting round and what the hell was she doing with her tongue.

It does have flaws: the opening sequence in Iraq, although beautiful to look at, is ultimately superfluous (although it obviously inspires the similar setting at the beginning of 'The Omen', which is used with much greater relevance); the pacing is very uneven and the young priest couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. It makes up for its shortcomings with a superb performance from Ellen Burstyn as the mother and an unparalleled performance from Linda Blair as the girl. The final scenes of the exorcism are some of the most powerful ever put onto film (and MUST BE VIEWED ON A BIG SCREEN to appreciate their full impact). The film is harrowing rather than scary, with repeated visits into the girl's bedroom becoming just as full of dread for the audience as for the characters. The demon-possessed Linda Blair is one of the most memorable icons in cinema history. Still banned on video in the UK (mainly because of how young Linda Blair is than for any other reason), this is the only example of censorship of a mainstream film that I support. See the film and, for goodness sake, watch it with your disbelief suspended (sorry if this is stating the obvious, but there were people around me in the cinema laughing at various scenes when there is NOTHING REMOTELY FUNNY about what goes on).

The film has its moments of \"boo!\" The vomit shot or the head turning, but what you really remember from the film is the sound and the imagery. Early in the film when Father Merrin visits a temple in Iraq, he confronts the statue of a demon. Below him are dogs fighting, as he stares into the statue the dogs sounds become distorted and grotesque. They don't sound like dogs anymore. The voice of the Devil haunts you for days after viewing the film. So full of malice and vulgarities, it would be comical if deep in your mind you could separate the voice from the face. Put them together, and you'll still be making sure your windows and doors are locked tightly. The final thing that follows you around is the ghost white face that appears in Father Karras' dream and in the exorcism of the Devil from Regan. It only appears for a second, but that face lingers with you. It is not grotesque, but it is evil. And it will haunt you, just watch the exorcism scene.

I think part of the problem is this film is being compared to movies today. Most films released in the 1990s are fast-paced because attention spans are much shorter than they were 20-30 years ago. Blame it on all of us under 35 being brought up in the TV generation. This film slowly brings the viewer to the realization that the little girl is possessed, that Father Karras (misspelled maybe?) is haunted by his own demons, and that the world around the family is so skeptical that they can't or won't believe that a person can be possessed. The reason why the ending seems so explosive and haunting is because how it is set up.If you want some explanation about the film, see the 25 Anniversary edition. Prior to the film, there is BBC produced documentary about the film which shows outtakes and talks to everybody involved with the film. I will say I have seen this movie so many times that it doesn't scare me as it once did but when I saw the outtake of the Spider-Walk scene, I was truly scared again.One more thought, in 1973, when this film was released every denomination denounced the film, Billy Graham did a sermon on the evils of this film, and there were religious protestors outside theaters.

The effects were very well done, and the movie was quite scary in places (more so than silly slasher flicks like \"Friday the 13th\", anyway), but the plot and character development left much to be desired. Ellen Burstyn's character, the mother of the possessed girl, is one-dimensional at best, and is frequently very annoying, while Max von Sydow's Father Merrin seems almost totally undeveloped despite spending a fair amount of time on the screen. The only human character with any interesting development at all is Jason Miller's Father Karras. The most important character, though, and the one whose development is perhaps most lacking, is the Devil himself. He possesses this little girl, and does all sorts of disgusting and violent things with her, but his motives in doing so are totally unexplained. In this regard, the climax of the film also seems terribly silly. Frankly, if the sort of stuff shown in this film is the best that the Devil can do, I wouldn't be too terribly scared of him.Overall Rating: 5 (out of 10), or 2 stars (out of 4)"}, {"rank": 226, "name": "The Exorcist", "movie_year": "1973", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "How did the director and the other folks involved with making this film, get away with releasing The Exorcist in 1973?

Now I comprehended the evolution of Phil like never before, the whole thing about how he grew up as a man (and therefore got the girl- though that's not even the most important part) when he begins to care for others. It's more than just taking care of himself by learning the piano or sculpting, he really gets to grow and improve as a human being when he begins to care for others, all others, needle head Ned included. Even the girl (Andy McD.) doesn't care for needle head Ned, but Phil does, he buys all the insurance from him. The old ladies, the old man and even Larry (pastry Larry). It reminds me of this coworker I have who is hated by everybody, and whenever I am nice to her it makes me feel better than usual because to care for her is more difficult than to care for a nice person.

I usually come away from them with a sense of an opportunity missed, due to sloppy execution or lack of imagination. The screenplay of \"Groundhog Day\" is outstanding, in that its creators evidently gave much thought to answering the question: if a person found himself inescapably, eternally repeating the same day in his life, just what _would_ he do? The execution of this 'thought experiment' is so thorough that it passes beyond hilarity, beyond cleverness -- though the film has both qualities in abundance -- to reach a level of psychological, even spiritual profundity that puts Groundhog Day in league with the very best examples of its type, \"It's a Wonderful Life\" and \"A Christmas Carol\". All this from a Bill Murray comedy -- who would have thought! (\"Scrooged\", Bill's own version of the \"Christmas Carol\" story, wilts in comparison.)

I have my doubts whether there are enough minutes in the day to do all the good deeds that Phil did on that one day.We are never really told what caused Phil to have to repeat the same day over and over.

He doesn't get it right the first time, or perhaps for years. He does what any human would do in the situation. Early on, he uses his knowledge of that day to play God. Then, he uses it to have fun and get women. Then, he is filled with despair and tries to end it with his own death. Then, after trying every crass and immature thing he can think of, he finally realizes that he can actually enjoy his fate if he is reliving a great day, so he makes it so. He makes himself a better person, but the transformation happens only after many missteps ... exactly what would happen to anybody really caught in the situation.How many comedies do you know in which the lead character quotes Chekhov and recites French poetry?

It's rare that a film like this is considered both genuine and a good example of it's art but La Haine is both.The plotline is compelling and realistic and neatly shows the way that inner city life has gone in the big cities in France as well as proving that despite the romance of Paris, it suffers from the same problems as any other major city.The characters are above all believable and the cast did a great job. The quality of acting is simply stunning from several actors and it would be a shame if it was simply dismissed as \"just another foreign art-house movie\" by audiences outside France.Above all the film whilst showing the influences of American films and society has a very clear sense of it's own identity and at no time does it feel like another US Ghetto film transposed to France. This is a major boon to the film and it stands out of the crowd for this, even though many people will dislike it because of this.

Class struggle, gangs and the styles assumed by kids in Europe are not defined by the United States of America.One of the things that makes this film intriguing is the subtle uses of background props. Consider the Escher poster in the background in one of the scenes. This conveys a world turned upsidedown. Early in the film we hear Vinz mention that he feels isolated and insignificant as an ant floating out in the universe. Later we see the boys walking into the background while the camera keeps a poster of the World as seen from space in the foreground. This is an ingenious representation visually of the idea we heard expressed earlier.There is some irony in that Jodie Foster helped bring this film to fruition. We see Vinz acting out the role of DeNiro from Taxi Driver in front of a mirror one scene. This made me think of Jodie Foster's Army (a punk band from Phoenix) and Hinckly's assassination attempt on Reagan... are all these kids \"catcher in the rye\" types waiting for their chance to snap?

Worse, in spite of the unmitigated suffering, everything has a squeaky-clean gloss, and the Joads are suffused with an unrelenting nobility that makes you want to strangle them all. Certainly Steinbeck's \"little people\" were heavily romanticized, but you could still taste the Demon Dust that engulfed them. Here it too often feels like a little wayward talcum powder.Fonda's Tom Joad is especially troubling, because he seems to exist as the mediating force between \"our\" prejudices about these people and their essential \"goodness\". He's clearly capable of violence -- and of realizing our worst fears about the poor and aimless -- but his faults are the result of an involuntary fall from grace. He's at the core an angel who's been cast from heaven by evil forces outside himself. This is rather simplistic.Still, if the film ended on Fonda's famed visionary, fevered soliloquy, it would be easy to forgive much of the gloss.

Full of sadness, hope, innocence, and despair, it is an emotionally evocative portrait of the life of an Indian family, their trials, and their courage and persistence throughout. They go on, not because they are exceptional, but because they must, because they are human.Ray does a masterful job of capturing the simple joys of childhood, and the ambitions and dreams which make us all human, regardless of where we are. Simple scenes such as a disfigured elderly woman seated on a porch, singing of her approaching death, are very moving. I have never seen the basic elements of life treated with such an incisive yet soft touch as Ray has in this film. It is wonderful to watch in comparison to the broad writing strokes and vulgar generalities of most directing and writing today.

The story centers around an wealthy English man who is suicidal and gloomy after the death of his wife. This role is carried out brilliantly by Laurence Olivier. He meets and falls in love with a young and very naive girl he meets in Monte Carlo. He marries her and brings her back to his boyhood home, called Manderley. This is when the trouble begins. The wife, played wonderfully by Joan Fontaine, is ill at ease as a mistress of the house and is intimidated and frightened at the idea of the first wife, Rebecca, haunting the house and the idea that she does not measure up to Rebecca, who was charming and beautiful to all who knew her. Rebecca allegedly died in a sailing accident, and when the wreck of her boat is found near the estate, all the past rises up again to destroy Maxim and his bride. Films like these are no longer made, which is why they are called classic.

It's an excellent mystery movie! Everything about this movie shines, beginning with the story itself. I really liked the story, in which the title character is a dead woman whose \"presence\" still lingers in many ways. The plot takes quite an unexpected turn near the end of the movie, when a shocking revelation is made. This revelation has a significant effect on the main characters. Speaking of characters, the performances of all the actors are outstanding. I loved Joan Fontaine's performance in this movie. It is one of the greatest female performances. What I liked about her performance most is that she plays a very shy woman. That's not something you see very often in movies. Fontaine plays her character with a lot of realism. She gets married to a wealthy widower, without having any knowledge of the lifestyle that awaits her. You can't help but be moved by her character's innocence and her desire to do the \"right\" thing, despite her timidness. You can understand the reasons for her character's confusion in being \"the second wife\", and her feelings of isolation when she is inevitably compared to the late Rebecca. Another really good performance is that of Judith Anderson as the sinister housekeeper, Mrs. Danvers. I especially liked the bedroom window scene where Anderson is telling the depressed Fontaine what she ought to do with her life. I love the expression on Fontaine's face in that scene. Also, Laurence Olivier gives a great performance as the husband, who has ambivalent feelings toward Fontaine. Furthermore, the sets were amazing.

I, however, have changed, and see things in \"Cool Hand Luke\" that I hadn't noticed before.What really stands out are the allusions to Jesus Christ. Ol' Luke, the decorated war veteran who never rose above the rank of private and is now serving a two year sentence on a Southern chain gang, is apparently meant by director Stuart Rosenberg to be a Christ figure. After the contest in which Luke downs 50 hard-boiled eggs, he is photographed lying on his back on the table, his legs outstretched and legs crossed in such a way as to suggest the way Jesus is depicted on the crucifix. Later, Luke moans his way through the song \"Plastic Jesus\" while accompanying himself on the banjo. At the end, the photo of Luke with two beautiful women that his fellow cons ripped in half after learning it was a fake, is shown taped back together and superimposed over an intersection in the road--a cross. I assume that the repaired photo is meant to suggest a resurrection in the sense that the cons believe in him once more. \"Luke is detached and indifferent,\" Paul Newman is quoted as saying on the back cover of the video, \"but he can't beat the system he scoffs at.\" Perhaps the religious symbolism in the film is meant to suggest that Luke, though providing his fellow cons with a vicarious taste of freedom through his repeated escapes, is no savior at all. He is merely a \"plastic Jesus\" just like the one in the song.Whatever the imagery is meant to suggest, \"Cool Hand Luke\" remains an excellent and thoroughly satisfying film. Paul Newman's performance is one of his best, and the rest of the cast (including such then obscure actors like Wayne Rogers, Ralph Waite, Dennis Hopper, and Harry Dean Stanton) is excellent.

The portrayal of that increasingly-scarce commodity, genuine innocence, is so finely played by the first-class cast that one can only marvel at how well they pull it off. This was a role that could have been made for showcasing the talents of Julie Andrews, and like most peak-of-career performances it is impossible to imagine anyone else in the part.The music of Rodgers and Hammerstein has been condemned for being below the standards of their contemporaries (Gershwins, Berlin, Bernstein et al), and although that is arguable, it is also incontrovertible that the majority of their musical offerings have withstood the test of time for the sheer rightness of time and place of the songs that assist the dramatic flow rather than stopping it in its tracks. And their innate 'hummability' continues to sustain both the amateur and professional musical theatre in countless revivals. Most modern musicals consistently fail to attract widespread support because while the writing may be more 'clever' in an often self-indulgent way, they lack the memorability of a single simple tune.I have just watched this film again with my daughters, 10 and 7, and while they have been unavoidably exposed to some of the harshness and cynicism of the 90's I was pleased to see that they accepted and enjoyed the film for what it is, an honest, highly agreeable telling of a story in words and music, that speaks of essential goodness amidst both bright and dark moments.

Julie Andrews is wonderful (what I wouldn't give for a voice like that!) as Maria von Trapp, and the kids do a good job, although some of their dialogue seems a bit forced. Charmain Carr, as Liesl, was perhaps my least favorite part of the film. Surely a more talented actress could have been found for the role. All in all, though, the acting is good. The songs are pleasantly hummable; no, this isn't the most brillant music in the world, but not everything has to be a masterpiece to be enjoyable. \"Edelweiss\" is my personal favorite.

Every time I knuckle down and actually see this movie again, however, I am struck by how honest and *truly* sweet it is--there is nothing sickening or overly sentimental about it (aside from the dreadful \"Sixteen Going On Seventeen\", which I always fast-forward through on the tape).The acting is wonderful. Julie Andrews actually seems to allow the audience to read her mind several times during the film, such as in the delightful \"Edelweiss\" scene. Christopher Plummer is also very good as a man who is extremely confident in his old love (for his country) while at the same time being insecure in his growing new one (for Maria). The children are genuine and endearing without being cutesy, and the serious plot turn, involving the escape from the Nazis, is handled very well. Yes, I know this is not how it happened in real life, but it does play well on screen. Most (if not all) \"true story\" movies take dramatic liberties, and as long as the viewer realizes this fact, everything is fine.In conclusion, my advice to anyone who hasn't seen this movie in a while is to see it again (on video, not TV--the network cuts too much out) and realize how genuine and non-syrupy it actually is. It is well-filmed, well-acted, and it contains some of the best music Rodgers and Hammerstein ever wrote (although I will admit I'm not too fond of Rodgers's addition, \"Something Good\").

Rodgers was never much of a musician. His spectacular box-office success makes little sense when you consider that his contemporaries included (at different times) George Gershwin, Kurt Weill and Leonard Bernstein - all composers who could blow him out of the water and who all, incidentally, wrote better songs. Rodgers and Hammerstein specialised in middlebrow inoffensiveness. But every so often they would leave this realm and enter that of the positively bad: `Surrey with a Fringe on Top', `A Gal Who Can't Say No', `Clam Bake', `I'm Gonna to Wash that Man Right out of My Hair' and `State Fair' are all songs with a pungent stink.`The Sound of Music' is their best work. It never stinks, it's heartfelt, and at any rate it avoids the air of calculated innovation and phoney bigness that pervades most of their other musicals. And this is a glorious transfer to the screen, it really is. (Note that Robert Wise was also responsible for the screen version of `West Side Story'.) Its weaknesses stem from weaknesses in the original. For instance:Too many songs occur in performances for the benefit of other characters - it's the old let's-put-on-a-show problem. By the end of `Lonely Goatherd' we are fidgeting and wondering when we'll ever be done with the impromptu theatrical productions, and if the story will ever be allowed to proceed. The lyrics for `Something Good' were written by Rodgers himself and they demonstrate that Hammerstein's job was much harder than it looked. `So Long, Farewell' is just too slight in every way to be worth staging - and it's staged TWICE, no less. And some dialogue that might work on stage plays cheezily on the screen.On the other hand, the Rodgers and Hammerstein style for once truly suits its subject. Many of the songs are children's songs, nursery songs (`My Favourite Things'), beginner's songs (`Do Re Me'), or simple patriotic folksongs (`Edelweiss'). Even more musically sophisticated things like the title song come off well. Yes, this musical isn't at all innovative, but then Rodgers was never GOOD at innovation - that kind of thing was better left to Gerwshin, Weill, Bernstein, et al.It's a pity that `The Sound of Music' is the only `epic' musical that many people see - `West Side Story' and `Fiddler on the Roof' are better examples of the genre, and at any rate give a more balanced view of what it's capable of. But I must side with those who say that it's nonetheless a great movie. The script is (mostly) sharp, the languid direction is appropriate and engrossing, and it simply LOOKS good.

It simply has everything one could want in a movie. First of all, it has a REAL romance - one where you can watch the characters slowly fall in love. It's not like today's movies where two characters meet and the next scene is them waking up together. Secondly, it has humor. Not syrupy or corny humor, but very wry, dry tongue-in-cheek humor. For evidence, look at the quotes. Baronness Schraeder is especially well-done in this regard. Her comments simply drip with ice. \"Good bye, Maria. I'm sure you'll make a fine nun.\" You want to smack her. Thirdly, it's got adventure. The Nazis are the ultimate villains in any movie - WWII was as clear a case of good vs. evil as you can find, making it great fodder for films - and so it's great to see Maria, the Captain and the kids outwit them. Fourthly, it's got great music. Fifthy, it's got great scenery. And the plot and dialogue are astounding. I find new things to admire each time I watch. Finally, is there a greater scene in any movie than the nuns revealing the stolen Nazi car parts??? \"The Sound of Music\" does not just succeed because it cheers people up with syrup or song.

First, the good news. Director Robert Wise, who's had an awesome career, is in top form: the movie is very well made and looks terrific throughout. The opening sequence is truly wonderful, with the beautiful Julie Andrews singing at 10,000' without gasping for breath. Christopher Plummer is good.Much of the music is good. My favorite numbers are \"Do, Re, Mi\" and \"The Lonely Goatherd.\" Both are staged very well and are extremely hummable. Here's a fantasy of mine for \"Do, Re, Mi.\" Part of the number is done along a road with a white fence. The fence has five horizontal rails, which reminded me of the staff on sheet music. The kids should have been positioned on the fence like notes on the sheet music, matching what was being sung. But they didn't do that.The wedding is impressively staged.But you come inevitably to the flaws, mostly ones of sentimentality. The song \"So Long, Farewell\" is awful. And its staging is bad. At the end, when all the dinner guests wave good-night to the kids, I want to throw up. \"Maria,\" though tuneful, is a dumb song.There are soft spots in the cast. Eleanor Parker as the baroness is stagy. Charmian Carr as Liesl is stagy, and particularly bad in the dialogue leading up to \"You are Sixteen\" at the gazebo. She had a deservedly brief film career, making only one other movie, and it was for TV.Let's not forget the plot. This pretends to be a true story. But ... the von Trapps did not flee Austria one step ahead of the Nazis, climbing all those mountains (with the grass waving due to the helicopter carrying the camera) -- they just left. So all that stuff after the music festival is fiction. I believe, but I'm not sure, that the Nazis did not try to force Capt. von Trapp back into the armed forces, either.As good as Julie Andrews is (and I'm a big fan), there are some awkward moments. After she runs back to the convent in the beginning, she runs past this group of nuns, and does a lousy double-take when she's caught. Then she gives a bad speech about how nice it was in the country, \"... and the sky was so blue ...\" It rings hollow.

That was some time ago, and then I didn't really appreciate the real beauty of Music--understandable, I suppose, since some kid kept kicking my seat and yelling \"Where's the beef?\" But the movie is so well-known and revered all over the world, it's become a basic cinematic staple. In Salsburg, tours feature landmarks made famous in the movie. You can buy music boxes in any souvenier store that play \"Eidelweiss.\" They're still nuts about Music over there. And in a way, I suppose everyone is. The movie is a double romance. The obvious one is between Maria and the Captain. The other, just as powerful, is the love of music. The only character I really didn't like was Liesel--pretty as she was, she seemed a textbook musical actress--fake and perfectly rehearsed. But the famous gazebo scene with Maria and the Captain is still my favorite, as is their lovely dance at the party.

That wonderful scherzando \"toy piano\"-sound version of Favorite Things as the family teem out of the Von Trapp estate's gates. Such a shame there were never enough good projects for Julie Andrews. I remember when she used to appear on shows after TSOM and sort of tried to shrug it off like a ghost, and yet it has turned out to be the defining performance of her career, and rightfully so. She has such a deft touch with humor, in fact that is one of the aspects of TSOM people overlook, in many areas it is done with great lightness-of-touch. As noted by others: Richard Haydn's \"Heil Hitler\" and countless others. And the scene in the Abbey graveyard with the torches is made truly eerie, especially on wide screen as the torch beams play and the shadows deepen and the Trapps huddle. In my opinion it is these little \"homey\" touches (the runners-up at the Music Festival) of humor which make the whole so infectious.And the script is superb. \"You have to look for your life. You have to lead the life you were born to lead.\" plain and powerful. To \"Your face is all red\" in my favorite scene in the whole movie: The Landler sequence.

Also: `The Shop Around the Corner' (around the corner from WHERE?), `The Empire Strikes Back' (it doesn't), `The Living Daylights', `True Lies', `Batman Forever', `Species', `The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp' ... if anyone has any more suggestions, please send them to me.In this case, it happens over several nights, and I'm not sure which particular night is being referred to. Probably one of the candidate nights is less unobvious than the rest; so I guess the title isn't COMPLETELY mystifying. But actually, Capra gives us the feeling that everything is up in the air. Everyone knows that the hero and heroine of romantic comedies are bound to get hitched in the end - in most cases it's simply a question of staying awake. But Capra makes us feel the contingency of it all. I, for one, was convinced that right up until the final moment, it could have gone either way. How did Capra manage this? Was it because he was a complete innocent; or was it because he was remarkably sophisticated? I don't suppose it matters: it's results that count.I'm glad to see very little mention among the comments about the sexism of it all. The characters have life; their words have life; and if such art as this could only be produced by a sexist society, it's almost worth creating a sexist society (and then dismantling it), in order to get the art. In modern romances I get the feeling that the writers are wearily writing `feisty' lines for the heroine in an attempt to fool feminists, who, by and large, aren't so easily fooled. Claudette Colbert isn't feisty. When she DOES assert her independence, she means it.(And, of course, when Clark Gable asserts his dominance, HE means it. You don't get sincerity like this these days.)Anyway, the ideology of a film, if there is one, is always beside the point, except inasmuch as the ideology is AESTHETICALLY attractive or unattractive. This is an attractive film. Two real individuals, a real story, some misunderstanding but no tiresome or pointless misunderstanding, constant wit - and, as I expressed amazement at earlier, constant suspense.

Well.. it's good for a couple laughs, at least. I agree, though, with some of the other postings here that this isn't Capra's best work.

However, I really did enjoy some of the scenes in this classic. For example, the scene where Colbert manages to get a ride with Gable by lifting up her skirt to hitchhike. I also thought that the scenes where Gable undresses and tells Colbert that there aren't two men in the world who do it the same way and the scene where Gable explains to Colbert that dipping your doughnut is an art were brilliant. Overall, I think it might simply have been the idea of a reporter falling in love with a rich woman whose father does not appreciate her fianc\u00e9 that kind of made this movie, to my eyes, not quite as good as I expected. However, I must give credit to Gable and Colbert for their two very good and very strong performances as well as for Frank Capra's expert directing.

His mother and stepfather are portrayed as preoccupied and uncaring, and the schoolteachers are hostile, impatient and inept, but the kid himself is no angelic Oliver Twist. A lazy student, he plagiarizes his homework when he isn't cutting classes altogether, nearly burns down the family's apartment due to his thoughtlessness, and steals a typewriter out of his stepfather's office during one of his prolonged absences away from home. Amazingly, Truffaut manages to blend a great deal of charm and humor into this sad situation, and the city of Paris becomes practically another character.

The first time I saw it was on Bravo a few years back. The film felt so contemporary to me, that it shocked me to see it was made in 1959. Jean Pierre Leaud gives a devastating performance. Its strength lies in the fact that he's not playing a cute, lovable boy, but a true teenager. This might be the first time a director did not condescend to its child actors.

It is the defining film in Bergman's career (although I tend to vote Wild Strawberries as his best), although it received little commercial success in the US, not that many Bergman films do receive much commercial success in the US. The first thing one must remember before seeing Persona is the basic theme behind the film. This is a film that draws more on technique than plot. As properly put by a previous critic, Persona is to film what Ulysses is to literature. A correct analysis. Persona's plot seems simple enough: a famous actress loses the ability to speak and a nurse takes care of her. Simple plot- almost too simple for that is what Bergman intends. He made Persona as a statement towards art and film. The true identity of art and how it becomes our lives and encompasses all of what we are. Aestheticism. Persona is Bergman's description, and indictment, of aestheticism. Whatever talent as a filmmaker Bergman lacks (which is not much), he makes up for as a philosopher. Persona is art. Persona is the anti-art. Persona is a philosophy about itself and the world."}, {"rank": 245, "name": "Persona", "movie_year": "1966", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "It's hard to comment on a film like PERSONA without sounding like a philosophy teacher or a self-indulgent art-house nut. Some people have said the film is absolutely impossible to understand. I can relate to that, because PERSONA is not the kind of movie you rent for popcorn and beer purposes. It is usually seen in college film courses (where I saw it first) or by discerning filmgoers with a passion for foreign films. What I see in this truly haunting film is the definition of surrealistic cinema. Like Luis Bunuel and Salvador Dali's classic short UN CHIEN ANDALOU suggests, our eyes are about to see into a portion of the unconscious mind. This is not to say the scenes are not connected and have no point. There actually is a story here. Once you begin the visual journey Ingmar Bergman puts you on, there is no turning back.PERSONA is actually a love story. An actress goes mute seemingly because of the madness in society, or does she? A key scene has Liv Ullman, who plays the actress, watching a TV report on the Vietnam War. She is cracking. A nurse, played by Bibi Andersson, is chosen to take care of her. They go away to a secluded summer spot and become engaged in one of the most erotic and mysterious relationships in film history. I can describe what happens in laymen's terms, but there is no way to enlighten you regarding PERSONA's visual strategy. The nurse falls in love with the actress, and she does ALL of the talking. A story about a sexual rendezvous on a beach is told so well and for so long, you almost feel like you are WATCHING what she is talking about. So many of the images stay with you and your senses are put to the test.Liv Ullman is hypnotic as the \"actress\" who may or may not be scamming on the nurse for background research for a part. Or so the idea is implanted by the nurse. Sometimes you do ask what the hell is going on, but if you just relax and view without racking your brain for symbolism, you will take what Bergman is presenting to us. This is a film for film's sake. We are constantly reminded that we are watching film. The film even \"breaks\" when the tide starts to turn between the two women. Are they exchanging identities? I really don't think so. It is more cut and dry. A love story with gentle, dream-like lesbian undertones is on-screen.Again, explaining the film in words is a futile gesture. It is 70 percent visual. The dialogue (in Swedish with English subtitles) is low-key and mostly said by the nurse. There are scenes of absolute wonder, much like 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY. Some are easily understood, others not. There has never been nor will there ever be a film like this again. Ingmar Bergman starts us off with a flurry of eerie images: a young boy with his hands on the face of what appears to be the dissolved image of Andersson and Ullman's face; nails driven into a bloody hand, etc.. Enough already. Just see this bizarre, erotic \"story\" of two women that is not all that difficult to understand.RATING: 10 of 10: Use Discretion and Do Not Watch With A Crowd!"}, {"rank": 245, "name": "Persona", "movie_year": "1966", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "\"Persona\" is a highly metaphorical film.

The various perspectives do blend together, but there's more here than just a depiction of what cinema is and is not.Great performances by a pair of very beautiful and talented women, Ullmann and Andersson. Great cinematography as well. I particularly enjoy the shot of Andersson with her sunglasses on, leaning back against a white wall. Also the night scene with the two doors where Ullmann walks into Andersson's room wearing a white gown. The unadorned simplicity of the various settings is also enjoyable.The more I watch Bergman the more I appreciate his analysis of the polarization of modern existence, the vast gulfs which separate us from ourselves, from others, from God, and his belief that love is what can close those gaps.

Critic John Simon has gone so far as to say that \"'Persona' is to film what 'Ullysses' is to the novel.\" The comparison is apt. In capsule reviews Bergman's masterpiece is often reduced to something like... a story about an actress who stops talking and is sent to recuperate at a beach house with a talkative nurse at which time the two women's personalities mesh. (The self-referential elements, like the projector starting up, the film appearing to catch and burn, and the soundstage shot at the end, are usually not dealt with in these reviews.) But I think Bergman's working title for the film--\"Cinematography\"--gives a clue to what the film is REALLY about--or at least one of the things. \"Persona\" is about film; it is about the duplicity of film (tricking the eye into seeing motion; creating an illusion of reality, etc.) And it is about the mind's willingness--even eagerness--to accept the duplicity. It is about the duplicity of art and the artist (is s/he a humane observor, a voyeur or vampire--sucking the life from those observed?) In fact, it could be said that \"Persona\" is about duplicity in its broadest sense--the dual nature of things and the western obsession with seeing the world broken down into black and white dualities. But what's black is also white. Who's really the nurse and who's the patient in \"Persona\"? Who's the actress; who's playing a role? (If ever a film demanded to be made in black and white, this is it.) Yet \"Persona\" is much more than just a treatise on duality.

I know every scene and line by heart. Not because I'm one of those ghastly Python nerds, whose anal obsessiveness sucks the whole spirit out of everything they did, and actually misses the joke, which is on them; they are the perfect subjects for a Python lampoon. No. I only know LIFE OF BRIAN so intimately because I've seen it so often, it's still one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen, and persists in being hilarious despite familiarity, which, as in so much Python did, is the reverse of what comedy is 'supposed' to be made of (i.e. surprise).Also, nostalgia value. MONTY PYTHON were my first heroes, before I even reached double figures. I gobbled up every programme, film and record in a space of a couple of short years, so they are bound up with a period of my life when I was very happy and hopeful, so I go all misty-eyed when I see it. Bizarrely, we were first encouraged to watch BRIAN by our Latin teacher, who felt it was very insightful about Roman society.But no-one watches PYTHON anymore, except that dorkish clique. My brother, only a couple of years my junior, is as mystified now by my reaction to it as my parents were then. But surely BRIAN is a comic masterpiece in itself, accessible to anyone who found the very male, elitist, academic bias of the programme somewhat alienating?How can I implore you to watch this? It's got a straight narrative, with some of the greatest set-pieces and dialogue of any film ever. It's not a great FILM comedy - Terry Jones is no Gilliam - but the style suits the humour perfectly, allowing it to breathe, and sometimes pulling off an extraordinarily evocative shot, such as when Brian and his mother are walking from Jesus' sermon, and squabbling about petty things like big noses, and the camera pulls back to a vast Judean wasteland, with a massive Roman statue being wheeled, and a set of crucifixes being planted: a marvellous encapsulation of a period in history.This is the film's true triumph - it's a magnificent deconstruction of historical distortion. By paralleling the life of Christ with that of an ordinary little man, Python reclaim history from symbol and myth. It brings the body back into history. Its resolute rejection of divinity leads to a bleak, ironic conclusion (listen to 'Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life' carefully, and in context: it's NOT comforting) - the story of Jesus without redemption is ghastly.The intelligence behind the juvenile gags is astonishing - the film is a learned commentary on power, totalitarianism, repression, language, gender, the writing of history, the politics of subversion, the complicity of the repressed. Myth is thrown to the wind - the film succeeds where Reg and his revolutionaries fail, by revealing a whole series of repressive apparatum (sic?). No-one is spared - the film is unashamedly destructive, but the film's satire is not arid or narrow; there are many rich parallels with our own time, as the extraordinary reaction from the religious on the film's release showed.But BRIAN is not just an attack on religion, but on all who would seek to write selective histories for their own interests, suppressing others' voices. The silliest jokes are also the most profound - in one scene, the kidnappers enter Pilate's palace through a tiled floor. They emerge through a modesty-concealing leaf painted on this floor. This is snickering schoolboy humour, and very very funny, but is also a comment on the phallocentricity of imperialism. Jokes like these are why BRIAN will always remain vital - it turns you into a ludicrous, ill-informed amateur historian.The acting is an astonishing feat of multiple performances, but Graham Chapman, always my favorite Python, holds the chaos together, ironically as the Kafkaesque hero who races towards the abyss, an anti-Jesus to love and identify with. If I've made the film sound like hard work, than I'm an idiot. The seriousness is only there if you want it. Like Alice in Wonderland, or Buster Keaton, PYTHON seem to be full of metaphors that encapsulate the pains of life, but are also damnably entertaining. It's strange that men as supposedly 'surreal' and 'out there' as the Pythons should speak such good sense. Only BRINGING UP BABY, THE PALM BEACH STORY, and MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL, are funnier than this.

What's more, it makes it look easy. One moment they are making a very clever joke, which takes a lot of understanding, which makes many references to culture and history, and which makes a very good point, and the next joke in the script is \"Shut up, Big Nose!\" All the way through, this pattern is repeated, and all the way through, both kinds of joke are very funny.The pace never lets up, and it moves from one excellent sequence to another, each one advancing the plot (with the probable exception of the bit with the space ship). Along the way, one sees several classic moments which have since been much copied. Where were they first? In this film. \"What have the Romans ever given us?\", \"Splitter!\", \"Alms for an ex-leper!\" - if you don't see this film, then you will be missing out on some important popular culture.The cast is excellent, and each of the Python team plays several roles, sometimes even having to do reaction shots to shots of themselves playing other parts. This sort of ensemble casting is sadly rare in films, being a sort of theatrical ploy, and yet in this film it feels entirely natural.The film looks very good. In fact, it is probably the most visually convincing depiction of life in a biblical city I have seen. The Python team is made up of educated men, and these went to some effort to see that the costumes and sets, and atmosphere were up to scratch.

Swarmed by, more like!\") outside his window. It is that people should not follow religions like blind sheep, but should think for themselves. Few more worthwhile and sound messages could be preached by anyone.

I've seen it several times, and I've enjoyed it immensely each time for different reasons.\nAnalytically I find the animation incredible. The characters are extremely alive and quite realistic, not because of incredible drawing, well, actually, yes: the way the characters are drawn, and animated, is incredible. From the jerking, swaying and swooshing of body parts to the magnificent and CONSISTENT use of eyes, eyebrows and cheekbones to show real emotions, it's definite that this movie is a masterpiece in terms of animation. The backgrounds are wonderfully lush, and evoke a wonderful sense of everything that shows fall for the beautiful season it is. I love animation, and I love good looking landscapes, so the artists behind this movie are making a fan out of me very quickly.I admire (analytically) most of all the enormous apparance of little details in the film: the season sublty changes from fall to winter; the characters are always doing something, even if they aren't directly in focus (the best ad-libbing a director could dream of); I also think in some parts of the movie the little details actually become crucial to the movie's strength and validity (the time and setting of the story help it to make more sense, also, the \"duck and cover\" scene)You know, I think it's amazing when sometimes a movie can move you so much, talking about it's good qualities seems like child's play. This is the kind of movie that you can watch over and over and take a long time to get sick of. We all have movies like that, very few can do that to us, but we have them. I'm realising as I write that I like this movie very much, because I've written two or three paragraphs and have not even started talking about the iron giant yet.The animation and expression of emotion in the giant, who is a computer graphics animated character, a hundred feet tall and with a certain old time sci fi persona to him, equals and even surpasses it's traditionally animated companions. There were scenes in the movie that the giant almost made me cry because of his expressions. The director, Brad Bird I think, should earn good credit for his work bringing the giant to life. The giant was very organic and fluid, always animated and extremely alive, without really trying to be. After a while it obvious he's not your average rigid robot.It's hard not to give away details when you write a lot, but thankfully I haven't really given anything away. I will say this...the movie is about not prejudging things you are unfamiliar with, big or small, and it's about doing what is right and not using gray areas and politics as an excuse not to do the right thing. The movie explores the strange concept of finding friendship, love, and innocence inbetween past guilts and prejudices. It is one of the most well rounded, enriching, thought provoking movies I have seen in my lifetime, and the best part is that it wasn't the visual effects that made me say that...something other feature animation companies have used a a string to lead me on for almost a decade. I feel like I just recovered from an extended brainwashing experiment. I've learned my lesson. No longer will movies that use stunning graphics to redeem themselves be an interest to me. Rather I will watch movies for the messages they give and the depth those movies have. If anything Brad Bird must have tried to make the giant as close in simplicity to the regular animated characters as possible, because you CANNOT tell the difference between CG and traditional in this movie. Exceptional stuff.I can't imagine anyone I know not liking this movie. I've shown it to a LOT of people, college students mostly, of all races and religions, with different prides and prejudices, the result, amazingly, always seems to be the same: I have some after movie comments here, and I quote:\"Wow!\" ; \"That was NICE!\"; \"That was SO...GOOD!\" ;\"That giant is crucial, dog!\" ;\"It was good...yeah...I liked it!\",; and \"Dang man, that joint TIGHT!\".

I have no children. So why am I praising a 'kid's movie' which nobody saw? Because I have never seen a film pack the emotional wallop 'The Iron Giant' provided.The film's plot is similar to 'E.T.' - a young boy meets an alien robot from outer space, who is stranded on earth, and runs afoul of paranoid government agents. Not to knock the Spielberg film, but what makes 'The Iron Giant' the better film is that the young boy is the teacher. It is he who has to teach the Giant about the beauty of life, the difference between good and evil, and choices we have to make. The Iron Giant, it turns out, is a weapon, who has to struggle against his own nature. The film has an obvious (and timely) gun control message, but its real message is about the choice we make when dealing with other people. We can use our powers for good or lash out at everyone around us.I dare not give away the climax. All I will say is that it features a sacrifice absolutely breaktaking and emotionally shattering (albeit somewhat blunted by the ending). The animation is gorgeous, Michael Kamen's score is perfect, and the film beautifully evokes the 1950s.Sadly, poor marketing kept audiences away in droves. All I can say is, to heck with the box office gross. Despite Warner's appearant desire to pretend the film never existed, the word is getting around about what a magical film this is, and I have no doubt it will join 'It's a Wonderful Life' as a film which bombed in theatres but became a classic over the years. See it now, so you can say you discovered it before everyone else did."}, {"rank": 247, "name": "The Iron Giant", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "I've just watched the DVD version of \"Iron Giant.\" I found the story line to be one of the most cliche' plots in all of animation. There is an obvious anti-gun message that is rather silly and ineffective. Then there's the all too familiar \"kid without a father\" theme that Hollywood beats like a dead horse. Hardly the sort of stuff that makes for a great film. But, worst of all, it is filled with logical and factual errors that stretch the already thin credibility of animated flicks.Despite all that, I just loved this movie!Of all the films I've seen in 1999, this is definitely the best of the lot-- animated or live action. And I say this just having seen \"Toy Story 2\" a few weeks back, which is now my second favorite film of '99. \"Iron Giant\" kicked it out of first place. (You know it's a bad year for movies when your top two favorites are animations...) Flaws and all, this film has more heart and emotion than any other 10 Hollywood films of 1999 combined.The film takes place during 1957. We have a story about a boy named Hogarth (without a father, of course...) who finds a giant iron robot from outer space while searching the woods for invaders from Mars. After being initially scared to death of the creature, he quickly realizes the robot is not out to harm him- and so, in short order, the boy befriends him. The rest of the movie deals with the boy's efforts to hide a 100ft. tall robot from the local townspeople of Rockwell, Maine and the United States government.While there's nothing cliche' about a boy taking a walk in the woods and discovering a huge metallic robot suffering from amnesia munching on the local electric power plant, the \"...boy meets awesomely powerful yet benign creature and quickly befriends him while everyone else wants to kill him...\" plot has been done too many times to count. Yet the film's writers, directors and animators take us down this well-traveled path in such a way that new life is breathed into this most ancient of fairy tales. For that feat alone, the movie is deserves every drop of praise it gets.The film is a parable of the atomic age. The fears and paranoias of the time are summed up in the government agent sent out to find the giant robot, \"Kent Mansly.\" He's a walking, talking tribute to the \"red under every bed\" mindset. The innocent and fun loving target of his paranoia, the boy Hogarth, contrasts Mansly. Hogarth is about the best portrayal of a red blooded 50's era American boy that's ever been put to screen, despite the fact that he's a simple drawing.\"Iron Giant\" should not be mistaken for a mere kid's flick. Parents will like it as much if not more than their children. The message of the film is one of love and self-sacrifice, the kind of thing most of us want to instill in our kids. In it's own way, \"Iron Giant' is a kind of \"Saving Private Ryan\" for children.Ultimately, this is a love story between a boy and his robot. Yes, it sounds silly, but you'll have to see it yourself to understand how the writers & directors pull it off. There is a moral to this film, or I should say, \"morals.\" The morals are not heavy handed or preached, but they are expounded upon by the actions of the characters themselves. My favorite lesson had to do with \"peace through superior fire power!\"But don't take my word for how good it is. My four-year-old son watched the DVD three times in a 24-hour period, and watched it every day we had it for the seven-day rental period. I believe it's now his new favorite film. We judge how much he likes a film by the amount of times he asks to see it again. The last movie he wanted to watch as much as this one is \"A Bug's Life.\"Interesting note: \"Iron Giant,\" along with \"Toy Story 2,\" both pay homage to good old \"Sputnik\" -the first ever satellite launched into earth's orbit. It's neat how these two rather unrelated stories both deal with the significance of that event.Don't bother renting this film. Just buy it the next time you see it on sale.

I try to be objective about it, but at least part of me likes this movie because it's an animated feature that isn't Disney and doesn't conform to the horrible and (at least i think) destructive formula that Disney has decided that our children are best served.This movie had brilliant visual effects. Beautiful, awe-inspiring, altogether wonderful visuals. Some nice touches of realism too (Hogarth being knocked down into the giant's palm as the giant stood up was a nice touch). The voice talent was excellent on all fronts, and the direction, just wow.That being said, I have to take exception with the ending. The ending took an incredibly powerful scene of personal sacrifice and goodness and just plain cheapened it. The natural theme of the story is heroism. The giant's heroic act, which would have perfectly completed the movie, was near ruined by the final scene.It almost seems like the ending was tacked on after the story was complete, because otherwise, I really don't see any point for the dialogue about souls not dying. It seems like this was meant to soften the blow of the giant's sacrifice, but because of that (insert expletive) last scene there's no sacrifice to lessen!So, when I watch this movie, I find it best to stop the tape right after the statue scene and pretend the rest never happened.The only other issue I have with the movie (and it's a small one) is the hunter scene. Those hunters are put in a bad light for killing the innocent little deer, and if they were sport hunting, they should be put in a bad light, but if they were food hunting, I think the movie was overly harsh on them. Though we like to pretend we aren't, we are still a species that kills animals to eat and survive.Overall, though, a real good movie.

It's become such a cliche that kids aren't being entertained like they used to (don't fear TARZAN, though, a wonderful movie).I knew I was going to enjoy this movie's retro 50s-like animation immensely, but I was surprised how much more I enjoyed. The movie isn't concerned how life-like the characters are, because ultimately it's the actions that make them more realistic than how they appear.Eli Marienthal's voice is incredibly convincing as the young boy Hogarth and the title robot is the most enjoyable and friendly creature to watch since E.T. almost twenty years ago. The Iron Giant is voiced with mechanical authenticity by Vin Diesel who marvelously makes the audience not only believe but love and sympathize for this colossal metal man. There are also good (voice)performances by Harry Connick Jr. (who sounds like a cajun Bruce Willis here) and Christopher McDonald (who I was convinced was Tim Allen). One of the great moments are when Hogarth teaches his new mechanical buddy about Superman, and the Iron Giant decides he wants to be a hero.It is almost inevitable for a movie like this not to have a message, but the great thing is that not only is it a good and heartwarming message, but it isn't handed to us in a heavy and literal way. Guns are bad and they are only used for killing. Near the end I almost felt ashamed that I was starting to get a bit misty.

Here we have an intelligent, and entertaining film about a boy who befriends a giant robot from origins unknown. The characters are not dumbed down in anyway, and there is no need to break out into song as many recent animated films have done. We are carried along by the story and the curiosity about what will happen next to Hogarth and his giant friend. One of the best sequences in the film is toward the end when the Giant and Hogarth are knocked out of the sky. Once they land, the Giant shows more emotion and range than many living actors can muster. The result is a scene that's full of power and emotion. The climax of the film is fitting, but I can't say what it is, you have to see it for yourself. A great film to show to the entire family."}, {"rank": 247, "name": "The Iron Giant", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Finally, finally, finally a worthy alternative to the ruthless, cookie-cutter Disney stranglehold on feature animation; this film is not only thoughtful, entertaining, and technically excellent, it avoids all the assembly-line pitfalls the Disney features have fallen into lately. No lame \"comic\" relief (and even better, no Rosie O'Donnell), no attempts to \"update\" the story with a \"nineties twist\", no terrible songs, no multiple story climaxes . . . in short, everything that's wrong with Disney push-button dreck is right about THE IRON GIANT.The story is told simply, with very little extra embellishment, and with genuine warmth, humor and sincerity, so it's a shame more people didn't see it in the theatres (but, honestly, those are probably the very reasons they didn't). The main character, Hogarth, is a likeable little boy, realistically portrayed. It's a credit to the filmmakers that they didn't feel the need to have the character be hip, flippant or disrespectful, a sad trend in movies. He's very much like a real little boy.Forget TARZAN, with its main character surfin' through the jungle with his Brooklynite talk-show host gorilla sidekick for painful \"comedy\" relief (where's the relief from the comedy relief, I'd like to know), and do yourself and your kids (and your brains) a favor, and check out this underrated gem.

Such a case is The Iron Giant. Many people are blaming its poor showing on Warner Bros lack of advertising, which is ridiculous. I dislike the idea that unless we're inundated with Happy Meal tie-ins and action figures, the film is under-advertised. There certainly was adequate advertising for this film; it simply wasn't in titanic Disney proportions.The Iron Giant is, no exaggeration, one of the best animated films of the last ten years. As a childhood fable, as a view of fifties foreign paranoia, as a statement on violence, it works perfectly. There isn't a single flawed scene from beginning to end. And it proves conclusively that animation can work without cute animal sidekicks or overwrought musical numbers; just a great story, brilliantly timed comedy, and some truly touching moments.The combination of cel animation and computer imagery is seamless, with each technique used to its best effect. The voice-acting is top-notch, with Christopher MacDonald particularly good as the paranoid government agent. Having not read the book myself, I can't vouch for the film's adherence to the original story, but I highly recommend it to any lover of animation.Incidentally, lest you think it's purely for children, I watched it with a group of men over thirty, and we all loved it.

Well, everyone should be pleased to know that this movie is not targeted at any specific age group! The best film-makers know that great animated movies should appeal to everyone; just adding on the word \"animated\" does not automatically equate to a movie for kids only. The strongest asset of The Iron Giant lies in the writing. EVERY character is nothing short of believable and realistic, and there are several fairly strong including \"guns kill\" and \"souls can't die.\" This may sound trite when taken out of context and put on paper, but the delivery of these in the actual film is anything but. How often do we get animated features like this, that depart form the traditional formula and deliver truly positive messages, all without turning preachy? In addition to the dramatic elements, there's a good share of successful comedy. The whole \"superman\" element is amusing, and several other parts (including the bit where the Giant decides to emulate Hogarth's cannonball dive into a lake) are worth laughing out loud for. Also, in what is a VERY wise decision, there are no musical numbers and no obligatory comic-relief characters. Inserting either would hurt The Iron Giant's overall flow greatly, as the script and voice acting are intelligent enough to deliver the entertainment on their own. Finally, just to compliment things, the visuals are really cool. I clearly noticed changes in style throughout; the backgrounds, foreground objects, and characters all have their own distinct look and feel, making the environment suitably lush. The bottom line? Well, I would reccomend THE IRON GIANT to anyone, regardless of age. Hands down, this is the best animated film I've ever seen thus far.

It tells the story of a giant, amnesiac robot who falls to Earth, and is eventually befriended by a local boy, Hogarth Hughes. Hogarth must hide the robot from a paranoid government agent who suspects it a Soviet weapon of war. The truth is that the robot is indeed essentially a giant gun, but hails from a distant planet and bears unbelievable firepower! Ultimately, it is the friendship with the boy that brings out the robot's compassion and humanity, and saves the town from annihilation.I liked this film so much that after I saw it, I emailed everyone on my many contact lists and practically begged them to put on their shoes and hit the theatre to support this amazing film.

My bulk email was a modest campaign to boost awareness of the film, because in Hollywood there is just one truth: the success of a movie is based on its gross. If a piece of s**t movie does well, more piece of s**t movies like it will get made. Conversely, if an intelligent, well-written movie does not make its financial mark, that kind of movie will fall out of favour with the fatcats who make the decisions back at the studio.

It was a beautiful film that reflects the Communist paranoia of 1950s America through a boy and a metallic alien in rural New England. This movie is a genuine treat. It is something that adults can relate to with the myriad of reference to 50s culture, and both children and adults will love its innocence.The film is drawn in a classical animation style like early Disney films to give the audience a feel of the time in which it is set. Unlike recent Disney films (thankfully), The Iron Giant does not have any cutesy little \"friends\" that serve as comic relief or to create nausea for the viewer. Instead, the filmmaker respects the audience's intelligence (both children and adults) by giving us a simple story that does not rely on embellishment to make itself more viewer friendly. It doesn't need it.The author started with a concept - what if a gun had a soul? - and created this brilliant animated feature in the same vain of Spielberg's E.T.-The Extra-Terrestrial. It stands as a testament to what animated films should be (it is possibly the best in over 50 years), but what's more, it stands as a testament to what FILMS should be.

If you do not have the name \"Walt Disney\" placed before the title of your family film, it's usually a sure bet that your movie won't make much money in the box office, but the film will do well in the video market. But every now and then there is a family film that rises out of the juvenile and childish ashes and shines brightly on the faces of both the young and old. In 1995 Universal released that family film, and it is titled BABE. In 1997 Fox released their family film titled ANASTASIA, which was both spectacular and fantastic. Now it's Warner Bros. turn, and their film is called THE IRON GIANT, which isn't only the best family film of the year, but one of the best movies of the year. THE IRON GIANT takes place during the Communist scare of 1957. It's the animated tale of a young boy named, Hogarth Hughes (voiced by Eli Marienthal) who is kind, smart, and intelligent. Hogarth lives with his mom, Anne Hughes (Jennifer Aniston) who is a waitress at the town's popular diner. One night while Hogarth's mom is working late at the diner, Hogarth is up late at night watching t.v., until the reception goes bad. Hogarth sees that the antenna for the t.v. is missing, and there's a trail leading out to the woods. Out in the woods Hogarth sees a 100 foot tall metal robot that's made of metal, that is at first eating the metal off of a electrical power station, until the robot gets tangled in the power lines and is getting electrocuted. Hogarth, with sypmathy, turns off the power to the station and saves the robot. It is then that the young boy and the robot become friends. Meanwhile, one of the fishermen who's boat crashed into the robot while it crashed landed on earth, calls the government and they send over government agent Kent Mansley (Christopher McDonald). Mansley believes that the robot will pose a threat to the people and sees that it must be found and destroyed. So Hogarth decides to hide the robot in the town's junkyard run and owned by beatnik Dean McCoppin (Harry Connick Jr.). It's only a matter of time that Hogarth teaches the Iron Robot the ways of life, before agent Mansley finds the robot. Parents complain that Hollywood needs to make more family orientated films. Well, Waner Bros. (a Hollywood studio) had made the ideal family film, and sad to say, nobody is seeing it. While parent groups are in meetings bashing such films as: MATRIX, WILD WILD WEST, AMERICAN PIE, AUSTIN POWERS 2, and SOUTH PARK; they are guilty of not letting their children watch a great movie like this. Instead, these \"guilty\" parents are letting their children become lab-rabbits and let them be exposed to such adult orientated films as the ones I meantion above, and then go to meetings and rallies to protest the films that shouldn't be viewed by young children. Or maybe these parents don't really want to see a children's film, and would rather see a film that they would want to see, and bring their children along so they can spend the money on refreshments and not on some baby-sitter. That's a shame, since this is a excellent family film, yet like ANASTASIA, it's not pulling in much money into the box office. Perhaps it's because that children would rather see talking animals than an animated person, that would explain on why BABE was such a big hit (but please, DO NOT let them watch the upcoming TNT film ANIMAL FARM, that will traumatize kids for years). What I personally liked about THE IRON GIANT is two things: the cute homage to the life-style of the 1950's, and the humor. First the homage, this film really makes a nice and witty look at what life was like in the 50's. From the cheesy \"Duck & Cover\" films, to the witty satire of the sci-fi/horror films. Then there's the humor, where nothing is offensive, but it's still funny and clever. No wonder, THE IRON GIANT is directed by Brad Bird, who has made some of the funniest animated t.v. shows ever. Including the AMAZING STORIES episode of \"THE FAMILY DOG,\" THE CRITIC, KING OF THE HILL, and my favorite, THE SIMPSONS. I think Disney is missing out on not having Brad Bird work for them, he would turn Disney's animated films from cutesy to witty, and hopefully less musical numbers. But since THE IRON GIANT, is still playing in the theaters, go take the kids to see it!!! And if you don't have any kids, go see it anyways!!! I would rather take kids to see this film than INSPECTOR GADGET. The critics would also agree with me, but people don't like to listen to critics. But it's the critic's that people should listen to when it comes to a family film, since most critics reccommend BABE, ANASTASIA, and THE IRON GIANT. It's a really touching and nice family film that comes out every so often that will entertain both the young and the young at heart.

Much like this year's other great underdog, the Sixth Sense, the Iron Giant truly comes out of nowhere in a once commercialized or stupidized genre. And both have similar storylines, namely about a boy who has something very special about him. In the film, young Hogarth Hughes of Rockwell, Maine, finds a giant robot in the woods behind his house. With the robot apparently having lost his memory from a bump on his head, he befriends young Hogarth....actually, Hogarth befriends him. As most reviews have stated, there are no stupid Disney-used traits at all in this film. NO dumb sidekicks, no stupid songs, and excellent characters, including the Giant himself. Hogarth, his mother, and the rest, all feel and act like they should from their respective backgrounds. So no one here is exceptionally heroic, or sarcastic. I have endless praise for this film. It is bold and grand in every aspect. It is my favorite film of all time, tied with the Matrix and South Park: Bigger, Longer, And Uncut. And on one last note, it would be a tragedy if this fine film is overlooked by other underdogs from this year such as the Sixth Sense and....well, so far, these are the only 2 movies this year that I have seen (with the possible exceptions of south park and the matrix) that deserve to be nominated this year."}, {"rank": 247, "name": "The Iron Giant", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "A few thoughts on this film-it was beautifully animated, had a nice score, and a deep story for an animated film.

They've seen the commercials and knew several of the characters already. In advance, I had warned them that there weren't any sidekicks or catchy songs as they've been accustomed to. By the end of the film, their eyes were downcast...and it wasn't from sleep-deprivation.The film isn't all that it was hyped to be. Much of what you see in the commercials is the whole film...why go to the theaters? The commercials tell you everything! Moreover, the story isn't widely original, either. If you've ever watched \"We're Back\", \"Pete's Dragon\", \"All Dogs Go To Heaven\" or \"E.T.\" (all children/family movies) then you've already watched this film. It's the typical plot about children who find an amazing discovery, keep it a secret, abuse its powers, and learn to extend beyond their own feelings. For my children, probably the most damaging to the plot, however, was their dislike of the giant itself. There wasn't enough to connect him with the audience which undermines the emotion the rest of the film builds on. Without the connection between such a key character, the audience loses interest.Furthermore, the movie's animation barely matched with current releases. There weren't as many lush color tones or smooth-running lines to make the film visually appealing. Don't get me wrong, Warner Brothers has had great animation in the past (although its last ventures \"Quest For Camelot\" and \"The King and I\" were complete flops). If they'd only stick with Bugs Bunny, they'd have the works played out in their hands. \"Space Jam\" was wildly successful, plus the shading and colors of \"old\" characters brought new life to their persona. In several aspects, \"Space Jam\" was far superior from animation to plot, aesthetics to witty lines when compared to \"The Iron Giant\". Where past Warner Brothers animation aimed toward the family, \"The Iron Giant\" aimed for the commercial. Several times, the topic of Superman (a character which Warner Brothers owned) was brought up. Soon, we'll see Superman figures lined up with the corny Iron Giant banks and toothbrushes.Lastly, there's the objectional material. For the first time in my life, I saw the main character of a cartoon, feature-length movie use the restroom. The use of the bathroom is all too common in live action films, but they've begun to pass surreptitiously into cartoons. Why does such a scene need to take place? All in all, the film relays an anti-government atmosphere. The main characters are always on the run while officials heartlessly chase its \"victims\". I admit, several children's books are perfect for Hollywood. This one may have been one if taken from a different approach."}, {"rank": 247, "name": "The Iron Giant", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "I recently had the pleasure of seeing the Iron Giant with two members of LA's animation industry and was pleasantly surprised by a movie I had heard very little about.This is an excellent movie.

Maybe they could have made the moral more reasonable, i.e. \"gun's can be good if used defensively\", but I guess that would have (** spoiler alert!! **) made the ending far less dramatic - a blast from one of the robot's lasers would probably have sufficed.I saw \"Iron Giant\" a few weeks after release, and the theater was, sadly, almost empty. Word-of-mouth and critic reviews have been very good, so I guess we would have to chalk it up to poor marketing.

The Cold War was a waste of people's lives and times. The boy is fatherless, in fact, because he was a pilot who died in Korea (we can assume). The methods that our government provided us for protection were all lies, such as the Duck and Cover film that must be seen to be believed. Best of all, the film is strongly anti-gun. The giant, like all of us in our insane country, can be a gun. He chooses not to be and chooses not to hurt others. It is a choice we can all make by saying no to guns and gun violence. The military and government officals suffer some well-deserved put-downs, and the hero's friend is a subversive beatnik artist. What could be better than that?

It conveys the \"innocence of childhood\" (pardon the cliche) as well as E.T. Like Toy Story, it keeps you engrossed in a simple, but engaging narrative by animation that actually augments, rather than detracts, from the story. Possibly most compelling, for me at least, it manages to transport you into the paranoid yet somehow rarefied atmosphere of the Cold War, much as the 1993 film Matinee did.I had prepared myself for the worst - stillborn plots, offensive characters, embarrassingly inappropriate musical numbers, etc. a la Disney. When I walked out of the Iron Giant, I found myself wondering how they managed to do everything so *right* when so many other animated films get it so wrong. In fact, this is really the only good animated kids' film since Toy Story (and woe unto us when Toy Story II comes out).As a professed gun nut, I would have expected to find the movie's anti-gun message objectionable. That wasn't even remotely the case. The gun thing was only the toe-nail to the greater issue of self-determination, and the deliberate sacrifices that one must make to choose the path of heroism, rather than destruction. That point is made poignant because ???spoiler??? .....................the Giant is a destroyer by nature.I also couldn't get over the way the movie made me wonder why it is so hard in film to stay away from violence when striving for heroism. It seems that every hero has a mean streak, or is eventually forced to violence by the bad guys; for once I had no reservations explaining to my son the Giant's motivations for doing what he did.Finally, I hope that everyone sees this film. It deserves better than it will get, and we deserve more good stuff like it. It's not every day that you can look at the viewer reviews and see that *every* one is positive.

But it is no mere meteorite; it is a 100 ft. tall metal-eating giant robot, sentient and sensitive. It is discovered by Hogarth Hughes, a young boy who lives with his mother. His father, possibly a jet pilot (photo in frame), is either dead or has divorced his mother. After the initial shock and fear, Hogarth befriends the iron giant, and slowly, almost without realizing it, teaches the giant about ethics and morality (that we all have souls, that souls live on forever, that it is wrong to kill). Trouble comes in the form of a government man who, displaying the paranoia of 1950's America, sees the giant as a potential threat.The animation is reminiscent of Don Bluth's work, without the insipid, treacly and gratuitous musical numbers. It portrays children, in particula r Hogarth, realistically, and reminded me of the innocent sweetness of the children in Miyazaki's films, \"My Neighbor, Totoro\" and \"Kiki's Delivery Service.\"The blending of computer-generated and traditional animation is virtually seamless and artfully-done.The scripting is at once funny, intelligent and bittersweet without being maudlin. I loved the wonderful attention paid to details: The \"Duck and Cover cartoons\" were accurate and hilarious; Detailing, even down to the F-86's, period jet fighters, was amazing; The subtle homages paid to other sci-fi genre TV and films such as \"Johnny Sako and His Giant Robot,\" or the cobra-like martian death rays from \"War of the Worlds.\"Inevitably, some will compare this film to the book by Ted Hughes. While director/screenwriter Brad Bird may have taken liberties with the original storyline, I think the movie carries the gentleness and intelligent spirit of Hughes's book.

Each movie features young protagonists who are dreamers and outsiders of their societies and present refreshingly peaceful resolutions to their respective conflicts.\"The Iron Giant\" has a wonderful nostalgic, small-town atmosphere that is brought to life by the stunning animation that is on par with anything that Disney has produced recently. The attention to period detail, from the cheesy educational videos that Hogarth's class is forced to watch, to the way townspeople talk, is faithfully recreated and really goes a long way to drawing you into this engaging world. In some respects, the animation style of this film recalls the early, groundbreaking Fleischer brothers Superman cartoons of the 1940s with its depth of field, but without the German Expressionist influence.The real strength of this film is the relationships between the characters -- something that is often overlooked in animated films for flashy visuals and epic musical numbers. \"The Iron Giant\" has the feel of a very intimate, character-driven film with the relationship between Hogarth and his robot friend as the emotional centre but with several other relationships (like the ones between Hogarth and his mother and between him and Dean) also featured prominently as well. This is no simple Saturday morning cartoon but a strong feature film that actually has something to say.\"The Iron Giant\" is one of those rare animated films that appeals to both children and adults, that doesn't contain one annoying musical number a la Disney, and that isn't one long advertisement for a toy.

The film doesn't talk down to it's audience, and instead tells a simple story very well. My only complaint would be that Hogarth is somewhat of a smart-alec at times, but I guess this is the era of Leave it To Beaver.Many of the situations are standard movie-fare, the ex-lax in the food, the helmet on the bed, but it's nice to see them in an animated film for a change. As an anime fan, the realism of the movie didn't impress me as much as the quality of the writing, voice acting, and the music and sound effects.

I bawled like a baby near the end.Finally, most importantly for me, there are NO CHEAP LAUGHS in the movie. One of the best moments in the movie for me was when Hogarth is running through the woods and he slams his face into a low branch.

The kids (and parents) quickly cease their laughter.

It respects the audience's intelligence, it has genuine emotion without resorting to schmaltz, and best of all it balances fantasy (well, science fiction) with believability. I think Warner Brothers animation has out-Disneyed Disney by adding thoughtful writing to clean, understated animation. What a concept!The story is deceptively simple: Iron Giant falls from the sky at the dawn of the Space Race and befriends a young boy. But within that framework we get a double story, one for the grown ups and one for the kids, but the message is essentially the same one: paranoia and violence begets violence. I appreciate very much, as others who have commented, that no one burst into incongruous song and that there were no cutesy animal sidekicks. I should add that there were no clever yet implausible plot twists, nor were there any stock characters. The bad guy gets a little overheated, true, but he is never the embodiment of all things evil. The townspeople are your average small town Americans, not bumpkins. Mom is, well, mom-ish, caring but neither shrewish nor prone to whimpering outbursts. And our hero is plucky but not annoyingly precocious.A BIG plus for this film is how well it weds the computer animation to the hand-drawn animation, a feat that the Big Mouse hasn't mastered yet. Even as recently as \"Tarzan\" it is glaringly apparent what parts are computer graphics and which aren't, and the contrast is very distracting. \"The Iron Giant\" makes a virtue of streamlined animation that draws your eye to the beauty of its color and motion.It was a very VERY distinct and unusual pleasure to be treated to a film such as this.

Had the animation and design been as bland and pedestrian as the recently released \"The King and I\", few movie-goers would be as fond of the film. In fact, I think it would be a bomb.The characters are certainly likeable, but too one-dimensional to rise above being mere character \"types\". We learn virtually nothing about them, other than what they are up to in the present moment. It's as if they have no existence, no thoughts, no life at all other than what we happen to be seeing up there on the screen. There is no depth to them that would suggest that their lives and their world extends beyond the edge of the frame.There's the precocious boy (Hogarth) that knows more than the grown-ups, the flustered but loving Mom who tries to understand her mischievous son, the friendly adult (Dean) who's really young at heart and serves as an ally to the boy, and on and on. And how convenient that Hogarth lives on a farm where there's a big barn, suitable for storing a large robot. How convenient that Dean works in an iron-filled junk yard and makes art out of iron--choices that come in very handy when one has a large iron robot to contend with.What I'm objecting to in this film is what I see as a lack of fresh ideas in the story and the script. Clever, original thought has been sacrificed (as it usually is) for the same old cliches. As a result, there were almost no surprises in this film. Young people who aren't as familiar with the cliches will have a ball, I'm sure. And adults who enjoy re-visiting the cliches that are comfortably familiar will love it, too. But for those who want to be impressed with new perspectives, or delighted with clever surprises and unexpected turns in the story, this film will not satisfy."}, {"rank": 247, "name": "The Iron Giant", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "I'll tell you, no film this year will tug your heartstrings like this one.

I did not see any trailers and avoid TV (why watch the boob tube when you can spend the time at the movies?), so I knew only that it was about a giant robot. I have had a thing for giant robots since childhood, which usually results in me going to see crap like \"Robot Jox\". I am also a fan of films that satirize the '50s.The first few minutes of the film established that it was going to be a superbly animated film, if nothing else, although I've seen it twice on two different theatres so far and both time the first scenes in the small town were jerky and out of focus...luckily whatever caused this was not apparent for the remainder of the film. The first minutes up through the scary (for kids) scene at the power distribution center in the woods resulted in many younger kids in the audience screaming to leave the theatre. But then, even they were caught up and were very quiet for the rest of it. PARENTS: this is probably not a good film for kids under 5 years old (empirical observation).Other reviews have pretty well covered the material, but I will highlight what worked for me. 1) anti Disney-formula 2) no songs 3) no cute animals or sidekicks 4) fine artwork 5) inspired storytelling & script 6) straight forward yet dead-on vocal work from the actors 7) amazing character development for the robot 8) it made me weep from both emotion of the story and joy at the quality 9) the audience was not distracting since they were all totally absorbed in the storytelling 10) great satire on many levelsWhat did I dislike? I hate the simplistic 'guns are evil' concept. The scene where the hunters run off after killing the deer, yet the kid forgets them and instructs the robot that it is the gun on the ground that did the killing. Luckily, the film corrects this later on, establishing that the real problem is with the foolish people who want to shoot anything they don't understand (the robot in this case), while the robot who is clearly designed to be a fearsome weapon is able to gain a soul through his lucky interaction with a totally unprejudiced boy and use himself not as a killing machine but rather as a heroic character.

Brad Bird has crafted a fully realized world from the fifties, and set it in the animation style familiar to those times. There are shades of Lady and the Tramp in the large lines and fluid movement that the human characters exhibit. More telling than any technical aspect, though(including the amazing computer-generated giant), is the script. This is a beautiful one.

But then along comes something like \"The Iron Giant\", which is sophisticated enough to demand respect while maintaining a mythic and pure-hearted tone that actually does appeal to the kid in everybody.\"The Iron Giant\" is refreshingly non-Disney in no end of ways. Characters seem real and chosen to fit the story, instead of being a superficial reshuffling of an old formula. The animation definitely has its eye-popping moments, but there are also scenes of great wonderment, pathos, and humour that only top-drawer animation can convey. The Giant itself is a great character, who only becomes MORE interesting as the film continues (another huge break from Disney). No scene is wasted in this film, either; every set piece, even the really funny ones, helps either to establish the \"world\" of the movie, or to advance the plot. At no time do you feel that you are merely waiting for the story to crank up again.\"The Iron Giant\" is funny, exhilarating, and touching as well. It's sad to see it failing at the box office, as a blunt reminder that the success of films is often in direct proportion to their publicity budget.

The parent who sat beside us had a boy about 7 or 8. the child was asking a lot of deep, good questions that the parent did not have time to really answer and discuss with the child.

The screenplay is wonderful, all of the characters are incredibly three-dimensional (something which, alas, I have a difficult time saying about the most recent Disney films), and the voice-over acting is simply the best ever. The young boy who voiced the character of Hogarth Hughes is a true talent - his voice coupled with Hogarth's animator's drawing prowess gives the audience the best depiction of a young person ever. Hogarth is very honest and real-to-life, from his innocent romping and make-believe sessions to his deepest and most heartfelt emotions; at no point in the film does director Brad Bird patronize youth. Hogarth is unabashedly human and not a \"boy as he should be\" caricature. Not since Elliot in \"E.T.\" has a young character been so real.The character of the Iron Giant is so well drawn - both visually and emotionally - that I often had to remind myself that he was not a living, breathing human being. In fact, the magic and mystery of this film is the fact that it took a character of cold metal and made it more human than the average person one sees walking down the street. The Giant is a wonderful symbol of modern man and the beautiful heart that is still within him, albeit buried deeply beneath layers of materialism and aggression.

With Warner Brothers animation, they seem to be taking more risks with their own product. From the cross-promotion antics of the lively \"Space Jam\" to the noble failure of \"Quest For Camelot\", The WB has been fighting mightily to grab the animation crown of recognition that sits rusted on top of mount Disney. With \"Iron Giant\", Bugs and company jump miles ahead of any cartoon competition (except for the \"South Park\" feature) to create a timeless, and nearly flawless, animated feature. You just know you're in good hands when director Brad Bird's past credits include a stint as a writer-director on the genius animated show \"The Simpsons\". That show often goes out of it's way to parody Disney animation and others of it's ilk. Bird knows exactly what trappings to avoid and what emotional buttons to push. It is this knowledge in the end that makes \"Giant\" so effective. The story, based on a children's novel entitled \"The Iron Man\", is set in 1957, just as the cold war was getting warm. Hogarth Hughes is a precocious 10 year-old boy with big dreams trapped in a paranoid society in deep fear of the Red Menace. His single mother (voiced with honey by Jennifer Aniston, who's name is misspelled in the end credits) works long hours to pay the bills, and Hogarth is often left alone and lonely. When an iron robot crash lands on Earth one stormy night, Hogarth discovers the Giant and quickly befriends the dazed and confused robot. Soon after, a government agent (another sneaky Christopher McDonald acting job) learns of the Giant's appearance and sets out to destroy the Giant without ever truly understanding that the robot means no harm. One of the first things that director Bird gets just perfectly is the tone and color of 1950's America. Now, we've seen this period time and again in movies, just not this accurate. The threat of Russian invasion hangs in the air like an old sock. The kids watch \"duck and cover\" reels in school. The government, having been burned by Sputnik, experiences the itchiest trigger finger know to man. All the \"Leave It To Beaver\" type material is represented in this film as well, but for a movie aimed at 10 year-olds? Warner Brothers and Brad Bird deserve much credit for keeping this cartoon more cerebral than any in recent history. This is one good script and story, told with zest and intelligence. I also applaud the simple notion of keeping the Giant's origins a mystery. We never know where the Giant came from or what it's purpose in the grand scheme of things inevitably is. With every film wasting time spelling things out for the audience, \"Iron Giant\" asks you to just use your imagination. What a notion.Using period pastels and detailed architecture, it is the look of this animated feature that truly thrilled me. So used to current Disney animation am I that to see a cartoon in the widescreen format literally makes me weep (even if it ends up being the lame Super 35 format). \"Giant\" easily is the best looking cartoon to come around in decades. It looks like they spent 3 years on each shot. Bird and crew create a unique looking film that seems to be born of the comics and the animation itself of the day. With five o'clock shadows on the men, deliriously wrinkled faces of the aged, and the scary waistlines of the women, \"Giant\" is spot-on with it's drawings. I could watch the film time and again just for the animation. It makes up for some iffy drama that occupies the film's 2nd act.To see a film like \"Inspector Gadget\", with it's relentless delivery and shameless corporate plugs(I know \"Giant\" will have a merchandising landslide, but the film never feels like a 90 minute toy commercial), make a killing at the box office, it's imperative that a film like \"Iron Giant\" be known. We need more story-centric cartoons like this. I'm embarrassed to admit that I felt an outpouring of emotion at the end of the film. It's rare to get an animated feature that engages the crowd with lovable characters without being so calculated. It's even more rare to get an animated film that has no songs to drown the narrative. \"Iron Giant\" is told clean and true. The bittersweet climax (reminiscent of the traumatizing \"Fox And The Hound\") left me thrilled with \"Iron Giant\" even more. This is one good animated film that should finally put Warner Brothers on the map. I strongly recommend it. --------------- 9/10"}, {"rank": 247, "name": "The Iron Giant", "movie_year": "1999", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Do you yearn for good animation and story?

This was 6,50$can extremely well spent and it was a very good surprise for me because, let's face it, the TV ads doesn't make it justice.The characters are extremely well developed, although the villain tend to be the caricatural type, but, I insist, only him. All the others characters are sounds and credible. The story is simple enough to be understood by young children, and yet, at the same time, is complex enough to draw the parents into it. It is a good thing that \"The Iron Giant\" didn't go through the Disney studios because they would have destroy those two basic elements [characters + story] to \"accommodate\" their own simpleton standards.Technically, even if the movie looks like having been made in the 1960s, it is not. The use of lights and shadows give it a real 3 dimensional look that wasn't seen before the computer effects. And contrary to the American version of \"Godzilla\", the giant doesn't change size from one scene to the other. Also, the use of the Japanese style [big eyes] help a lot to make the emotions go through each characters. Even the robot, which tells a lot by itself. By moments, you completely forget that the characters are \"drawn\"; they just become \"real\".As for the humor, it was not tone down to little children. They were not the adult kind \u00e0-la-South-Park either. It was often satirical and you have to be at least 20-years-old to really understand some because of the history behind them. I had some tears twice because I laugh too hard in my seat.

The animation marks a welcome contrast from the virtually ubiquitous Disney template, with the human characters bearing a stylized, comic book exaggeration that fits perfectly with the story material.

It seemed that Disney had started to pick up some tricks from Warner Brothers, like the rapid-fire topical references and Hollywood-star-of-the-day caricature. Most people were pleased. It's orthodoxy in animation circles that the Warner Brothers style is a great one, much more lively than Disney's.I beg to differ. Warner Brothers cartoons are under-characterised, talky, brash WITHOUT being energetic, and they don't age well. They fail to be comic despite the fact that every other virtue is sacrificed for comedy's sake. I wish it to be said that none of this applies to the very fine efforts of Chuck Jones. SOME of his cartoons are masterpieces. But some - the Pepe Le Pew series, for example - are dreadful; and what has happened here, I think, is that he has been poisoned by the Warner Brothers style. So too has `Aladdin' been poisoned. In another decade everyone will have forgotten why Robin Williams was meant to be so funny and we will watch the genie only for Eric Goldberg's animation - which is technically superb, but a bit too literal, and too willing to follow Williams's lead.There are a couple of other flaws in `Aladdin' that will become more obvious as the years roll. For one thing, the computer generated images just don't fit the other images. (The Cave of Wonders is a visual debacle, which is sad, considering how good the rest of the art direction is.) More importantly, Aladdin isn't an appealing hero. Get this for shallow: he refuses to free the genie from servitude in order to perpetuate a deceit practised on Jasmine because of a crisis of confidence that, so far as one can tell from the opening song, he doesn't really feel.Of course we all know the film was a huge success, and it's not hard to see why: it offered the best character animation in the world, expertly staged songs, an uncynical look at an old story - all of the usual things, with a luscious princess thrown in. Like ALL of Disney's recent animated films it's easy to enjoy. But consider the other two of these films worked on by the team of Musker and Clements: `The Little Mermaid' and `Hercules'. `Aladdin', as much fun as it is, clearly lacks the heart of the former and the energy and technical brilliance of the latter, without offering a value-for-money trade off.

No one ever attempted such a task, not even the righteously famous \"new Hollywood\" western films, like (Blue Soldier) between many others. The original novel is carefully respected under every other aspect, and the result is a powerful, moving picture of what America once was, and of the people at which expense America has been built. In his directorial debut, Kostner displays what eventually has remained his distinguished mark: a style both magnificent and visionary (the buffalo hunting scene is masterful), with a notable sense of what cinema has to be: something larger than life, but made of life itself.This movie stands, in movie arts, as the greatest tribute Hollywood has ever made to Native Americans, and as a great lesson of national awareness for all who desired to know the dirty, mixed, deep roots of the United States of America."}, {"rank": 250, "name": "Dances with Wolves", "movie_year": "1990", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "An awesome epic that the Academy Awards righteously awarded 7 Oscars to. Like other monumental motion pictures (Casablanca, Titanic) it sets the story against a huge backdrop (in this case, the Civil War). After I saw this movie I wanted to buy a wolf for a pet. Later reality kicked in and I figured that would be a little dangerous and illegal. So I went and danced with my cat. I honestly do not understand why so many people put this movie down. Costner's performance was good not hideously bland and boring. Graham Greene would have won an oscar if Joe Pesci did not give a career performance in Goodfellas. The soundtrack is so good Mozart couldn't have done it better. My favorite scene is when Costner sees the Indian camp for the first time, simply stunning and timeless. I still believe Costner's direction rates among the best of all time, right up there with Coppola's \"Godfather\" and Kazan's \"On the Waterfront.\" The cinematography (beauty of the movie) looks better than heaven probably does. Costner's horse was fabulous and can outrun Black Beauty any day. For all those history freaks that declare this movie inaccurate, hello - did you see \"based on a true story\" anywhere in this motion picture. That comment is so bogus it's like putting down Star Wars because it's not a true story. If you enjoy history so much go read a history book. Some people say this movie is filled with Costner's conceit and greed. That's bogus too. You reward Clint Eastwood's Unforgiven and Mel Gibson's Braveheart when they both did the same thing (by the way I think both those movies are awesome as well). Just because a man in Hollywood does a huge amount of work on a particular picture (Stallone did the same thing with Rocky, as well as Thornton for Sling Blade) that d oesn't mean there character has to be so humble. I am happy Costner made himself a great character because he deserved it. I would have done the same thing if I did all that work and so would all of the critics out there who cut this movie up. Three thumbs up for a masterpiece. I recommend this movie to anyone who is alive."}, {"rank": 250, "name": "Dances with Wolves", "movie_year": "1990", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Very nice movie, one of the better ones by Kostner.

I only say that because Kevin Costner has not been very lucky since 1990 when he directed this masterpiece. But that hardly matters. This one film is worth a career. It is a lyrical, savage, and profound work of love and every frame shows it. This film also changed a lot of perceptions about Native Americans at the time. Not many films make it that far into the culture. A look a time when the European culture was beginning to supplant the civilization that preceded it, it has echoes of John Ford in its portrayal of the expansiveness and impermanence of the west, but it has a generosity of spirit toward its protagonists that Ford did not share. It is unfortunate that the film paints such an unqualified picture of the white man as Satan, but in the end, that is how he was perceived by the races he wiped out. It is a moving film set against a huge panorama. It's hard not to say that it is even \"important\" because that term is usually the kiss of death.

Not since Birth of a Nation has a film worn its racism so blatantly. Aside from the plodding pacing, simplistic dialogue and wooden performance of Costner, the film is rife with historical innaccuracies and half-truths. Who would know from watching this \"historical\" film that the Lakota Sioux were ruthless, vicious warriors who were not above scalping, mutilating and raping their victims? Who would know that the Pawnee actually had a reason to attack the Lakota, because they had been forced off their own land? It is exactly this sort of half-baked revisionist history that does an injustice to the very people the film tries to ennoble. Costner and Blake must not think much of their audience to portray every soldier as a buffoon and/or coward, and to make the \"bad\" Indians noticeably darker-skinned than the \"good Indians? This film should have come with a disclaimer stating that it is a work of fiction, because from reading and hearing people's responses to it, I am not sure the average viewer is smart enough to distinguish a well done movie from a piece of feel-good PC ego-stroking."}, {"rank": 250, "name": "Dances with Wolves", "movie_year": "1990", "comment_year": 1990, "comment": "Perhaps one of the most dishonest films ever made.

That story affected me, but I was too young to really understand and grasp everything that it was showing me. It wasn't until ten years later when I saw this film that something about the destructiveness of white people really hit me. There have been films that I have seen since that bothered me. Films like Instinct and Boyz and The Hood were eye openers as well, but this was one of the first ( along with Mississippi Burning ) that made me embarrassed for being white. I wanted to go outside and apologize to the world for the race that I belong to. It is that powerful of a film. This must have been something that Costner was building up to in the years past because this has to be an incredibly personal film to him because there is so much raw power and emotion put into it.DWW shows us that in-spite of what we have been taught by watching old Westerns, the natives, like any other race of people had their good points and their bad points. They weren't the war mongering people that we have been taught to believe. They had families, basically wanted to be left alone and were good at living by their own code. Once the white man came along and destroyed their world, everything changed. Although I am white, watching films like this and Mississippi Burning makes me ashamed of what white people are capable of. I realize people of all colours of skin can commit acts of genocide, but watching this film reminds me of how terrible my ancestors were 100's of years ago.I really applaud this film and I am so amazed that Costner did the job he did in his first effort. This film deserved every Oscar it received and if it wasn't for such an incredible performance from Joe Pesci, then Graham Greene probably would have taken home a best supporting actor Oscar.This is a really important film and it has something to say.

The character development of the main character could have used more body. Mr. Costner was excellent in his role; but it felt a little like he was holding back and could've given it more passion. The main Sioux characters were better developed. The story is compelling, and worthy of its awards; but perhaps some of what I was looking for was left on the editing room floor?

I had never watched such a lengthy film before and after I had been told by a few friends that this movie was at times tedious and slow, I feared the worst. However, this film is a work of greatness and kept my attention so well, I didn't notice the time at all.This movie is an eye opener to the struggles that the Sioux natives and I'm sure many other factions of natives had to go through during the second half of the 19th century. With the huge migration of people heading west it was only a matter of time until they were wiped out by the white man and his machines of war.This is a special movie for many reasons in my mind. First, it does a splendid job in describing the relationship between the Sioux and Lt. Dunbar from the beginning to the end. It is this relationship that the movie is based upon, and what makes the movie work so well. While watching the movie, I felt that I was Lt. Dunbar, not a third party watching the happenings. Secondly, the cast of Costner, Greene and McDonnell plays well together and perhaps should have been recognized by the academy. I can't really understand all that I've heard about how Costner's performance was lacking, because after all it is the center of the movie. Thirdly, the direction and cinematography of this film rank up there with such epics as Schindler's List and Lawrence of Arabia. It is basically flawless and plays the second most important role in the film.The story is told to every last detail and blended together perfectly. The ending also fits well and doesn't disappoint.
